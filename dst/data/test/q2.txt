The '''Scaled Chest''' is a craftable [[:Category:Containers|container]] in the ''[[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]]'' DLC. It requires an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype, and costs 1 [[Scales|Scale]], 4 [[Boards]], and 10 [[Gold Nugget]]s to craft. Unlike the regular [[Chest]], the Scaled Chest is [[fire]]proof and has 12 slots, as opposed to the normal [[Chest]]'s 9 slots.

[[Item]]s can be stored in a Scaled Chest by dragging them onto it or by opening the Chest to place them in specific slots. Chests help keep items better organized than by dropping them on the ground. Note that there are four [[Mobs]] in the game that can steal from, or knock items out of, chests; [[Splumonkey]]s, [[Krampus]], [[Slurtle]]s, and [[Bearger]].

In the ''[[Hamlet]]'' DLC, the Scaled Chest crafting recipe is unavailable, however, a [[Blueprint]] for it can be bought with 200 [[Oinc]]s from [[The Tinkerer's Tower]]. The Scales are available at [['The Sty' Oddities Emporium]]. Additionally, the Scaled Chest can be opened by [[Pog]]s.

== {{Pic32|Prototype}} Tips ==
* While Scaled Chests may seem desirable for a hot [[Summer]], due to the risk of spontaneous combustion and the [[Dragonfly]]'s natural vandalism for [[Ashes]], it is probably best to use Scales to craft [[Scalemail]] first, since the Dragonfly becomes much easier to fight after Scalemail is acquired, and in later Summers, the player may have enough gold to mass-produce Scaled Chests.
* The same functionality can be achieved with [[Piggyback]]s, with the only drawback being that players have to constantly equip and unequip the Piggybacks to check the items inside of them.
