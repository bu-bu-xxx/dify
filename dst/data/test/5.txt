# Wigfrid
Wigfrid is one of the two playable **Characters** exclusive to the **Reign of Giants** DLC. She is the seventh Character to be unlocked via **Experience**, with 1920 XP. She is also one of the playable Characters in **Don't Starve Together** (DST). Although Wigfrid has the appearance of a **Valkyrie**, she's just a stage actress.

## Origin
Wigfrid's backstory was revealed in the animated short **The Curtain Calls**. The short is officially summarized in DST's **Compendium**:
"Wigfrid always knew she was meant for the stage. Her debut performance was an instant sensation, launching her from obscurity to overnight stardom. Fans delighted in her portrayal of a noble and fearsome Valkyrie warrior, and she in turn took great pains to fully embody the role. She was perfect for it... perhaps too perfect. Every part she played afterward seemed to fall flat, never again achieving that magical quality that had once drawn audiences to her performances like bees to honey. As Wigfrid’s stardom slowly began to fade, she retreated to the memories of her glory days, losing herself in her fantasies...''

"Until one day, she was lost entirely."

## Trivia
### In-Game
- Wigfrid was added to **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** in the **A Feet of Strength** update on March 12, 2014.
- In **Don't Starve**, anytime Wigfrid uses the letter "O", she says it with umlauts ("Ö"), even if there are two in a row. In DST, only the first of consecutive "O"s will have an umlaut. Umlauts can be toggled in the settings, using the "Umlautify" option.
- Wigfrid is voiced by very processed brass horns.
- Despite Butterfly Wings/butter muffins being made from an animal, she cannot eat them.
- Wigfrid’s birthday is listed as March 23rd in the **Compendium**.
- While being described as excellent in combat, Wigfrid's bonuses are outclassed by those of other characters; most also have higher Hunger and Sanity while lacking her inability to eat non-meat foods. On the other hand, Wigfrid is the only character to have combat bonuses in so many fields (attack power, damage resistance, starting equipment, and health/Sanity regeneration), and she also lacks the other characters' weaknesses; overall, she is a "Jack of all trades, master of none" type of character when it comes to fighting.

### Lore
- Wigfrid dislikes **Mushrooms**, according to her **examination quotes**.
- Wigfrid is able to break character, as shown by her quotes when entering/leaving light ("And the curtain falls."; "I step intö the light!") and when examining a **Top Hat** ("It döesn't match my cöstume.") or a **Pirate Hat** ("This hat cönfuses my character... I mean, my söul.").
- Wigfrid's DST **loading screen vignette** is accompanied by text that reveals a bit about her acting skills: "The valor and confidence of a Valkyrie didn't always come naturally to Wigfrid. She cultivated her strength and persona over many years through sheer force of will."

### Cultural References
- Wigfrid is referred to as **Wathgrithr** in the game files, which comes from the name of a Valkyrie, Ráðgríðr (Rathgrithr).
- Wigfrid's role as an actress may be a reference to the famous opera cycle by Richard Wagner called **The Ring of The Nibelung**. Her name may be a reference to the same opera cycle's main character Siegfried, but the character is possibly based on the main female character, a valkyrie named Brynhilde.
- Her motto for DST is a reference to a **Shakespeare quote**.
- Toni from **Rhymes with Play** #201 said that Wigfrid's Victorian skin is based on an illustration by Alphonse Mucha, which depicts Sarah Bernhardt as Prince Hamlet from the **titular Shakespeare play**.
- Wigfrid's Contender skin set is called "The Ultimate Performer", which may be a reference to **The Ultimate Warrior**, a professional wrestler. Her mask even calls to mind The Ultimate Warrior's famous face paint.
- Her The Snowfallen skin possibly refers to frost giant or **Jötunn** from norse mythology.
