## Description
The **Piko** is a neutral **Mob** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. There is also a rarer orange variant called the **Orange Piko**. Both Piko and Orange Piko spawn from **Tea Tree**s and seem more likely to spawn near clumps of several trees growing close together. Each Piko has a "home tea tree" and will only climb this tree, unless caught in a **trap** and released. They will retreat to their home tree at dusk, when frightened, or after picking up an item. They will not leave the tree until next dawn or the player relogs. They do not seem to spawn from tea trees planted by the
