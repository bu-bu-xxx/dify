## Origin

Wilson was the first of the playable characters to receive a backstory through an animated short, called **Forbidden Knowledge**. The events of this short were later officially summarized in DST's Compendium:

> While toiling away in his home laboratory late one night, Wilson was startled to hear a voice on the radio speaking directly to him. At first he feared he'd gone mad from too many late nights of experiments and accidentally-inhaled chemical fumes, but the voice assured him that it was no mere figment of the imagination. In fact, the voice had a proposition for him: if Wilson would build a machine according to their specifications, then he would be rewarded with secret knowledge, the likes of which no one had ever seen. Casting aside his better judgement (after all, what harm could come from making a vague bargain with a mysterious disembodied voice?) Wilson threw himself into constructing the machine. When at long last it was finally completed, the gentleman scientist had a moment of hesitation... a moment that might have saved him from his impending fate, had he been just a bit stronger of will. But at the voice's insistence, Wilson flipped the switch and activated his creation... and was never seen again. Well, at least not in this world.

## Trivia

### In-Game

- Wilson's voice is played by a "Harmon muted trumpet (mixed with some cup muted trumpet as well)".
- With a Puffy Vest, a Beefalo Hat, and the Beard at full length, Wilson can have the highest insulation factor in the game at 615.
- Wilson is one of the only three characters that get an insulation bonus from their Beard. The other two are Webber from Reign of Giants (RoG), and Woodie when played in DST.
- Wilson is the only character capable of producing Beard Hair from shaving. His Beard is also the only one to allegedly be made of human hair.
- Wilson is the only character unaffected by the Strange New Powers update, aside from Maxwell, who was not finished in time and got his new powers later on in the All's Well That Maxwell update.
- Wilson is the only character with no drawbacks. Even in RoG, his Beard needs to be grown to accelerate overheating in Summer, which is not required of Wilson during that season.
- Wilson has a skull in the game files.
- Before the November 14, 2013 patch, Wilson used to share a lot of examination quotes with the other characters. His quotes are also used as the default for every other playable character when new objects are implemented in a beta stage.
- Wilson can be used as a Steam chat emoticon.
- Team Fortress 2 promoted Don't Starve with a hat modeled after Wilson's hair, as well as a weapon based on the Ham Bat.
- When struck by Lightning in DLCs, Wilson, like most other characters, is shown to have bones in his hair.
- Due to the short "Inevitable," Wilson is one of the few characters to have received actual voice acting, along with Maxwell, Charlie, and Willow.
- Wilson with Shadow Courtier can see Ink Blight's names.
- The Mad Lab Shoes were only added on August 31, 2022, despite the fact that the full set became available a few years earlier. Those who bought any set of skins that included the Wilsonâ€™s Mad Scientist skin received a red chest with Mad Lab Shoes upon entering the game. The chest appeared before the player could open the daily gift. Mad Lab Shoes were added in update 520864.
- All skins in Halloween Costumes Sets reference one mob from the game. Wilson's is the Guardian Pig.

### Lore

- From June to July 2012, a series of blog posts featured field notes written in Wilson's point of view, in which he recorded his initial experiences building tools, encountering Beefalo, and creating Meat Effigies in The Constant.
- Kevin Forbes has described Wilson as "a person of independent means who has decided to apply his intellect, such as it is, to science," and has stated that despite identifying as one, Wilson is not a good scientist.
- Wilson's full name originates from promotional business cards Klei had made for a conference. Kevin Forbes originally wrote the name with Percival in
