## Description
Wickerbottom is the fifth playable Character in Don't Starve that can be unlocked via Experience, with 1280 XP, and one of the playable Characters in Don't Starve Together (DST). She is an old, intelligent librarian who self-publishes and is able to identify many different types of fauna and flora by their scientific names.

## Origin
Wickerbottom's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled [One For the Books](https://youtu.be/15ESUxxJvZs). An official summary of the short was provided in DST's Compendium:

"When people meet Ms. Wickerbottom, most assume that what you see is what you get. She certainly looks every bit the typical librarian that she claims to be, as at home amongst the bookstacks as any creature in their native habitat. Nobody would raise an eyebrow at such a person being well-versed in a wide range of subjects. Who would spare a second thought if, upon further inquiry, her knowledge rivaled that of experts? And obviously, no one would think of questioning what a librarian might be involved in after hours, when the library doors are closed to the public...."

## Trivia
### In-Game
- Wickerbottom was added to Don't Starve in the Progress! update on January 29, 2013.
- Wickerbottom is played by an oboe.
- Wickerbottom's eyes are shut by default, but open sometimes, like when she exits a Worm Hole or is low on Sanity.
  - In DST, Wickerbottom is able to be put to sleep by a Pan Flute in PVP mode or by Bearger's yawn. Due to this, players are able to see that Wickerbottom sleeps with her eyes open, most likely due to her insomnia.
- While unable to sleep, Wickerbottom is still able to be knocked out by cooking a Mandrake or consuming a Cooked Mandrake.
- Wickerbottom has a skull in the game files.
- Wickerbottom's previous perk, before the Strange New Powers update, was to be able to prototype one tier higher than the other Characters, including Magic Items.
- When struck by Lightning in DLCs, Wickerbottom, like most other Characters, is shown to have bones in her hair. In addition to this, she also has bones in her skirt and shoes.
- Wickerbottom was the only female playable Character to have pupils and black, beady eyes, before Winona's release.
  - She is also the only character with separated pupils.

### Lore
- Wickerbottom's first name is unknown.
- Wickerbottom is fond of seafood, judging from her examination quotes for various fish dishes and her favorite food.
- Wilson believes that Wickerbottom has, or at least used to have, a pet cat. When Wickerbottom examines the Lucky Cat Jar, she sighs, and when she examines a Kittykit, she says "Now it feels like home.", which provides further evidence to this. This is also later confirmed in her animated short, One For the Books.
- When examining her book Birds of the World, she says that the Western screech owl is her favorite. This is also the particular bird species in The Screecher.
- She is the most literate of the Don't Starve characters and always refers to animals by their scientific names. The only exceptions to this are the creatures that are completely unknown to her. This can provide information as to what creatures in the Constant exist in her homeworld.
- She kept a garden at home, according to her quotes for a Potted Succulent ("I wonder how my garden is doing without me.") and Bloomfin Tuna ("Oh my, you'd look right at home in my old garden.").
- Wickerbottom's loading screen vignette from The Forge is accompanied by text that reveals a bit of her love of books: "Delightfully, Ms. Wickerbottom has found her passion for the written word has only deepened as the years
