# Exclusivity|Don't Starve Together
![Insight](Insight.png "Insight")

Insight is an in-game point system used to progress Skill Trees for Characters in Don't Starve Together. Characters can gain Insight Points and use them to unlock unique Skills. Insight Points are awarded after a number of days survived as the character, up to 15 total points after 68 days. Insight persists between games/worlds, as it is linked to a player's account. Note that time as a Ghost Characters|Ghost does not count toward gaining Insight Points.

There are more Skills to select from than total available Insight, meaning the player must deliberate between which Skills are to be unlocked. A character's unlocked Skills are reset on joining a new world/server, and can be reset in-game via using a Moon Rock Idol on the Celestial Portal in an existing world, allowing players to unlock different skills if they wish.
