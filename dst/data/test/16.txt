{{Quote|I get crazy when I don't sleep.|Wilson}}
'''Sanity''' is the [[Characters|Character]]'s "mental health" in ''[[Don't Starve]]''. The {{sanity}} Sanity icon, represented as a picture of a brain, is located near the character's {{hp}} Health and {{hunger}} Hunger. Characters can gain and lose sanity in various ways. A small animated arrow appears over the {{sanity}} icon, indicating an increase or decrease in Sanity. The size of the arrow signifies the rate of gain or loss.

As sanity decreases, the player's vision becomes shaky, over-saturated, and bright, whispers are heard, and [[Shadow Creature]]s start to appear. These creatures become "physical" and aggressive and will attack the player when their sanity is below 15%. When sanity is low, the player's character covers their ears and closes their eyes while rocking back and forth, as if experiencing a bad headache.

Being alone in the wilderness will take its toll. Generally speaking, being in close proximity to [[Monsters]], [[Darkness]], [[Rain]], eating bad or raw [[Food]], or using various magic items decreases sanity; while wearing certain [[Dress|clothing]], eating [[Jerky]] and [[Crock Pot]] food, being near friendly [[Pigs]], and [[sleeping]] increases sanity. See the Sanity Tables below for a complete list.
