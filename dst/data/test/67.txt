The **Cartography Filter** is a **Filter** in the crafting menu of **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It allows the players to craft items using the **Cartographer's Desk**. Similar to the **Ancient Pseudoscience Filter** and the **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**, items under this Filter cannot be prototyped and then made on the go in the future; in order to craft an item under this Filter, the player must always be near a Cartographer's Desk, no matter how many times the item has been crafted.

## Craftable Items
- **Map Scroll** | [Map Scroll](link=Map Scroll)

## Trivia
* The original Cartography Tab was introduced in the **A Little Fixer Upper** update. With the introduction of **Crafting Filters** in the **March 2022 QoL update**, it was replaced by the Cartography Filter.
* Before the introduction of crafting filters, players were not able to access the Cartography Tab while **Creative Mode** was turned on because the Cartography Tab shared the same space with the **Ancient Tab**.
* **Cartography** is the science and practice of making maps.
