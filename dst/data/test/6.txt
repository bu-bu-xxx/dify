### Description
Purple Groupers are a Fish Food Item introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. They can be obtained by stocking Fish Farms with Roe, together with Pierrot Fish, Neon Quattro Fish, and Tropical Fish. They can be used in the Crock Pot and count as 0.5 units of Meat and 1 unit of Fish. They are specifically required to cook the Tropical Bouillabaisse. Purple Groupers cannot be dried using a Drying Rack.

When consumed, Purple Groupers grant the player a speed increase of 2 and prevent the player from having their wetness increased or their Boat damaged by both common and big waves for 30 seconds. The speed bonus will stack with the bonus from Pierrot Fish and other sources, but will not stack with the bonus from Tropical Bouillabaisse.
