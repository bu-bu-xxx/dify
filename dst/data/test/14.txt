## Scrapbook Info
Used to mark a spot, and then used again to teleport to that spot. 8 minute cooldown. Even works between the Cave and the Forest.

The Backtrek Watch gives Wanda the ability to set a waypoint in space, and teleport to that spot at any time. The Watch has an 8 minute (1 day) cooldown, and is able to transport the player between shards (meaning between Surface and Cave in normal game). After the watch has been activated, the examination changes to "Is it time for us to take a dip in the timestream?" letting the player know whether or not a destination has already been set. Should the destination be set within a different shard (usually the Caves if you are within the Surface shard and vice versa), her examination will change to "It'll be a big jump, but I can make it!". It requires 2 Time Pieces, 2 Gold Nuggets and a Walrus Tusk to craft.
