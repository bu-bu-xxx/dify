The Antlion is a Mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in A New Reign. It appears in the Desert biome during Summer Season. The players can either appease or kill it, otherwise, it creates Sinkholes on the surface or Cave-in Boulder when a player goes inside the caves. The Antlion can be given a Thermal Stone at stage 1 to freeze it and start combat, or one at stages 4 or 5 to set it on fire and start combat. (If you want to use a hot thermal stone, you need to heat it by Antlion as it will loose heat instantly away from fire in summer, making this impractical)

## Behavior
Antlion first spawns in Summer when there is no rain and the ground is dry. 33 minutes and 36 seconds (roughly four days) after it spawns it will disturb the players unless tribute is paid to delay it. When the attack is complete, Antlion's disturbance timer will be set to 80% of the previous calm duration.

If it rains while the Antlion is Alive, it will despawn, respawning later with a reset timer at 33 minutes 36 seconds when the rain stops.

### Tribute
Players can contribute the following items to delay the Antlion's disturbance:

| **Days** | **Items** |
| --- | --- |
| 1/3 | Rocks, Egg, Second-hand Dentures, Bent Spork, Air Unfreshener, Leaky Teacup, Shoe Horn, Collected Dust |
| 2/3 | Melty Marbles, Gord's Knot, Tiny Rocketship, Ball and Cup, Frayed Yarn, Wire Hanger, White Bishop, Black Bishop, White Rook, Black Rook, White Knight, Black Knight, Gnome, Gnomette, Frazzled Wires, Lying Robot, Beaten Beater, Fake Kazoo, Toy Trojan Horse, Unbalanced Top |
| 1 | Cut Stone, Mismatched Buttons, Back Scratcher, Hardened Rubber Bung, Dessicated Tentacle, Lucky Cat Jar, Potato Cup |
| 2 | Thermbell, Red Crown |
| 3 | Beach Toy |
| 4 | Heat Stone Stage 2, Heat Stone Stage 3 |

For example, if one gives the Antlion an Egg, it would delay its attacks for 160 seconds, or 1/3 day. Giving the Antlion 10 Rocks will delay the disturbance timer by 3.3 days. One should keep
