The **Brush** is a craftable **Item** found in the **Tools Tab**. It requires 1 **Steel Wool**, 1 **Walrus Tusk** and 2 **Gold** to craft, and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. When used on a **Beefalo** one **Beefalo Wool** will be obtained, obedience level increased by 40% and domestication by 1.6% (domestication level only increases once per day).

## {{pic32|Prototype}} Tips
- The Brush can be used multiple times on the same Beefalo, but will only be beneficial the first time it is used per day. Thus, it should be used once per day on each Beefalo that is being tamed.
- Using a **Deconstruction Staff** will give back all the materials, enabling the creation of endless brushes with only 1 required Steel Wool.

## {{pic32|Placeholder}} Trivia
- The Brush was first introduced to **Don't Starve Together**. It was later added to **Don't Starve** in the **Don't Starve/Version History|Quality of Life** update.
- The Brush is considered to be part of **A New Reign**, even though it was introduced before the official start of the beta branch.
