### Additional Content

Don't Starve Together includes almost all content of the base game and the [[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]] DLC. Some features from the [[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]] and [[Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet]] DLCs were also introduced over time. Additionally, several new entities were added to re-balance characters, giants, and seasonal mechanics for the multiplayer aspect of the game.

## Rebalancing

Don't Starve Together features [[Caves]] and [[Ruins]], which must be toggled on via a tab in the Server Creation menu. The Caves and Ruins now share the same map level, since each map level requires a separate server.

### Sleeping

Sleeping has been significantly changed. Normally, when going to sleep, the day would fast-forward to sunrise and replenish [[health]] and [[sanity]] at the cost of [[hunger]] upon waking up. However, when on a server, sleeping will not fast forward to sunrise but will instead leave the player unable to move and unaffected by the [[Charlie (Night Monster)|night monster]]. This will replenish health and sanity while draining hunger faster
