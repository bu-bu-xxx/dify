The Cat Cap is a Category:Hats Item in the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC. It is found in the Dress Tab, requires 1 Cat Tails and 4 Silk to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The Sewing Kit repairs 50% of its durability.

Cat Caps restore 3.3 Sanity/min while worn and are tier 1 warm clothing items, increasing the time a character can be without a fire during the Winter before Freezing. They have an insulation factor of 60.

Since Catcoons can easily go extinct on a map, and only drop their Cat Tails by chance, it is best to keep this Hat maintained with a Sewing Kit.

**Downloadable Content:**
Cat Caps are also included in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, however, they cannot be crafted. Instead, they can be bought for 10 Oincs at The Sow's Ear Hat Shop in the Pig City.

**Trivia:**
- Since Catcoon is a portmanteau of "cat " and "raccoon", this item is most likely based on the real life Wikipedia:Coonskin_cap|Coonskin Cap, made most famous by the frontiersman Wikipedia:Davy_Crockett|Davy Crockett. Wickerbottom's quote references this by saying "Not quite like Crockett's, but it'll do."
- Visually, the Cat Cap also resembles an Wikipedia:Ushanka|Ushanka Cap.
- In older versions of Reign of Giants, the Cat Cap had resistance to wetness and was dropped outright by killing Catcoons.
