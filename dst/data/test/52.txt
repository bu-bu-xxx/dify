# Star Caller's Staff

The **Star Caller's Staff** is a craftable [[Item]] found in the [[Ancient Tab]]. It requires 4 [[Nightmare Fuel]], 2 [[Living Log]]s, 2 [[Yellow Gem]]s, and a broken [[Ancient Pseudoscience Station]] to craft. It also can randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when damaged with a [[Hammer]], [[Gunpowder]] etc., and has a 25% chance to be found inside a [[Large Ornate Chest]]. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Star Caller's Staves cannot be prototyped and can only be made near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

With each use of the staff, the Survivor holding it will lose 20 {{sanity}} and the Staff will lose 5% of its [[Durability]] to summon a Dwarf Star. Due to the nature of [[Darkness]], the Dwarf Star cannot be summoned directly in the middle of Darkness, so more preemptive measures are needed to avoid being bitten by the Night Monster.

## Dwarf Star

### Object Infobox
- **name**: Dwarf Star
- **image**: Dwarf Star.gif
- **perk**: Provides light, heat.<br>Can cook.
- **durability**: 3.5 days
- **sanitybonus**: +25/min<br>+35/min ([[File:Willow Portrait.png|24px|link=Willow]])
- **spawnCode**: "stafflight"
- **spawnFrom**: {{pic24|Star Caller's Staff}}, {{pic|24|Ancient Pseudoscience Station}} ({{pic24|Hammer}})

When equipping the Star Caller's Staff in the hand slot, it can be used on any visible point on the ground to summon a Dwarf Star (it can also be randomly summoned by hitting an [[Ancient Pseudoscience Station]] with a hammer).

A single Dwarf Star will last 28 minutes (3.5 in-game days). With 20 uses, this means a single staff will yield a total of 70 days of Dwarf Stars. During that time it provides a fluctuating radius of light, heat equivalent to that of a 3rd tier [[Campfire]] fire (180 units; the 4th and highest tier is 220 units of heat) and a [[Sanity]] boost of 25 {{sanity}} per minute while standing near it.

The Dwarf Star can also be used to [[Cooking|cook]] [[Food]], similar to a Campfire. It can also burn flammable objects that are too close to it, so caution is advised as to where the staff is used.

In the ''[[Reign of Giants]]'' DLC, the Dwarf Star provides the highest amount of heat instead (more than a fully fueled Fire Pit) and standing near it for too long can cause [[Overheating]], even during [[Winter]].

## Tips

* It's a good idea to equip a [[Construction Amulet]] when crafting this Staff, to save one [[Yellow Gem]].
* While the Staff cannot be used in the dark, it can still be used a few seconds before complete darkness settles in. The light given off when summoning the Dwarf Star will provide protection from [[Charlie]].
* Staying close to the Dwarf Star will cause a net bonus of 30{{sanity}}. Excluding outside factors, this results in no Sanity cost from using the Staff.
  * [[Willow]]'s Sanity regeneration perk works with the Dwarf Star too resulting in 50{{sanity}} recovered.
  * There is no limit to the amount of Dwarf Stars that players can summon at the same time and their Sanity boosts stack with each-other. This means that players can summon multiple Dwarf Stars at the same spot to boost their Character's Sanity quicker.

## Trivia

* The Star Caller's Staff was added in the ''[[Don't Starve/Version History|Hungry For Your Hunger]]'' update. Its crafting requirement was changed during the ''[[Don't Starve/Version History|Stuff of Nightmares]]'' update.
