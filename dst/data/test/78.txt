# Floats

Floats are **Items** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. Their sole purpose is to be combined with a **Sea Fishing Rod** to improve the casting range and accuracy of the landing. Most of them can be crafted in the **Fishing Filter**, requiring a **Tackle Receptacle** to prototype, while some of them can also be acquired by trading with the **Crabby Hermit** in the **Bottle Exchange Filter**.

The **Hardened Rubber Bung** Trinket can also be used as a Float, however, it cannot be crafted.

Below is a table of the performance statistics for all Floats.

## Trivia

* Floats were introduced in the **Hook, Line, and Inker** update.
* Before the 2022 March QOL Update, the crafting recipes for the Jet, Crimson, Azure, Saffron, Down, and the Malbatross Quill Float were unlocked by giving their corresponding Adverts to a Tackle Receptacle. Only the Advert for the Jet Quill Float remains in the game.
