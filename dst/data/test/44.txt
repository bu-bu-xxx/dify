# Combat Damage Mechanics

Combat is a gameplay mechanism that allows players or mobs to fight each other, reducing each other's health. When a player or mob is attacked or exposed to an environmental hazard, a series of calculations determine how much damage is taken and how much health is lost.

## Damage

### Physical Damage
Physical Damage is the most common type of damage in the game. Every mob, before enabling Rifts, only deals physical damage that can be absorbed by Armor's Protection or reduced by mobs' Planar Entity Protection. Physical Damage can be affected by damage multipliers, such as:

- **Wes**, **Wendy**: deal 25% less damage.
- **Wigfrid**: deal 25% more damage.
- **Wolfgang**: deal x0.75 - x2 damage, based on his mightiness.
- **Wanda**: based on her age and weapon she uses.
- **Volt Goat Chaud-Froid**: grants a x1.5 damage boost (x2.5 when target is wet) for 5 minutes.
- Dishes with **Chili Flakes**: deal 20% more damage for 4 minutes.
- **W.A.R.B.I.S. Head Gear**: gives 5% - 20% physical damage boost.

#### Weapons with Physical Damage
Almost every Weapon deals physical damage, more or less. It is recommended for players to get a **Ham Bat** or **Dark Sword** for their high damage. These weapons, however, will not be as efficient against Rift mobs with Planar Entity Protection.

### Planar Damage
Planar Damage is a new type of damage introduced in "From Beyond", and it does not get affected by the damage multipliers mentioned above. Unlike Physical Damage, Planar Damage cannot be blocked by Armor's Protection or reduced by Planar Entity Protection. It is only affected by Armor's Planar Defense or Damage Reduction.
