The **Tropical Fan** is an **Item** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC and its counterpart of the **Luxury Fan** in the **Reign of Giants** DLC. It can be crafted with five **Doydoy Feathers**, two **Cut Reeds** and two **Rope**s and requires an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.

Like a Luxury Fan, it puts out nearby fires and reduces body temperature of the player by 50°, but will never reduce temperature to below 2.5 °C.

### Trivia
- The Tropical Fan was introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#January 14th, 2016 - Eye of the Tiger Shark Update**.
