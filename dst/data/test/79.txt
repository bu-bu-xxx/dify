## Description
Birchnuts are [[Food]] [[item]]s dropped from [[Birchnut Tree]]s or [[Birchnutter]]s in the ''[[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]]'' DLC. Like [[Pine Cone]]s, Birchnuts can be planted to create a new Birchnut Tree. It takes from 2.5 to 5 minutes for them to grow from saplings into small trees. Birchnuts can alternatively be used as a [[food]] [[:Category:Items|item]] by being [[Cooking|cooked]] on a [[campfire]] and turned into a roasted Birchnut.

Birchnuts can't be planted on [[Checkerboard Flooring]]s, [[Wooden Flooring]]s, [[Cobblestone]]s, [[Carpeted Flooring]]s, [[Rocky Turf]]s, [[Sandy Turf]]s, and [[Cave Rock Turf]]s, unless it has been planted before these [[Turfs]] were placed.
