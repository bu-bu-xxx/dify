## Tips
- Because Slurpers do not respawn without regenerating the Caves with the Seed of Ruin, it's recommended to use the Sewing Kit on the Belt of Hunger to repair it rather than letting it degrade and crafting a new one.
- A single use of the Sewing Kit restores enough durability to prevent 151 points worth of hunger drain, comparable to Meaty Stew. This makes sewing a Belt of Hunger an extremely efficient way prevent starvation.
- This item is excellent for Wolfgang, as it completely nullifies his hunger problems and for Wigfrid, since her inability to eat non-Meaty foods can be very risky, especially when traveling to distant places from base.
- It's also useful for Wes and Wilbur, due to practically nullifying their increased hunger drain (when running, for the latter).
