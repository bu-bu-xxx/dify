The Howling Conch is a craftable Item introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It is found in the Volcanic Tab and requires 4 Obsidian, 1 Purple Gem, and 1 Magic Seal to craft. Like all items in the Volcanic Tab, it cannot be prototyped and the player must be near an Obsidian Workbench or wearing a Brain of Thought to craft it.

Using the Howling Conch will start Strong Winds lasting for about half a Day. When taken to a base game world or Reign of Giants world with the Seaworthy or Skyworthy, the conch will create Rain instead of Strong Winds lasting for about half a Day. This allows for a Reign of Giants world in Summer to not trigger smoldering as long as the Rain stays.

## Tips
* The Sail Stick can be equipped after blowing the Howling Conch for half a day of boosted sailing speed, but a Walking Cane still provides a greater speed boost when sailing with the wind.
* Using the Howling Conch while its effects are still active may initiate a hurricane outside of Hurricane Season with the associated rain and lightning. This is useful for WX-78 players in need of Overcharge or Walani players who want more waves to ride during Dry Season.

## Bugs
* The light of day will become dimmer when using the Howling Conch in a Don't Starve or Reign of Giants due to the Rain.
* Sometimes when trying to create Rain, the Howling Conch will not work until the light of day (not exactly when it becomes the afternoon) becomes dimmer.

## Trivia
* The crafting menu description and Woodie's quote reference the song "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" by Canadian musician Gordon Lightfoot.
