## Survival

![Wilson-overheat](Wilson-overheat.png =300x)

Overheating can be overcome in two ways: by reducing the player's temperature, and by preventing player's temperature from rising rapidly. Surviving Summer or Dry Season will depend on a combination of these.

### Cooling Down

There are several ways to cool oneself down:

* An Endothermic Fire, Endothermic Fire Pit, or Moon Caller's Staff|Polar Light is a stationary light source that works like a fire, but they cool the player instead.
* A Chilled Amulet, Ice Cube, or Fashion Melon will lower temperature when worn. Note that these have different cooling values. The Ice Cube and Fashion Melon will also cause Wetness while worn, so caution is advised especially as WX-78.
* Using a Luxury Fan or Lucky Fan will lower the player's temperature instantly. The Luxury Fan has 15 uses while the Lucky Fan has 3 uses. However, when used, they put out fires, so the player should be wary around light sources.
* Equipping the Whirly Fan will also lower the player's temperature, but only while the player is running.
* Eating one of the following food items will temporarily cool the player down by 1°C per second for various amounts of time. Eating even stale or spoiled food can also cool the player down.

| Food Item         | Cool Down Time |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Watermelon        | 5 seconds     |
| Fruit Medley      | 5 seconds     |
| Ice               | 7.5 seconds   |
| Melonsicle        | 10 seconds    |
| Ice Cream         | 15 seconds    |
| Ceviche           | 10 seconds    |
| Banana Pop        | 10 seconds    |
| Jelly-O Pop       | 10 seconds    |
| Neon Quattro      | 10 seconds    |
| Tropical Bouillabaisse | 10 seconds |
| Iced Tea         | 10 seconds    |
| Asparagazpacho   | 40 degrees lower than environment for 5 minutes. |

* Wetness will decrease gained temperature up to 30°C at the cost of Sanity and negative effects on items.
* The player can sleep during the day in a Siesta Lean-to to cool down and skip to dusk, thus preventing further overheating.
* A Thermal Stone can be brought near an Endothermic Fire or Endothermic Fire Pit to cool it or placed in a stationary Ice Box or a mobile Snow Chester to freeze it. It will cool the player down as long as it's in stage 1 or stage 2.
* The cheapest way to cool down is to run around a Tree holding a Whirly Fan.

### Delaying Overheating

There are several ways to delay overheating:

* Retreating to the Caves will slow down the rate at which heat is gained (240 Insulation).
* Dusk and Night will slow down the rate at which heat is gained (60/
