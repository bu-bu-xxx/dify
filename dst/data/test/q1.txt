The '''Scaled Furnace''' is a craftable [[Structure]] exclusive to ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'', introduced in ''[[A New Reign]]''. It can be found in the [[Light Sources Filter]], [[Structures Filter]] and
[[Cooking Filter]] after the player obtains the [[Blueprint]] by either killing the [[Dragonfly]] or as a random drop from [[Loot Stash]], after killing [[Klaus]]. It can then be crafted using 2 [[Red Gem]]s, 10 [[Charcoal]] and 1 [[Scales]]. The Furnace provides heat in a wide radius (which can quickly overheat the player), and light in a very small radius, and allows the player to [[Cooking|cook]] [[Food]]. Currently, this structure affects the player in the same way as the [[Magma|Magma Pools]] found in the [[Desert]] [[biome]], except it won't set the player on fire.  The heat from a Scaled Furnace radiates heat 2 tiles as opposed to a single tile from a [[Campfire]] or [[Endothermic Fire]] (pit or non-pit versions).

It also has 4 slots in which you can put almost any item. Doing this will destroy the item. You cannot use it as storage. If you put a living creature there and destroy it, you will receive some points of naughtiness. Also burning a creature or [[Living Log]] will cause them to scream. You can also put [[Thermal Stone]] there and wait a bit. In this case, the [[Thermal Stone]] will heat up.

=={{Pic32|Prototype}} Tips== 
*Placing [[Thermal Stone]]s next to the Scaled Furnace is a great way to heat them up efficiently, as no fuel is needed for the Scaled Furnace.
*A fully fuelled [[Campfire]] will heat a thermal stone hotter than the Scaled Furnace.
**However, 2 Scaled Furnaces next to each other will heat a thermal stone better than a Campfire.

=={{Pic32|Placeholder}} Trivia == 
*The Scaled Furnace was added in the ''[[A New Reign#September 23rd, 2016 - Warts and All|Warts and All]]'' update.
*In the ''Rhymes with Play'' stream it was revealed on, it was accidentally read as "Salad Furnace". "saladfurnace" has been added alongside it as an easter egg, and is in fact just a green reskin of the Scaled Furnace. 
**It can be spawned by entering in the command <code>c_spawn ("saladfurnace")</code>.
*It used to be unable to cook food before [[Don't Starve Together/Version History#September 28, 2016|update 191674]].
*There are unused quotes within the game files for when the Furnace's fire is high, normal and out, as well as when it has been damaged by a hammer. These could be either leftovers from when it was supposed to work with fuel or planned features. 
**Additionally, these also reveal it was meant to be refueled by Red Gems.
*A Scaled Furnace can ripen [[Saladmander|Saladmanders]].
