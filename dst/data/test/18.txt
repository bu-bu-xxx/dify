The Portable Crock Pot is a character-specific Item that Warly begins the game with. It acts as a Crock Pot that can be moved and replaced. It must be placed on the ground to cook anything.

While cooking, the Portable Crock Pot gives just enough light to ward off Charlie, but the sanity drain is equivalent of staying in total darkness, therefore, this is not recommended. It can also make exclusive recipes.

## Trivia

- The Portable Crockpot was exclusive to the Shipwrecked DLC, until it was introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Warly Character Update.

## Bugs

- In Don't Starve: Shipwrecked, if the player places a Portable Crock Pot inside a Cargo Boat or Chester, exits the game and then relogs, a second Portable Crock Pot will appear in the player's inventory as the game considers the original one to be missing.
- The same bug will occur when the player enters a Cave without the Portable Crock Pot in the inventory. Relogging is not necessary for this to occur.
