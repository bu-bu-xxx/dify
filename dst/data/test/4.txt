The Rain Hat is a craftable Dress item from the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC. It requires 2 Moleworms, 1 Straw Hat, and 1 Bone Shard to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The Sewing Kit repairs 50% of its durability.

When worn during Rain, it protects against Wetness gain by 70%. Additionally, it insulates the player against Lightning strikes and the electric shocks of a charged Volt Goat.

## Trivia
- Rain Hats require Moleworms to craft because the moleskin is known for its water-resistance.
- The crafting recipe used to require Tentacle Spots instead of Moleworms.
- Wearing this hat while standing under a Tree provides sufficient Wetness protection from rain.
