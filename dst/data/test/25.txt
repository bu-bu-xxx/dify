# Red Gem
The Red Gem is an Item used to craft several Magical items. It can be used to craft the Fire Staff, Night Light, Life Giving Amulet, and Purple Gem.

## Obtaining Red Gems
Red Gems can be obtained from Graves, as a drop from Red Hounds, from trading a Sextant to Wolly, from Earthquakes and Stalagmites in Caves, and from Ancient Statues, Broken Clockworks, and Ornate Chests in Ruins. They can also be found as a single, one time drop from hammering the Sunken Boat.

## Downloadable Content
### Reign of Giants
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Red Gems have a 0.02% chance to be dropped by Tumbleweeds.

### Shipwrecked
In the Shipwrecked DLC, Fishing with Trawl Net in deep Ocean has a small chance to catch a red gem. The chance is higher during Hurricane Season and Dry Season. Magma Piles in Magma Field biomes also have a chance to drop them.

### Hamlet
In Hamlet, Red Gems can be obtained by hammering A Smashing Pot, killing the Pugalisk, trawling in the Lily Ponds, finding them atop pedestals in Ancient Pig Ruins, and mining the Petrified Eggs in the BFB's nest.
