## Quote
"You haven't heard the last of Maybelle Dorothea Wheeler!" - Wheeler

### Maybelle Dorothea Wheeler
Maybelle Dorothea Wheeler is a **Character** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. Wheeler is the tenth character to be unlocked via **Experience**, requiring 3200 XP to become available. She is an adventure-seeking aeronaut who crashed her hot air balloon and became lost in **The Constant**.

## Trivia
- Wheeler was officially added to the **Hamlet** Early Access beta branch on **April 18, 2019**, alongside **Wagstaff**.[^1]
- Wheeler is voiced by a ragtime piano.
- In the roadmap forum post where she was first teased, she was described as "''a globetrotting adventurer lost and alone.''"[^2]
- On the [Steam page for **Hamlet**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/712640/Dont_Starve_Hamlet/), she is described as "''A gutsy aeronaut whose latest adventure has blown off course.''"
- Her middle name, Dorothea, may be a reference to **Dorothy** of **The Wonderful Wizard of Oz**.
- In her original in-game design, she had a frown and neutral eyebrows. In the **Early Access update 329526**, it was changed to give her a smile and angled eyebrows similar to her character portrait.[^3] Images depicting her previous design can be found in the **gallery**.
- During the first versions of **Hamlet**, Wheeler used to have 15 inventory slots and her base **movement speed** was 10% higher compared to other characters. She also used to have 10 inventory slots and 150 **Hp**.
- She has a history playing stick ball.[^4]
- Her health is the second least in the singleplayer version of the game, the first being **Maxwell**'s.
- Wheeler is one of the five characters whose full name is known, the others being **Maxwell**, **Wilson**, **Wendy**, and **Wagstaff**.
- When struck by **Lightning**, Wheeler is shown to have bones in her hair, much like other characters.
- Wheeler seems to love scrambled eggs, based off of her quotes for multiple egg foods, such as **Doydoy Eggs**, **Fried Tallbird Eggs**, and **Cooked Eggs**.
