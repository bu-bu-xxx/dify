## Trivia
- The Dapper Vest was added in the "The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You" update.
- The Dapper Vest requires Hound's Teeth to make because its pattern is called houndstooth. This is a pun by the developers.
- Because the Dapper Vest restores 3.3 Sanity/min and Rain drains a maximum of 3.3 Sanity/min, the Dapper Vest can be used to negate or reverse the Sanity drain of Rain.
- The Dapper Vest is one out of the two best Sanity restoring body items in the game, excluding the RoG exclusive Hibearnation Vest.
- Along with several other clothing items, the Dapper Vest used to not have any durability.
