The '''Scaled Furnace''' is a craftable [[Structure]] exclusive to ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'', introduced in ''[[A New Reign]]''. It can be found in the [[Light Sources Filter]], [[Structures Filter]] and
[[Cooking Filter]] after the player obtains the [[Blueprint]] by either killing the [[Dragonfly]] or as a random drop from [[Loot Stash]], after killing [[Klaus]]. It can then be crafted using 2 [[Red Gem]]s, 10 [[Charcoal]] and 1 [[Scales]]. The Furnace provides heat in a wide radius (which can quickly overheat the player), and light in a very small radius, and allows the player to [[Cooking|cook]] [[Food]]. Currently, this structure affects the player in the same way as the [[Magma|Magma Pools]] found in the [[Desert]] [[biome]], except it won't set the player on fire.  The heat from a Scaled Furnace radiates heat 2 tiles as opposed to a single tile from a [[Campfire]] or [[Endothermic Fire]] (pit or non-pit versions).

It also has 4 slots in which you can put almost any item. Doing this will destroy the item. You cannot use it as storage. If you put a living creature there and destroy it, you will receive some points of naughtiness. Also burning a creature or [[Living Log]] will cause them to scream. You can also put [[Thermal Stone]] there and wait a bit. In this case, the [[Thermal Stone]] will heat up.

=={{Pic32|Prototype}} Tips== 
*Placing [[Thermal Stone]]s next to the Scaled Furnace is a great way to heat them up efficiently, as no fuel is needed for the Scaled Furnace.
*A fully fuelled [[Campfire]] will heat a thermal stone hotter than the Scaled Furnace.
**However, 2 Scaled Furnaces next to each other will heat a thermal stone better than a Campfire.

=={{Pic32|Placeholder}} Trivia == 
*The Scaled Furnace was added in the ''[[A New Reign#September 23rd, 2016 - Warts and All|Warts and All]]'' update.
*In the ''Rhymes with Play'' stream it was revealed on, it was accidentally read as ""Salad Furnace"". ""saladfurnace"" has been added alongside it as an easter egg, and is in fact just a green reskin of the Scaled Furnace. 
**It can be spawned by entering in the command <code>c_spawn (""saladfurnace"")</code>.
*It used to be unable to cook food before [[Don't Starve Together/Version History#September 28, 2016|update 191674]].
*There are unused quotes within the game files for when the Furnace's fire is high, normal and out, as well as when it has been damaged by a hammer. These could be either leftovers from when it was supposed to work with fuel or planned features. 
**Additionally, these also reveal it was meant to be refueled by Red Gems.
*A Scaled Furnace can ripen [[Saladmander|Saladmanders]].

The '''Scaled Chest''' is a craftable [[:Category:Containers|container]] in the ''[[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]]'' DLC. It requires an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype, and costs 1 [[Scales|Scale]], 4 [[Boards]], and 10 [[Gold Nugget]]s to craft. Unlike the regular [[Chest]], the Scaled Chest is [[fire]]proof and has 12 slots, as opposed to the normal [[Chest]]'s 9 slots.

[[Item]]s can be stored in a Scaled Chest by dragging them onto it or by opening the Chest to place them in specific slots. Chests help keep items better organized than by dropping them on the ground. Note that there are four [[Mobs]] in the game that can steal from, or knock items out of, chests; [[Splumonkey]]s, [[Krampus]], [[Slurtle]]s, and [[Bearger]].

== {{Pic32|Gift Icon}} Downloadable Content ==
In the ''[[Hamlet]]'' DLC, the Scaled Chest crafting recipe is unavailable, however, a [[Blueprint]] for it can be bought with 200 [[Oinc]]s from [[The Tinkerer's Tower]]. The Scales are available at [['The Sty' Oddities Emporium]]. Additionally, the Scaled Chest can be opened by [[Pog]]s.

== {{Pic32|Prototype}} Tips ==
* While Scaled Chests may seem desirable for a hot [[Summer]], due to the risk of spontaneous combustion and the [[Dragonfly]]'s natural vandalism for [[Ashes]], it is probably best to use Scales to craft [[Scalemail]] first, since the Dragonfly becomes much easier to fight after Scalemail is acquired, and in later Summers, the player may have enough gold to mass-produce Scaled Chests.
* The same functionality can be achieved with [[Piggyback]]s, with the only drawback being that players have to constantly equip and unequip the Piggybacks to check the items inside of them.

{{Scrapbook Info|Can be placed on dirt ground to change the type of ground.}}
'''Scaled Flooring''' is a type of craftable [[Turfs|Turf]] in ''[[Don't Starve Together]].'' It is crafted with [[Scales]] and a [[Cut Stone]]. Like all other turfs, and in spite of its fireproof qualities, Scaled Flooring can be used as fuel and can be lit on fire if left on the ground as an item.

Scaled Flooring helps decrease the amount of heat an object or structure absorbs from open fire sources, therefore slowing the spread of fire. However, this effect does not stop things from being ignited in the heat or manually lit on fire (such as with a torch). The effect is also only extended to objects and structures which are placed fully on top of them.

Scaled Flooring slows the rate at which fires make adjacent objects smolder. It does not block heat; [[Thermal Stone]]s and players will still heat up at normal distances from heat sources.  Directly lighting objects on fire (with a [[Torch]]) behaves normally on Scaled Flooring, as do fires buring once lit or the progression of a single item smoldering once started.

=={{Pic32|Prototype}} Tips==
* Scaled Flooring can be used to duplicate Scales by using a [[Deconstruction Staff]], since four Scaled Flooring are made each batch. This can be used to mass-produce Scales from at least one Scales.
