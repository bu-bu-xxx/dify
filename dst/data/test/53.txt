## Fire
Fire is a commonly-occurring game mechanic.

Fire is very important for various reasons. Primarily, it is used to provide light at [Night](#), which prevents [Charlie (Night Monster)](#) from attacking. Additionally, fire allows food to be [Cooking](#), increasing its [Hunger](#) and [Health](#) values. Fire also provides warmth during [Winter](#), which counteracts [freezing](#). Despite these benefits however, fire can also be dangerous, as being too close to one will drain Health.

Flaming items or objects may have different descriptions than non-burning ones; for example, a burning log versus one that's just sitting there.

### Light
There are several sources of fire which provide light. Most of these can be found in the [Light Tab](#), represented by the Campfire icon. These sources include [Campfire](#)s, [Fire Pit](#)s, [Torch](#)es, or [Star](#)s. Additionally, anything actually on fire, such as [Plants](#) or [Flammable Objects](#), will give off light as long as they are burning.

Light serves several purposes: mainly it is used to see at night, though it is also needed to prevent [Night Monster](#) from attacking. Additionally, light prevents the large [Sanity](#) loss from being in total darkness (however, it does not prevent the gradual loss caused by Dusk/Night time). If Sanity does drop too low, [Night Hand](#)s will begin to approach the fire and extinguish portions of it; eventually they may put it out completely. These hands can be scared off by stepping on them and running them towards the edge of the fire's light.

### Cooking
[Main|Cooking]  
Fire Pits, Campfires, or Stars can be used to cook foods. [Cooking](#) has various positive effects. For most foods, the amount of Hunger they restore is increased and a small Health boost is added. Eating raw [Meats](#) decreases Sanity, while cooked meats do not. Additionally, [Monster Meat], eaten raw, will reduce Health and Sanity, but these effects are lessened with cooking.

### Warmth
[Main|Freezing]  
In Winter, characters will begin to freeze if they are away from fire for too long (warm clothing helps prevent this). As long as the character is within a certain radius of a fire, they will stay warm. This includes any burning objects like trees. Fires can also warm [Thermal Stone](#)s, which can be carried around to slow down freezing.

### Fire Damage
Objects, items, and Mobs that are on fire can cause 8-12 [hp] damage per second if they are too close to the player. Most mobs will also take fire damage, when on fire, or when they are close to open fires, which can be used as an offensive tactic.
