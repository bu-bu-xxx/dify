'''Woodie''' is the sixth playable [[Character]] unlocked via [[Experience]] in ''[[Don't Starve]]'', with 1600 XP. He is also one of the playable [[Character]]s in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' (DST). He is a stereotypical Canadian lumberjack with a love for chopping [[Trees]] and a mysterious curse.

The other Survivors are not quite sure whether Woodie is simply mad, or if there might be something else to the seemingly inanimate object. Sometimes they swear they can hear a jovial female voice speaking to Woodie when no one else is around...''

In the animated short ''[[Animated shorts and trailers#Tree's A Crowd|Tree's A Crowd]]'', his DST exclusive forms Weremoose and Weregoose are given the spotlight. The short is officially summarized in the Compendium:

''As the power of the moon has grown, so too have the effects of Woodie's curse. Woodie soon found that his form would shift into not only the Werebeaver, but a Weremoose and Weregoose as well. As his changing forms became more unpredictable, Woodie resolved to find a way to have more control over his curse. Using every bit of knowledge he'd gained from his time in the Constant (and some additional tips from Ms. Wickerbottom) he soon discovered that his transformations could in fact be
