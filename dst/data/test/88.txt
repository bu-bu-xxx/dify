# Ruins

A relic of an ancient civilization long dead from the ravages of time. - Wickerbottom

The Ruins are the last remnants of a forgotten civilization located on a level below Caves. They are generated as a new world upon entering them, just like Caves. The Ruins have their own theme, terrain, and biomes. Various unique creatures, plants, and other objects reside within.

## Entrance

The entrance to the Ruins are in the Caves. Each Cave connects to a different Ruins world. Similar to Sinkhole Rocks, they resemble a pile of Thulecite, which is found in the Ruins itself. It is tinted orange, with similar characteristics of the Sinkhole when being mined.

The pile of Thulecite is usually guarded by Spilagmites and Cave Spiders or a Rabbit Hutch village and it can spawn at a random place at any biome most likely at Stalagmite Terrain biome or sunken forest biome.

## Exploration

The Ruins have six different Biomes: Abyss, Labyrinth, Military, Sacred, Village, and Wilds. The Ruins can only be entered through a plugged Sinkhole found in the Caves. Upon mining the Thulecite plug, a rope will lead down to the Ruins through the Sinkhole, and Batilisks will be able to spawn from it into the Caves.

The initial starting area of the Ruins is surrounded by four massive pillars and four Broken Clockworks, with a rope leading up to the Caves. The Ruins are completely dark, causing a steady drain on Sanity. Unlike the caves, the ruins are considered to be in a state of perpetual night, since creatures and plants will act accordingly. As the Ruins are explored, sections of the map will show new icons and terrain specific to the Ruins.

Earthquakes will occur in the Ruins, dropping the same minerals as in the Caves. Although time continues to pass on the surface world, there is no indication of this while underground.

## Nightmare Cycle

The Ruins exist in a state of flux called the Nightmare Cycle, which can be measured by the Thulecite Medallion. As the magical state becomes more intense, the likelihood of earthquakes increases. Its current state will affect the state of objects within it. Nightmare Lights will begin to open up, Runic Turf will glow red, and Ancient Statues will have a horrified look with Nightmare Fuel leaking from their mouths and eyes. Shadow Creatures can attack the player regardless of their sanity level during the most intense stage. This is a great way to collect Nightmare Fuel, but is a bit overwhelming at an early stage in the game. The runes on the ground do not provide a light source despite glowing brightly.

## Creatures

## Features

Some of the ground and pillars in the Ruins are made out of a special material that starts to glow when light is shined upon it during the Nightmare Phase. The Military and Sacred biomes are mostly covered in this material. Also somewhere in the ruins there's a labyrinth, filled with Dangling Depth Dwellers, Ornate Chests and dead ends. At the center of this labyrinth resides the Ancient Guardian, who most players will challenge to get its rare Horn.

Unlike Caves, surface plants like Evergreens, Saplings, Berry Bushes, Spiky Bushes, and Flowers are not found in the Ruins, although the player can still plant these items. Plants will regenerate after a few days of being harvested (except for trees). The only plants that can be found naturally in the ruins are Light Flowers, Cave Banana Trees, and Ferns. Lichen is also exclusive to the ruins. Blue Mushrooms can be found here as well, usually in copious amounts.

Objects found in the Ruins include Relics, Ancient Statues, Nightmare Lights and the Ancient Pseudoscience Station. Relics can be attacked and destroyed for various loot while Ancient Statues can be mined to yield Thulecite and various Gems. Nightmare Lights can emit
