A **Sinkhole** is the entrance to a [[Cave]] and can be found randomly in the world. Each Sinkhole leads to a new Cave or Ruin. The cave-side of a sinkhole is a staircase or cave-exit.

When first discovered, the Sinkhole will be a Plugged Sinkhole and is covered with a jagged rubble mound; Player can usually tell they are close to a Plugged Sinkhole on the surface when they find Rocks lying about in the Biomes for no reason. Mining the Plug reveals the hole with a rope going down into its depths while providing [[Flint]] and [[Rock]]s on the surface and [[Thulecite]], as well as [[Thulecite Fragments]] underground. It takes six hits from a [[Pickaxe]] to unplug it. Once unplugged, up to 6 [[Batilisk]]s will spawn quickly from the Sinkhole at dusk and return underground in the morning. If Batilisks are killed, they will respawn at a rate of 1 per minute until the maximum of 6 has been reached.

There are only three Sinkholes in a surface world and one for each Cave. Plugged and open Sinkholes are marked on a [[map]] by a gray mound and a hole with a red arrow pointing downwards, respectively.

On default settings, the three surface Sinkholes are guaranteed to spawn in the following locations:
* A [[Mosaic]] biome.
* A [[Pig Village]] (generally, this village also has a [[Pig King]]).
* The [[Forest]] biome found in the center of the world's [[Marsh]].
The number of sinkholes in the [[Sandbox Mode|world settings]] can only be "Default" and "None".

Thulecite Sinkholes are usually found on [[Stalagmite Terrain]].
