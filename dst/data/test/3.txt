# WX-78

## Origin

WX-78's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled [[Animated Shorts and Trailers#Disconnected|Disconnected]].

An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [[Compendium]]:

''WX-78 was the result of an unorthodox experiment helmed by {[LoadEmpathyModLibraryExW()......ERROR_DATA_PATH_NOT_FOUND]} and Robert Wagstaff. The experiment turned out to be a [RESOUNDING SUCCESS], but Wagstaff was [A SHORT SIGHTED FOOL, AFRAID OF PROGRESS] and decided to put a stop to further tests. Adamant that the process that created them could still be perfected, WX refused to give up, continuing their experiments in secret. When Wagstaff discovered what they had been doing, there was a heated argument and01110100 01101111 01101111 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101 00100000 01110100 01101111 01101111 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101 00100000 01110100 01101111 01101111 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101''

## Tips

- WX-78 acts like a [[Lightning Rod]]. If any event launches multiple lightning strikes, such as reading [[The End is Nigh]], '''all''' strikes will usually target WX-78.
- Equipping an [[Umbrella]] alongside a hat that offers at least 10% rain protection (such as the [[Straw Hat]]) will completely shield WX-78 from Rain, preventing any damage from being taken.
- WX-78 players may want to avoid using items that offer Lightning immunity (such as the Umbrella or [[Eyebrella]]) if they require healing, though they will take a hit to their Sanity with each strike.
- Using the [[Ice Cube]] or [[Fashion Melon]] as protection from [[Overheating]] is not advised, as the Wetness gained from those items will damage WX-78.
- WX-78's gear consumption ability & light-providing circuits makes them one of the better equipped characters for traversing the [[Ruins]].
- Since they ignore spoilage and food loses all sanity restoration as soon as it turns stale, WX-78 players have at least double the time to utilize foods that grant high sanity but spoil quickly, giving them a distinct advantage over other characters in terms of sanity management.
- In DST, WX-78's [[Don't Starve Together#Favorite Food|favorite food]] is [[Butter Muffin]], meaning that they gain 15 bonus {{Hunger}} when consuming the food.

## Trivia

### In-Game

- WX-78's voice is played by what is explained as a "crazy processed synth".
- WX-78 has a [[Unimplemented Features#Player Skulls|Skull]] in the game files. Also, when struck by Lightning, a skeleton can be seen.
- WX-78 makes a unique creaking noise as they walk.
- Although they take damage from Wetness, WX-78 can eat watery foods such as [[Pomegranate]]s, [[Meaty Stew]], or even [[Watermelon]]s without being harmed.
- WX-78 is one of the original four Characters that were available during the closed Beta of DST.
- In DST, if the player communicates to others with the Y or U keys as WX-78, all messages will be sent in uppercase letters like their original dialogue.
- Most of their audio files are labelled Woodrow, which may indicate they were originally meant for an [[Unimplemented Characters|unimplemented character]] who also has their own audio files in the code. That, or Woodrow was an early iteration of their character.
- WX-78 is oddly inconsistent with their punctuation in quotes. For instance, they often leave the end of their sentences without a period.
- When WX-78 examines a [[Slurper]], they will say "IT VIOLATED MY SMELLING MODULE", but when they examine a [[Durian]], they will say "GOOD THING I LACK A NOSE". This inconsistency may be intentional for comedic effect or just an error.
- WX-78 was originally planned to speak in randomly generated binary.<ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/6745-wx78-the-autom
