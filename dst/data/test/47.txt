# Chess Pieces

## Overview
Chess Pieces are craftable objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. There are eight different variants that can be crafted at a **Potter's Wheel** and are mostly meant for decoration. Nearly all of them are unlocked by giving their respective **Sketch** to the Potter's Wheel, except for the Bubble Pipe Carving and the Carved Hornucopia, which are always available. Players are able to sculpt Chess Pieces out of two **Rocks** and one **Marble**, **Cut Stone** or **Moon Shard**. The chosen material determining the color of the crafted Chess Piece.

Chess Pieces can be carried by players in the chest slot, similar to **Suspicious Marble**, slowing down their movement speed and preventing them from several inventory actions, such as equipping a handheld item.

## Variants

### Carved Hornucopia
- A sculpture for a starving artist.
- Sculpture depicts a **Cornucopia**, a horn of plenty which can be depicted as a horn-shaped, hollow bread filled with food. The shape of the horn resembles a **Beefalo Horn**. The sculpture may be a reference to the fact that a Cornucopia is an over-used example of pottery.

### Bubble Pipe Carving
- Stick this on your wheel and sculpt it.
- The sculpture depicts a **Bubble Pipe** which is a toy that acts similarly to a bubble-blowing stick, except it's shaped like a tobacco pipe. The sculpture is possibly a reference to **Markus Raetz**'s pipe sculpture which can be interpreted as either a tobacco pipe or a shapeless metal blob.

### Anchor Figure
- Ground your base with a stone anchor.
- The sculpture depicts an anchor using to stop the boat. Its Sketch can be crafted in **Seafaring Filter** at **Think Tank**.

### Queenly Figure

### Kingly Figure
