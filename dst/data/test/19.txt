## Overview

Wormwood is one of three Characters introduced in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. He appears to be an animate plant, akin to Treeguards, though he has a green cut stone on the front of his chest. Wormwood is friendly while a little eccentric, addressing things such as insects as "Bzzters" and birds as "Tweeters."

On June 6, 2019, Wormwood was added to Don't Starve Together as the second DLC character after Wortox. He is available to Hamlet owners on Steam for free. For all other players, Wormwood can be purchased either through the Wormwood Chest, which includes his Roseate skin set, or through the Wormwood Deluxe Chest, which includes the Roseate, Oasis Bound and Hollow skin sets. He can alternatively be woven with 2,700 Spools.

Wormwood has many unique abilities pertaining to Plants and plant-like Mobs, and he has access to unique crafting recipes that can help with healing and defense. He is able to plant Seeds without the use of a Farm, and he is treated neutrally by Mobs such as the Lureplant and Snaptooth Flytrap. He also seems to have some sort of kinship with plants, addressing most of them as "Friend," or things similar. Because of this, he loses Sanity when plants around him die, and he gains Sanity when he himself plants them.

Wormwood loses Sanity when plants within a five-tile radius are destroyed, even if the damage is not caused by him. Sanity effects from planting or destroying plants is reduced the further it happens from Wormwood.

## Origin

Wormwood's creation is shown in the animated short Lunar Roots. A green gem fell from the moon, landing on an ancient stone monument in the middle of overgrown rubble. Over a long period of time, a vine encircled the gem and eventually formed a humanoid figure sitting on the monument. The figure, Wormwood, opened his eyes and looked at his hands. He admired the tropical scenery, mimicking the flapping wings of the Butterflies with his leaf fingers. Trying to fit in, he imitated Parrots and Pogs, but he scared them off. Feeling downtrodden, he sat at the base of the monument and tucked himself under a nearby vine. He gave it a pat and smiled to himself. He went to sleep and bloomed along with the nearby plants while under the full moon.
