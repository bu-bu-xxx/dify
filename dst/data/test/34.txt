**Dense Turf** is a craftable **Turf** **Item** introduced in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as **Fire#Fuel**.

Dense Turf allows **Nettle Vine**s to grow and is also visually identical to the turfs found in the **Deep Rainforest** Biome. However, unlike the Deep Rainforest Turf, Dense Turf doesn't have randomly spawned jungle floor ferns that obstruct structure placement, shadows of leaves projected on the ground, a foliage effect on the sides of the screen, and it can be dug up with a **Pitchfork**.

**Grass Tuft**s planted on Dense Turf will grow into **Tall Grass** instead of normal one. Additionally, this turf allows **Cocooned Tree**s to convert regular **Rainforest Tree**s into cocooned ones.

When placed on the **Surface World** and covering a large enough area, no **Birds** will spawn and land on these turfs. In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, this Turf will not spawn **Flooding|Puddles**. Tides and expanding Puddles can still flood this turf, however.

## Trivia
- Dense Turf was added in the March 18, 2019 update.
- The fact that this soil is made with ash, and that when planting plants, they grow even higher level, can be a reference to the [terra preta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta) a soil made by the Brazilian natives with carbon ashes and organic waste that converted soils with poor mineral contents (jungle terrain) into farmland.
