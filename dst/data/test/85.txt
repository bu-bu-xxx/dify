The **Crocommander** is a hostile mob in **The Forge** event exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, and is the second enemy to be encountered. They appear to be bipedal crocodiles with spiked, purple armor.

Like all The Forge mobs, the Crocommander's drops are dependant on what round it is, as well as what items have already been dropped.

### Behavior

Like all mobs in The Forge, Crocommanders spawn from the three [[Forge Portal]]s around the arena. Crocommanders have two attacks: They can bite players who are nearby or they can shoot a blob of green liquid for a ranged attack, which cannot be dodged, making them the only ranged mob in The Forge, other than the [[Grand Forge Boarrior]]. In Round 10, Crocommanders may be problematic to the kiter if they are allowed to aggro on them because the long-distance spit will be a hazard kiting not only them, but the [[Boarilla]] as well; a hit may let the Boarilla get off a free punch. Crocommanders, when summoned, will be spawned with 3 Pit Pigs in Rounds 5 and 6, and 2 Pit Pigs in Round 10; these Pit Pigs will defend the Crocommander against the player who has the aggro of the Crocommander. If the player who has aggro on the Crocommander is at a far enough distance, more so for the Crocommander to use his range spit attack, the Crocommander typically tends to pursuit the player until aggro is automatically given to a different player.
