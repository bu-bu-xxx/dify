## Fighting Strategy
To fight Swordfish, a boat speed of 7 or above is recommended. Sailing close to the Swordfish will cause it to attack, which can be dodged by sailing in the opposite direction after the Swordfish pauses before the attack. Then players will be able to land 1 to 2 hits with a melee weapon depending on boat speed. Swordfish cannot be stunlocked.

## Usage
### Recipes
1. Dead Swordfish + Cooking = Fish Steak
2. Dead Swordfish + Drying Rack = Jerky
3. Dead Swordfish + Birdcage = Egg
4. Dead Swordfish + Gold Nugget (2) + Twigs (1) = Cutlass Supreme
5. Dead Swordfish = Octopus Chest

## Tips
Once the location of the spawner is found, it can be marked by items that have map markers, like any one of the backpacks, traps, sea traps, or boats as well as a buoy.

## Trivia
There is code in the game files that would allow using alive Swordfish in the Crock Pot, counting as 1 unit of Fish and 0.5 units of Meat. However, there is no method implemented that would make capturing Swordfish alive possible.
