**Bean Bugs** are a **Food** **Item** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. They can be found under **Stone Slabs**. Eating them raw or cooked will restore **Hunger**, but at the cost of **Sanity** loss.

Cooking three Bean Bugs and any **Meats** in the **Crock Pot** makes **Feijoada**.

**Webber** and **Wilba** can eat Bean Bugs without the Sanity Penalty. Wilba will turn into a **Werepig** after eating two Bean Bugs.
