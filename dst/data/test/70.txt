The Sea Weed is a plant-like mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together introduced in Return of Them. They appear in groups of 8 to 15 in the Rough Ocean. There are 3 species of Sea Weed: Pink, Yellow, and White.

Every 2.5 to 3.5 minutes (1 to 2 minutes for Pink Sea Weeds), they release a pollen cloud. The cloud attracts nearby Ocean Fishes similarly to Fish Food. If no other fishes are present, one Spittlefish appears. When killed or caught, the Spittlefish regenerates in 4 minutes (2 minutes for White Sea Weeds).

The base of a Sea Weed grows up to 3 Barnacles. They can be harvested directly or by using a Razor. The Barnacles regrow in 2.5 to 4 days each. Upon harvesting, the Sea Weed and all nearby Sea Weeds wake up and attack the player, unless the player is Wormwood or they used Razor when the Sea Weed is sleeping (like during the night).

Sea Weeds attack by launching projectiles in the air. They do 68 damage to the player. If these projectiles miss, they will instead make a leak in the boat. All nearby Sea Weeds will wake up and attack the player if one is attacked or if a Boat is rammed into them too fast. Sea Weeds will not wake up at night, so it is safe to attack one without the others waking.

Upon death, they drop 2 or 3 Seedshells (3 plus two times a 50% chance for Yellow Sea Weed), unharvested Barnacles, one Sea Sprout Starter and a Sea Stack which can be mined for 2 Rocks.
