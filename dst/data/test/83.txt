# Incomplete Guide to Wigfrid - The Performance Artist

## Background

Wigfrid is a character that combines traits from two other characters, Wolfgang and Woodie, with some modifications. She has a constant damage multiplier of 1.25, which is higher than most characters, and takes less damage from most attacks (0.75). Her stats are 120 hunger, 200 health, and 120 sanity. Killing any hostile/neutral mob results in 25% of its attack damage being converted to her health and sanity.

## Pros & Cons

Wigfrid's primary limitation is her inability to eat non-meat items, which can make the early game challenging. However, she starts with excellent gear, including the Battle Helm and Battle Spear, which provide good damage absorption and combat capabilities. Her combat prowess allows her to gain health and sanity boosts upon killing mobs.

## Strategy #1: Early Game Days (1-20)

In the early days, focus on gathering resources such as wood, setting traps, and mining. Collect berries and carrots for bait in rabbit traps. Burn trees for charcoal and explore to locate resources such as rabbit holes, frog ponds, buzzards, beefalo herds, tallbird clans, pig villages, pig kings, spider dens, and marshes. Set up camp near a marsh or savanna for meat, reeds, and silk. Produce jerky or bacon and eggs to help with hunger management.

## Strategy #2: Utilizing Combat-Based Gain

Wigfrid benefits from killing enemies, so consider targeting Tallbirds, Buzzards, Beefalo, Tentacles, Rabbits, Koalefants, Pigs, and Bosses for health, sanity, and resource gains.

## Suggested Items

- **Ham Bat/Tentacle Spike**: Depending on playstyle, choose between the high-damage Ham Bat or the consistent Tentacle Spike.
- **Bat Bat**: Provides faster, more reliable regeneration due to Wigfrid's damage multiplier.
