# Health

> "For documenting my pain." - Wendy

**Health** is a measurement of overall physical well-being. Unlike **Hunger** (and in many situations **Sanity**), Health typically does not drain over time. Health is lost instantly when a character is hit by an enemy attack, eats harmful food such as **Monster Meat**, eats **Rot**, or harvests from thorny plants like the **Spiky Bush**. In **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** (RoG), Health is lost instantly when harvesting from **Cacti**. Health is lost continually while the character is **burning**, **starving**, or **freezing**. In RoG, characters also lose Health while **overheating** and in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** (SW), while **poisoned**. Losing all Health results in **death** (although not necessarily the loss of the game). Health can be seen on the heart-shaped gauge in the upper-right corner of the screen, which shrivels and empties as the character's Health is depleted. Note that having a **Meat Effigy** lowers max Health. **Wanda** in DST does not have a health meter, instead, she has an age meter. Her meter corresponds approximately to 150 health.

| Willow | 150 |
| Wolfgang | 200 |
| Wendy | 150 |
| WX-78 | 100 |
| Wickerbottom | 150 |
| Woodie | 150 |
| Wes | 113 |
| Maxwell | 75 |
| Wagstaff | 150 |
| Wigfrid | 200 |
| Webber | 175 |
| Walani | 120 |
| Warly | 150 |
| Wilbur | 125 |
| Woodlegs | 150 |
| Wilba | 150 |
| Wormwood | 150 |
| Wheeler | 100 |

* Wolfgang has 200 Health by default (his Health limit rises to 300 with a full belly and drops to 150 when starving). This is not true for **Don't Starve Together** as his health cap is only 200.

* WX-78 begins with 100 Health and is capable of increasing their Health Cap up to 400 by eating **Gears**. WX-78 begins 125 Health in **Don't Starve Together** and is capable of increasing their Health Cap by using **Hardy Circuit** and **Super-Hardy Circuit**s.

* Wilba's werepig form has 350 health.

* Wurt has 250 health when **King of the Merms** is alive.

## Healing

Health can be restored in a few ways. The most basic way to regain health is by eating **Food**, most of which typically provides 1-3 health when consumed. **Cooking** the food often increases the Health 1 or 2 points. There are also a few items whose sole purpose is to heal.

Wormwood is unable to gain health from eating food and must rely on other methods to restore it.

Certain food and items provide a greater health boost and are thus very valuable:

* **Crock Pot**: Several Crock Pot recipes provide substantial healing. **Fishsticks** [+40 hp] are an easy recipe to make. **Pierogi** [+40 hp] is a lot of people's go-to dish for its cheap recipe. **Dragonpie** [+40 hp] is excellent if the player manages to farm **Dragon Fruit**. In Shipwrecked, **Bisque** [+60 Hp] is food that can be easily produced, and is one of the most potent healing items in the game. However, regarding Crock Pot recipes in general, the player must make sure that the individual components (raw or cooked) won't heal more if eaten on their own.

* Cooked Crops: When cooked over a fire, **Eggplants**, **Potatoes**, **Dragon Fruit** and **Pomegranates** heal 20 hp.

* **Jerky**/**Small Jerky**: Jerky and Small Jerky restore 20 Hp and 8 Hp respectively and last for a very long time. If primary concern is health, and the player's only food source is **Meats**, they should be made into jerky. Jerky can be used in a **Crock Pot** as normal meat, if needed.

* **Spider Gland**/**Mosquito Sack**: **Spider
