## Webber

'''Webber''' is one of the two playable [[Characters]] exclusive to the {{Giants|l}} DLC. He's the only one of the two that is not unlocked via [[Experience]]. He's also one of the playable Characters in [[Don't Starve Together|''Don't Starve Together'']]. Webber looks like a humanoid spider, though he's actually a child that was fused with a spider that tried to eat him. He received a character refresh exclusive to DST in June 2021.<ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/129647-dont-starve-together-return-of-them-eye-of-the-storm-now-available/] Posted on May 5, 2021.</ref>

Webber's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled ''[[Animated Shorts and Trailers#Along Came A Spider|Along Came A Spider]]''. An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [[Compendium]]:

''Once upon a time, there was a young boy who lived with his family on a small farmstead. Though they lived humbly, the boy's home was filled with love, and he grew up happy and kind. The boy might have lived contentedly for the rest of his days if not for the sudden arrival of an old aquaintance[sic], who came to the house beseeching the boy's father for his expertise on a strange and secretive project...''
