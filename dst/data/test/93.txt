Some of you may have troubles making sure to get enough **food** to last you through the game, or maybe you can't seem to get the right food. My aim in this guide is to help you ensure that you have sustainable and profitable food sources.

Once you get the hang of collecting food, it isn't too hard to get it, because there is almost always more from where it came from.

Keep in mind this is most RoG (**Reign of Giants** DLC) content, though I will make sure to separate vanilla content from any DLC content to make sure nobody gets mixed up.

This is my third guide, and my other two are always being worked on, it may and will take a while to finalize this one.

## Early Game Food

Before you get a **Science Machine** and **Alchemy Engine**, you don't have as much of a steady food supply. However, there are ways to ensure your early game survival.

When you first spawn, you may want to collect as many **Berries** as possible. You find them on **Berry Bushes**, of course. There are **Carrots**, but only pick those when you need them badly. Unlike the Berries, they are a limited food source without farming, and do not spoil in the ground, so leaving them in the ground until they're completely needed is a good idea. They also make great food when exploring in **Winter**, as berries grow at a much, much slower rate if at all.

Unless you're unlucky, you probably don't need to dig into your **Carrot** supply. In the early game, farming **Rabbits** is one of the best things you can do. **Traps** only cost six **Cut Grass** and two **Twigs**. It is one of the best ways to obtain food, especially early game, trust me. I've gotten over a stack of **Cooked Morsel**s from it before. Make as many Traps as possible, but don't bait them; Place them over the **Rabbit Holes**, so the Rabbits will be caught when leaving or exiting. Sometimes, they won't get caught, but it's better than baiting it. When you bait them, you lose the bait, and your trap amount is restricted to the amount of food you can put in them. It's much more profitable when you just put it over the hole. Collect the Rabbits a bit after dawn and right after they go home for the **Dusk** and **Night**. Make sure not to pick them up right when day hits, as they don't come out as soon as it does. However, they do scurry back home as soon as its dusk. When you collect them at the beginning and end of the day, it makes it possible to go and collect **Twigs**, **Grass**, **Berries**, **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Gold** and anything else you may find, and it gives you more time to explore. Dusk and Dawn are the times the most get caught, and if you reset it after you collect it, you get a lot of food. It is also possible to put down a carrot or berry, and wait until a Rabbit comes over to eat it, and kill them. However, other Rabbits will rush into their holes, making this ineffective unless you are desperate. This also makes you have to stalk it, and it's slow because they're slowly walking, which can get annoying when you should be gathering resources. This also does not catch live Rabbits, which is important because you need to watch your naughtiness. When you cook them alive, it counts as the **Fire** doing the killing and does not effect you badly in any way. If you are playing RoG, the Rabbits will starve to death in the trap or in your **inventory**, so be careful. Rabbits are even useful to farm late game if you can't find other foods or you're uncomfortable with the amount you have.

When picking Berries, there is a chance for a **Gobbler** to spawn. It is a turkey-like creature and you'll know it when you see it. Pick up all **Red Mushrooms** (Or red caps) you see, as when they spawn you can put 3 down and it'll kill the Gobbler, resulting in two **Drumsticks**. Red Caps should only be eaten when starving in early game, due to their -20 health penalty. When cooked, they yield no hunger, so that is not helpful, especially compared to the wonders of **Drumsticks**.

So here are the best early game food sources (Keep in mind that this list will change and grow over time):
* Berries
* Rabbits
* Gobblers

Alright, here are some food sources that require a Science Machine/Alchemy Engine. Some of these can be
