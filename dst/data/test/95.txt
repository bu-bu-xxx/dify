## Description
Mumsy is a [[Mob]] exclusive to the [[The Gorge]] [[:Category:Events|event]] in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' and the first character encountered when entering The Gorge world. She instructs players to start cooking to appease [[The Gnaw]] and gives them 10 Old Coins with which they can purchase cooking items from herself, her son [[Billy]], [[Pipton]], and [[Sammy]]. Players cannot buy from anyone else until interacting with her. She will also inform players of the Gnaw's current craving as well as how the Gnaw liked the food after it was snackrificed.

## Trading
Mumsy sells the following cooking items:

| Item | Old Coin | Result | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cookpot Kit | 6 | Cookpot Kit | "Everything you need to set up a cookpot." |
| Oven Kit | 6 | Oven Kit | "Everything you need to set up an oven." |
| Grill Kit | 6 | Grill Kit | "Everything you need to set up a grill." |
| Silver Plate | 2 Sapphire Medallion | Silver Plate | "High class plating for improved dishes." |
| Silver Bowl | 2 Sapphire Medallion | Silver Bowl | "Presentation is half the taste." |
| Goat Milk | 1 Red Mark | Goat Milk (3) | "Fresh from the source." |
| Ancient Key Gorge | 3 Gnaw's Favor | Ancient Key Gorge | "The way out. I can charge it with Favors." |

Anything bought by [[Wes]] costs one less Old Coin or Sapphire Medallion, except for items bought with Red Marks or Gnaw's Favors. The Favors are required to charge the key instead of buying it.

## Quotes
Note: For Mumsy's Gnaw craving hints, lines from part 1 and part 2 are randomly matched to one another, but a part 2 is only chosen if the part 1 has a space for it. The craving itself changes depending on how much progress the player has made in the round.
