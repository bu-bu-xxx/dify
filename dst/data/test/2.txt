# Krampus

## Behavior

Krampus is a neutral monster that steals the player's stored items and items left on the ground. It appears when players gain too much Naughtiness from killing innocent creatures too fast.

## Naughtiness

Naughtiness is generated by killing certain creatures. Once the player reaches a threshold of naughtiness, Krampus will spawn. After Krampus appears, the naughtiness level is reset to 0.

## Strategy

Krampus, especially when more than one spawns at the same time, can wreak havoc in a player's base without adequate preparation. Players are advised to pay attention to the signs of naughtiness, and only summon Krampus when preparations are complete; away from important items and the player's base.

## Downloadable Content

- In the Reign of Giants DLC, killing Glommer will immediately summon Krampii as it increases naughtiness by 50 points, the exact amount needed to spawn Krampus.
- In the Shipwrecked DLC, Krampus will be wearing a Floral Shirt on his visit to the islands.
- In the Hamlet DLC, Krampus has the ability to enter interiors.

## Tips

- Summoning Krampus at night will summon sleeping Krampii, including during a Full Moon, which allows them to be easily killed.
- Tooth Traps are not very effective against Krampus since there is a chance that he will steal the trap instead of activating it.
- Various forms of "Krampus traps" can be created utilizing their behavior of stealing items.

## Trivia

- Krampus was added in the Naughty and Nice update.
- Krampus is a beast-like creature from the folklore of Alpine countries, thought to punish bad children during the Yule season by whipping them into submission.
