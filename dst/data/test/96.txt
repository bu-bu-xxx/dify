## The Wooden Thing (commonly referred to as the Teleportato, when completed) is a unique Structure in Don't Starve. It spawns naturally in every world in its own Set Piece. It is guarded by 1 Clockwork Rook, 2 Clockwork Knights, and 2 Clockwork Bishops. The area is also surrounded by Evil Flowers and Marble Trees laid on a Chess Biome.

There are two versions of it, one that spawns in Survival Mode and one in Adventure Mode, that differ in their color schemes. In Adventure Mode, the Set Piece in which it spawns also lacks the Clockwork Rook and the fully assembled Teleportato requires a Divining Rod to unlock it (activate). Players can craft a Divining Rod to help them track down the Wooden Thing.

The Teleportato is built by combining the Wooden Thing with the Metal Potato Thing, Box Thing, Ring Thing, and the Crank Thing (in any order). Note that each 'Thing' component will spawn in a different area of the map. A completed Teleportato can then be activated, allowing the player to journey to a newly generated world. Shadow Hands will emerge from the ground to pull the player through to the next world. Using the Teleportato is one-way. Upon traveling to the new world, the previous world is destroyed, and the player cannot return to it.

In Survival Mode, items in the player's inventory will be transferred to the new world (including items in an equipped Backpack). In Adventure Mode, players can only take 4 items through a Teleportato. The Eye Bone and Divining Rod will always turn into Ashes after being carried through a Teleportato. The player retains any unlocked crafting recipes and pre-built structures (by crafting items with the required materials, but not placing them immediately afterward). WX-78 retains any upgraded stats. Beard length is also retained, as long as either Webber or Wilson is selected for the new Character. In Survival Mode, any customization to World Customization will still apply in the new world. Upon arriving in the new world, the player's character will retain their Health, Sanity, and Hunger values from the previous world. However, if they had less than 20% Health, 30% Sanity or 40% Hunger, their respective values will be set to these minimums when entering the new world.

After traveling through a Teleportato, the player will gain Experience based on the number of days survived, and will be given the option to play as a different Character in the next world (except in Adventure Mode).
