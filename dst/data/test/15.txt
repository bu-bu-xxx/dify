The Football Helmet is a wearable Armor, crafted in the Fight tab. It requires 1 Pig Skin and 1 Rope to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

It has a Durability of 450 and absorbs 80% of all physical damage. Not factoring the armor's durability, the Football Helmet effectively increases a player's hp to 750 for the average 150 hp survivor.

The Football Helmet can be given to a Pig or Bunnyman to wear to increase their HP by 450.

The Football Helmet may also be found in an Ornate Chest, which spawns in the Ruins.

## Tips

The Football Helmet is valuable, as it keeps the player protected without losing the Body slot for items such as a Backpack or an Insulated Pack so the player can be more efficient in collecting resources while staying safe. It is recommended to keep at least 1 Football Helmet with you just in case of a potential ambush.

## Trivia

- The Football Helmet was added in the The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You update.
- In American football, the football was once made out of animal leather and called a "pigskin".
