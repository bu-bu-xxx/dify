# Ice Cube

The Ice Cube is a craftable Dress Item from the Reign of Giants DLC. It requires 2 Electrical Doodads, 4 Rope, and 10 Ice to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

## Description
Science, on the rocks.

## Perks
- Prevents overheating in Summer or Dry Season.
- Increases wetness over time.
- Walking speed reduced by 10%.

## Crafting Recipe
- Ingredient 1: Electrical Doodad (x2)
- Ingredient 2: Rope (x4)
- Ingredient 3: Ice (x10)

## Tips
- Placing an Ice Cube in the Ice Box will completely stop it from melting.
- The Ice Cube is good addition to the Thermal Stone near the Endothermic Fire Pit and/or in the Ice Box for long trips during Summer.
- The Ice Cube will make inventory and equipped items Wet, causing Sanity loss. This can be used to become insane for farming Nightmare Fuel.
- Even with maximum wetness, Maxwell will not lose any sanity, making this hat rather valuable for him during summer. That being said, the faster food spoilage and slippery weapons are still large downsides to using the Ice Cube for extended periods of time.
- Dress Items with Wetness resistance, such as the Rain Coat, do not reduce wetness from the Ice Cube.
- While wearing the Ice Cube, being near a fire will slowly get rid of player wetness and will prevent the player and the player's items from becoming wet.
- It costs less Ice overall to just build a new Ice Cube than refueling an existing one with Ice, since the latter gives 0.8 days of durability per Ice instead of 0.4.
- Storing important items in the Piggyback will prevent them from becoming wet.
- Wurt does not lose sanity from the Ice Cube's Wetness.

## Trivia
- The description "Science, on the rocks." refers to the bartending terminology "On the rocks" for a drink served over ice cubes.
