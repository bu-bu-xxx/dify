## Scrapbook Info
This needs some fertilizing after planting. | Banana Bushes (Item)

## Description
Banana Bushes are Plants exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in The Curse of Moon Quay update. They can be found growing on Moon Quay and are dropped in their item form from the Unnatural Portal.

A Banana Bush will grow 1 Banana at a time after several growing stages. Similar to Berry Bushes, it can be replanted when dug up with a Shovel but will need to be fertilized before it will start growing new fruit. The bush will need to be re-fertilized after multiple harvests.

## Bugs
Despite having the MakeNoGrowInWinter() component, Banana Bushes will continue to grow during Winter.
