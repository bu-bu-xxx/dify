# Crafting

Crafting is an in-game mechanic that allows players to craft or make **Items** and **Structures**. This is done by selecting an item or structure to be crafted in one of the 19 **Crafting Tabs** (including **DLC**s, and **Character-Specific** tabs). Provided the player has sufficient materials in their inventory and, if necessary, has **unlocked** the item recipe, they will receive 1 or more of the crafted item. Below are the crafting tables for the different game modes available. The availability of crafting recipes are further affected by game version, the player's world (Game Mode), special **Events**, etc.

## Unlocked

Unlocking for the first time will grant the player 15 **Sanity**. Once unlocked, items can be crafted any time.

### Prototype

Generally, each Item or Structure must be **"prototyped"** at a particular **Prototyper** or through other means to be unlocked. Once the item has been unlocked, it can be crafted anywhere, anytime (so long as the required materials are available). Tier 1 items can be unlocked at either a **Science Machine** or **Alchemy Engine**. Tier 2 items can only be unlocked at an Alchemy Engine, ETC.

*Some recipes require the player in a specified world to be available. (Removed in Hamlet version)
**Some recipes require the player to be in a specified world to Prototypeable. (Add in Hamlet version)

Standing near the Prototyper allows prototyping new recipes. The following is a list of all the Prototypers:

## Crafting Station

Crafting Station is similar to Prototyper, except that they do not unlock the recipe for the player after they make it, so the player must return to Crafting Station if they want to make the item again. In the **Hamlet** DLC, the interior areas of **Slanty Shanty** can be considered to be a hidden Crafting Station. The Key to the City can be carried in the inventory, making it movable unlike other Crafting Stations.

The following is a list of all the Crafting Station:

| ![Ancient Pseudoscience Station](Ancient Pseudoscience Station.png) | [Ancient Pseudoscience Station] |

| ![Key to the City](Key_to_the_City.png) | [Key to the City] |
