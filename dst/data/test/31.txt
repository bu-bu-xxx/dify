The Mad Scientist Lab is a craftable Structure introduced in the 2018 version of the event. It is found in the Prototypers & Stations Filter and Structures Filter and requires two Electrical Doodads and two Cut Stones to craft. It is always available to craft and does not require prototyping.

Standing next to the Mad Scientist Lab grants players access to the Mad Science Filter where they can conduct several experiments to produce potions. Each of these experiments causes the player to lose a certain amount of their Sanity.

Most of these experiments have several possible outcomes, however, they are all of positive effect for the players. As the cooking process takes a certain amount of time, their results are not immediately available for usage.
