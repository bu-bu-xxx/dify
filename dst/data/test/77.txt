Wolfgang is the second playable [[character|Character]] in ''[[Don't Starve]]'' that can be unlocked via [[Experience]], with 320 XP, and one of the playable Characters in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' ({{Pic24|Don't Starve Together icon}}).

### Trivia

  - Wolfgang's voice is played by a tuba, which changes in pitch depending on his current form.
- Lore
  - Wolfgang was a strongman working in a circus.
  - It is implied that Wolfgang was also in a military.

### Cultural References
