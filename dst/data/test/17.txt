## Console
Console is a developer interface in **Don't Starve** and **Don't Starve Together**. Players can open a console menu by pressing **~** (English/French), **^** or **ö** (German Keyboard Layout) **æ** or **ø** (Scandinavian Keyboard) or **ù** (Azerty Keyboard Layout) and "Ñ" in the Spanish Keyboard. It can be hidden again by pressing **Ctrl + L**. However, the feature must be enabled in the settings file located at the following location:

- **Windows, Mac:** `<Documents>\Klei\DoNotstarve\settings.ini`
- **Linux:** `~/.klei/DoNotStarve/settings.ini`

Opening settings.ini, players should make the following changes:

```ini
[MISC]
ENABLECONSOLE = true
```

If a player wishes to disable the console once it has been enabled, they will have to navigate to `\dont_starve\data\scripts\main.lua` and set the "CONSOLE_ENABLED" line to false.

### Trivia
- The Console is not available in **The Forge** event servers for **Don't Starve Together**. Also, none of its exclusive prefabs can be used in a regular world, making anything exclusive to **The Forge** impossible to spawn.
