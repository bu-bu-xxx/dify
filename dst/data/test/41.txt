# Crafting

Crafting is an in-game mechanic that allows players to craft or make Items and Structures. This is done by selecting an item or structure to be crafted in one of the 19 Crafting Tabs (including DLCs, and Character-Specific tabs). Provided the player has sufficient materials in their inventory and, if necessary, has unlocked the item recipe, they will receive 1 or more of the crafted item. Below are the crafting tables for the different game modes available. The availability of crafting recipes are further affected by special Events.

## Unlocked

Unlocking for the first time will grant the player 15 Sanity. Once unlocked, items can be crafted any time.

### Prototype

Generally, each Item or Structure must be "prototyped" at a particular Prototyper or through other means to be unlocked. Once the item has been unlocked, it can be crafted anywhere, anytime (so long as the required materials are available). Tier 1 items can be unlocked at either a Science Machine or Alchemy Engine. Tier 2 items can only be unlocked at an Alchemy Engine, ETC.

Standing near the Prototyper allows prototyping new recipes. The following is a list of all the Prototypers:

- Science Machine
- Alchemy Engine
- Prestihatitator
- Shadow Manipulator
- Bookcase
- Think Tank
- Tackle Receptacle
- Terra Firma Tamper
- Sawhorse

## Crafting Station

Crafting Station is similar to Prototyper, except that they do not unlock the recipe for the player after they make it, so the player must return to Crafting Station if they want to make the item again.

- Cartographer's Desk
- Potter's Wheel
- Rock Den
- Celestial Orb

## Don't Starve Together Quick-Craft Tabs

In Don't Starve Together, the crafting sidebar UI has been redesigned into Quick-Craft Tabs which allow the player to quickly craft items and structures. The player can use up to 9 pages of quick-craft tabs, with each page holding up to 9 recipes maximum. Keybinds can be set to quickly page left and right between pages. Moreover, mouse-wheeling over a particular tab changes the Belongings skin of that item or structure.

## Craftable Items and Structures

## Tips

* Whenever an item is unlocked, the player's Sanity will be restored by 15 points. This is only when prototyping the item and not during subsequent construction of that item. Therefore, a very simple tactic for healing sanity is to hold off on prototyping new items until needing the sanity.

## Trivia

* Prior to the "Hungry for your Hunger" update, the Shadow Manipulator functioned as a "level 3" crafting station. It could research all the same items as the Alchemy Engine and Science Machine before the science and magic crafting trees were separated.
* In the early beta of Don't Starve, the game used a "Research points" system instead of prototyping
