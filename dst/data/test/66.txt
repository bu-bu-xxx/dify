## Description
The Bird Trap is a Survival Item used to catch Birds. It can be crafted using 3 Twigs and 4 Silk, and requires a Science Machine to prototype. Bird Traps can be baited with Seeds to significantly increase the chance of catching a Bird, though it is not a requirement. Using a Feather Hat will increase the number of birds landing to speed up the process.

## Trivia
- Following the "Naughty and Nice" update, Feathers and Morsels can no longer be acquired directly using the Trap. Instead, murdering the Bird while it's in the Inventory is now necessary.
- In the old science system, the Bird Trap used to cost 30 Research Points to craft.

## Bugs
- Sometimes Birds will glitch out of Traps after being caught.
- If the Bird Trap is picked up right as it catches a Bird, the Bird may disappear.
- Sometimes the Trap will turn invisible, but will still be shown on the map. The player can press space when near it to get it back.
- In the "Shipwrecked" DLC, putting a Seed retrieved from the Ocean inside the Bird Trap may make it look like it's still in the Ocean. Picking up the Bird Trap may cause the Seed to disappear.
