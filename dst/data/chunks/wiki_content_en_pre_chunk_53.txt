Meadow Turf is one of the Turf Items exclusive to the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC, acquired by digging Meadow tiles with a Pitchfork. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as Fire#Fuel fuel.

Plants like Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Lureplants, Bamboo Roots, Viney Bush Roots, and Jungle Tree Seeds can be planted on these Turfs. It will not stop the Lureplants' Eyeplants from spawning.

Flooding can start on it.

When placed on the Surface World in a large enough area, Toucans are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs. During Hurricane Season, there are no birds that spawn and land on these turfs.

## Description

Figkabab is a Meat Food item exclusive to Don't Starve Together and introduced in the Waterlogged update. It is made by combining a Fig, 1.0 Meat, and a Twig in the Crock Pot. The recipe does not exclude more twigs or other inedibles. Adding more than 1 monster food will result in Wet Goop. Due to its high priority, most other meat combinations will result in Figkabob nevertheless, overtaking Fishsticks and Leafy Meatloaf. Using a Koalefant Trunk will create a Fig-Stuffed Trunk.

It shares similar stats and characteristics to other skewered dishes in the game such as Kabobs and Fancy Spiraled Tubers. Consuming it will increase the player's body temperature by 1 degree per second in 15 seconds. Unlike kabobs, the recipe requires at least 1.0 worth of meat items. While the dish is not efficient in terms of hunger, it effectively grants the same stats as a large jerky from any meat item, including leafy and monster meat which would not normally be eligible for drying racks. It cannot be consumed by Wurt. All the ingredients needed to make it can be found in the Waterlogged biome, as figs can be collected from the Great Tree Vines and Striders around the Vines will often drop monster meat.

## Recipe

### Cookbook Recipe

| Item | Quantity |
|------|----------|
| Figs | x1       |
| Twigs | x1       |
| Meats | x1.0     |
| Filler | x1     |

**Note:** Cannot put more than 1.0 Monster Food.

### Crock Pot Examples

| Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Result   |

## Trivia

- This is the fifth skewered dish in Don't Starve Together after Kabobs, Melonsicles, Banana Pops, and Fancy Spiraled Tubers.
- Its name is a portmanteau of Fig and Kebab, the latter being the umbrella term for many meat-based dishes originating from the Middle East and the surrounding area. The dish is specifically

The Naked Mole Bat is a mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together. They spawn when a player approaches one of the large lights shining from above into the Lunar Grotto biome. They are aggressive towards the player. When killed, they will respawn from the same light after 4 days.

They attack all other small creatures. The only monsters they don't attack naturally are Batilisks and other Naked Mole Bats. When attacking, they bite their target with their sharp teeth. Before attacking, they sometimes screech.

When finding food, they move towards the food item and eat it with their nose by sniffing it. They are omnivore and eat both meats and vegetables/fruits.

Upon death, they drop either 1 Monster Meat (66%) or 1 Naked Nostrils (33%), and possibly Guano (15%).

After some time they will go to sleep and create a Naked Mole Bat Burrow.

## Hunting

- When in combat, Naked Mole Bats have a chance to summon another Mole Bat from the ceiling by screaming upwards if there isn't another mole bat near.
- Bunnymen and Pigs attack them on sight as they are considered Monsters. Pigs only leave their houses underground when exposed to light during the day, so it's advised to build Rabbit Hutches near Cave Lights, where they spawn.
- Batilisks will aid Naked Mole Bats in battle. If a Naked Mole Bat is attacked, nearby Mole Bats and Batilisks will join the fight. When a Batilisk is attacked, nearby Mole Bats will join the fight as well.
- They take 2 shots from an Ice Staff to be frozen and 3 Sleep Darts to be put to sleep.

## Trivia

- The Naked Mole Bat was introduced in the Return of Them update.
- Its name is a pun of the name for Naked Mole Rats.

# Books

Books are Wickerbottom's special ability. She can make many different kinds of books, each with its own special power. Each book has multiple uses but will always affect sanity.

## Birds of the World
The **Birds of the World** is one of the first books made by Wickerbottom. It can summon 20 to 30 birds and has a max of 3 uses and drains 50 sanity. Allowing you to summon up to 90 birds, as you might imagine, it can be used in a variety of ways to get an advantage, such as hunting them or capturing them. This book also works very well in combination with the **Pan Flute** or **Sleepytime Stories** as they can be used to put all the birds to sleep allowing you to easily capture them and create a large bird farm or slaughter them for a huge amount of meat and feathers.

Since birds are considered innocent creatures, killing a bird adds points to the player's **naughtiness** level: a **Red Bird** or **Snowbird** adds two, a **Crow** adds one point. This can cause **Krampus** to appear, which could be quite handy if you are attempting to acquire a **Krampus Sack** since you can kill many birds in a small time period. Otherwise, the player should avoid killing too many of the summoned birds.

**Recipe**
- Item 1: Papyrus
- Item 2: Papyrus
- Item 3: Egg
- Item 4: Egg
- Result: Birds of the World

## Applied Horticulture
This book allows the reader to grow **Crops**, **Plants**, and advance **Trees** another step in their life cycle instantly in all seasons except winter. It should be noted that reading it will not cause newly planted **Pine Cones** to instantly grow into trees, but rather cause current trees to grow into bigger forms. During **Winter**, it will only work on trees, not on unfertilized crops or plants. This is very useful for starting or expanding **Farms**. It has 5 uses and 30 range, and costs 33 sanity to use.

**Recipe**
- Item 1: Papyrus
- Item 2: Papyrus
- Item 3: Seeds
- Item 4: Manure
- Result: Applied Horticulture

## Sleepytime Stories
Cause animals to sleep. It has 5 uses and 30 range with a sanity drain of 33. Mobs will be put into a deeper sleep than usual, allowing the player to move closer to them without waking them up, for example the **Tallbird**. It's also useful for shaving **Beefalo** and fighting off the occasional waves of **Hounds**.

If a mob that is put to sleep is attacked, all of the nearby mobs will wake up after a couple of seconds. Mobs sometimes sleep all day after they have been put to sleep. This is very similar to the **Pan Flute** as they both have the same power, but while the flute lasts longer and has a shorter casting time, it is ultimately non-renewable.

**Recipe**
- Item 1: Papyrus
- Item 2: Papyrus
- Item 3: Nightmare Fuel
- Item 4: Nightmare Fuel
- Result: Sleepytime Stories

## The End is Nigh!
This book's power is to cause 16 consecutive **Lightning** strikes in a large ring around Wickerbottom. It has 5 uses and 3 to 15 range, draining sanity by 33 per use. It goes without saying that this book was built for battle as it's the most powerful weapon in Wickerbottom's arsenal. It calls down lightning which, in addition to doing damage, also lights enemies on fire, causing them to panic. Caution should be used, however, as the book can easily cause fires, and its effects are completely nullified around **Lightning Rods**. The rain caused by using the book can also increase the sanity toll caused by the book. As such, it is probably wise to obtain an **Umbrella** before using this book.

In Reign of Giants & Shipwrecked DLCs, The lightning from **The End is Nigh!** can strike Wickerbottom. It is advised to use clothing that provides lightning protection, such as an **Eyebrella** or **Rain Coat** (RoG), or a **Dumbrella** or **Snakeskin Jacket** (SW).

In Don't Starve Together, this book can be used to trigger a **WX-78**'s system overload power multiple times.

**Recipe**
- Item 1: Papyrus
- Item 2: Papyrus
- Item 3: Red Gem
- Result: The End is Nigh

  - [[pic24|Spark Ark]] ([[pic24|Grainy Transmission]])

## Quotes

- **Wilson:** What big, glowing eyes you have!
- **Willow:** Don't worry, you're still gonna go down in flames.
- **Wolfgang:** Good monster doggy. Don't kill Wolfgang.
- **Wendy:** It only lives for malice.
- **WX-78:** IT HAS RECEIVED A FIRMWARE UPDATE
- **Wickerbottom:** Its body has been drastically altered.
- **Woodie:** You are one strange lookin' pooch.
- **Maxwell:** I don't care for the new look.
- **Wigfrid:** It is pössessed by angry spirits!
- **Webber:** That's not a nice puppy!
- **Winona:** Whose yard did you get out of?
- **Warly:** Its temper hasn't improved one bit.
- **Wortox:** This Rover has had quite the makeover!
- **Wormwood:** Weird Woofer
- **Wurt:** Spikey doggy.
- **Walter:** That Varg doesn't look so good...
- **Wanda:** Oh botheration, I'm getting deja vu...

## Behavior

### Attack Pattern

- The Possessed Varg periodically howls to summon two Hounds at a time; however, after their death, the summoned Hounds turn into Horror Hounds.
- The Possessed Varg has the same bite as the Varg, and also uses a new attack - it breathes cold flames in an area, turning from side to side and dealing damage several times to players caught within.
- This same attack is also a weakness of the Possessed Varg — if the Varg receives damage from a [[Damage#Weapons_with_Planar_Damage|Planar Damage weapon]] during its cold breath attack, it can be stunned for a short period of time, during which players can deal damage to the Varg or deal with its Hounds.

## Tips

- **Woodie:** With the Weremoose Mastery Insight unlocked, can very easily kill the Varg and Possessed Varg by continuously holding the attack button and tanking the damage, only taking about 3/5ths his own health in damage.

## Trivia

- The [[Gingerbread Varg]] can also transform into a Possessed Varg when killed, but the [[Clay Varg]] cannot as its body shatters when killed.
- The Possessed Varg was introduced in the ''Host of Horrors'' [[From Beyond]] update.
- It is the only lunar-mutated boss whose predecessor is a non-boss [[monster]], as the Varg lacks the "Epic" tag.
- As such, the [[Eye of Terror|Twins of Terror]] is naturally hostile to the Possessed Varg, making it a viable tactic to trick the bosses into fighting each other.

# Slurtle Slime Production Guide

This guide explains the mechanics of Slurtle Slime production.

![Slurtle Slime](Slurtle Slime.png)

Slurtle Slime is produced when a Slurtle or Snurtle consumes a certain amount of minerals, processes these minerals, and drops Slurtle Slime on the ground as a result. It has two main functions; it can be used as an explosive (similar to, but weaker than, Gunpowder) or it can be used as fuel for Lanterns.

## Slurtle and Snurtle Behavior

While Slurtles and Snurtles have a somewhat similar appearance, they behave quite differently. Slurtles are neutral mobs (they become aggressive toward the player if provoked), while Snurtles are passive (meaning they will never attack the player).

Slurtles can be provoked in two different ways. A Slurtle will become aggressive when the player attacks it or if the player is carrying minerals when there are no minerals to be consumed off the ground. For this reason, it is recommended to use Snurtles for slime production, rather than Slurtles, if possible.

## Mineral Values

The table below shows every type of mineral that a Slurtle or Snurtle will consume. Each mineral has a value associated with it, relating to the amount of Slurtle Slime that will be produced. In general, one unit of Slurtle Slime is equal to a total mineral value of 5 (this is explained in the next section).

| Mineral | Mineral Value |
|---------|--------------|
| Rock    | 1            |
| Flint   | 1            |
| Thulecite Fragments | 1 |
| Salt Crystals | 1 |
| Slingshot Ammo | 1 |
| Gold Nugget | 2 |
| Nitre | 2 |
| Stone Fruit | 2 |
| Thulecite | 3 |
| Blue Gem | 5 |
| Red Gem | 5 |
| Orange Gem | 5 |
| Yellow Gem | 5 |
| Green Gem | 5 |
| Purple Gem | 5 |
| Iridescent Gem | 5 |
| Amberosia | 12.5 |

*Note that Thulecite, Orange Gems, Yellow Gems and Green Gems are either non-renewable or rare resources, and are needed for top-tier crafting recipes, so it may be more desirable to use the more common types of minerals for the purpose of Slurtle Slime production.*

## Slurtle Slime Production

A Slurtle or Snurtle will consume a total mineral value of at least 5 before it begins the slow process of physically producing Slurtle Slime. If the total amount of minerals consumed has a value greater than n*5 (e.g. if the creature eats a lot of items quickly), then n units of Slurtle Slime are produced (as a stack). Due to the incredibly slow speed in which they process each mineral, it is unlikely that more than 2 units of Slurtle Slime will ever be produced in one stack, although it is possible, in theory.

## Trivia

* The mineral values used in the above table can also be used to calculate how long a Rock Lobster will follow the player.

# How To Access The Cheat Screen

To access the cheat screen is very simple. You do not need to download any programs "recommended" to do this, you just need a working mouse and a downloaded and bought version of [Don't Starve](Don't Starve). You only need to do these few steps once and throughout all the old versions and current to new versions, you do not need to ever do this step again.

1. Hit Start Button on the bottom left side of the screen
2. Click on "Documents" on the right side of the window that popped up.
3. Double click on the "Klei" folder
4. Double click on "DoNotStarve"
5. Double click on "settings"
6. Change `ENABLECONSOLE = false` to `ENABLECONSOLE = true`
7. Launch Don't Starve

# Different Cheat Codes

To access each cheat window, press the `'` key (Or ~ key if on American keyboard). A window as on the right should appear where you can input the code EXACTLY as you see it. Press enter once to enter the code. If the screen does not add any text, you put it in correctly, if the screen adds text, then you have to put it in again correctly. To exit the screen at any time, press the ~ key once again. To go back to a previous cheat, press the up arrow and change it to your liking or the correct way. Pressing ENTER will submit what you currently have. If ever you want to clear all the text once you exit the cheat box, press CTRL+L, this will clear up the entire text. When you open the box again, however, the text will reappear. These cheat boxes work on every Character and some cheats require two steps (AKA two different inputs). More will be described when necessary.

## To Spawn In Mobs

Steps:
- Press the ~ to open the window
- Type in the code EXACTLY as you see it
- Press the ENTER key
- Press the ~ to open the window
- Type in the code changing prefab to the mob and amount to how many you want
- Press the ENTER key

Info: This cheat spawns in the preferred amount of mobs you want, but some of them have a different name, such as the [Treeguard] being called the leif because in the coding of the game treeguard is mentioned as leif. If you want to know what all the names are for some mobs, you can check on the World editor screen where you can mouseover the few mobs listed. These mobs are the most common next to the birds. The other way is to visit this wiki and search up the specific types of animals or creatures from the mob page. To enter this code you need to type code one in first, then hit enter, and type in the second code, changing prefab to the mod and amount to how much you want.

| Code 1: RunScript("consolecommands") | Code 2: c_spawn("prefab", amount) |
| Result: Spawns in the preferred mod and how many you wished to have |

## To Spawn In Items

Steps:
- Find the name of the prefab(entity) you want to spawn ([Console/Prefab List])
- Press the ~ to open the window
- Type in the code EXACTLY as you see it
- Press the ENTER key
- Press the ~ to open the window
- Type in the code EXACTLY as you see it, replacing amount and "prefab" with the item you want
- Press the ENTER key

Info: With this, you can have as much items as you want. Take note of your inventory space requirements. Any items you cannot carry will be dropped on the floor.

Do note that the prefab names are different from the names in-game. For example, if you want a Wood Wall, the prefab name is `wall_wood_item`.

Multiple prefab items cannot be spawned at one go. Each prefab item will need to have its own command called to spawn it.

| Code 1: RunScript("consolecommands") | Code 2: c_give("prefab", amount) |
| Result: Gives you the preferred amount of items you put in. |

## To Activate Godmode

Steps:
- Press the ~ to open the window
- Type in the code EXACTLY as you see it
- Press the ENTER key

Info: This is a very helpful code if you want to go into adventure mode and not really hack in any items or mods. All you do is type in the little code and your health never drops, your insanity stays the same (Now it won't deplete any if you eat a mushroom) and your hunger is set, even if you eat or don't eat! Do note that in Winter, you don't need any heatstones or hats and

## Quotes

- Wilson: Scientifically speaking, it shouldn't exist.
- Willow: I'm gonna set it on fire!
- Wolfgang: Stay still so Wolfgang can fight you!
- Wendy: You'll die just like everything else.
- WX78: ERROR. MALWARE DETECTED

- Warly: Pardon me, Monsieur.
- Woodlegs: 'Tis a land Leviathan!
- Wilba: BEAST WITH ONE BACK
- Wormwood: Big Wiggler
- Wheeler: Time to use those dodging skills, Wheeler.

## Tips

- Drinking Coffee, Tea, using a Stalking Stick or a Walking Cane are ways to have an advantage over the Pugalisk, as its Freezing Attack has a Range.
- Pugalisk will stop the Freezing Range Attack if the players moves too far.
- It is not advised to tank the Pugalisk as his head does 150 Damage.
- Standing next to the fountain will cause Pugalisk to start circling it. This allows the player to keep Pugalisk at bay if done correctly until it starts using its ranged attack.
- Explosives can kill Pugalisk instantly. Easiest way to do it is to equip a Coconade, light it with a torch then throw it near the opened skin.

## Trivia

- The Pugalisk is a portmanteau of a pug and a basilisk.
- The Pugalisk's ranged attack may be referencing the purported ability of a basilisk to kill or petrify victims by looking at them.
- Its name may also be a reference to the word "pugilist", meaning "fighter."
- Sometimes the Pugalisk will taunt the player after killing them, by sticking its tongue out and hissing.
- AoE attacks will cause the Pugalisk much more damage.
- The Pugalisk drops the highest amount of Monster Meat out of all the Mobs, even more so than the Varg.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "None for me, thank you."
- Willow: "Alright smelly, eat up!"
- Wolfgang: "Hair-cow, come! Wolfgang has food for you!"
- Wendy: "I wouldn't want my beefalo to starve."
- WX78: "COME EAT YOUR STICKS"
- Wickerbottom: "Beefalo seem to be quite adept at digesting sticks."
- Woodie: "Come and get it!"
- Maxwell: "I suppose I'd better keep the stupid beast fed."
- Wigfrid: "I must keep my beast fed and battle-ready."
- Webber: "We take good care of our beefalo."
- Warly: "My beast could use some more meat on its bones."
- Wormwood: "Belly stuff for Shaggy Buddy"

- Wortox: "It really sticks to the ribs, hyuyu!"
- Wurt: "Big fuzzy! Have sticks for you!"
- Walter: "Come here, beefalo! Dinner time!"
- Wanda: "Did i remember to feed my beefalo today?"

Steamed Twigs is a **Crock Pot** food added to **Don't Starve Together**. It can be eaten by **Beefalo** but not by players and is classified as **Roughage**. It requires one **Inedible** ingredient and does not accept **Meat**, **Fish**, **Monster Food**, **Eggs**, **Dairy**, or **Magic** ingredients. The simplest recipe uses four **Twigs**, but **Fruits**, **Vegetables**, and **Ice** can also be used as the filler.

## Recipe
| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Inedible| x1    |
| Filler  | x3    |

**Tool**: Crock Pot  
**Result**: Steamed Twigs

**Note**: Filler cannot be Meats, Fishes, Monster Food, Eggs, Dairy, and Magic Value.

## Examples

1. 
| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Twigs   | x4    |

2. 
| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Twigs   | x2    |
| Potato  | x1    |

3. 
| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Bone Shards | x1 |
| Volt Goat Horn | x1 |
| Twigs    | x2    |

## Tips
- If the player wants to cook **Wet Goop** instead, which is used to craft the **Terra Firma Tamper**, they can do this by cooking three Twigs and a Meat, an Egg, a Dairy food or a Nightmare Fuel. This is because those ingredients are excluded from the Steamed Twigs recipe.
- It is worth considering that beefalo get 4 times more health than what is listed. Steamed Twigs grant 2.66x the amount of Hunger that 4 twigs would give, and 7.5x the Health.

# Renewable Resources in Don't Starve

This page lists every renewable resource in the game and explains some of the ways to farm them.

## Crops

Please note that as of the [Reap What You Sow Update](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/124931-reap-what-you-sow-update-now-available/) for DST Basic and Advanced Farms are no longer part of the base game.

**Crops** are food items one can get from Basic and Advanced **Farms**. Once a farm is placed and a seed is planted, a plant will grow in 600 (Advanced Farm) or 1200 (Basic Farm) daylight seconds. The crops grow during day time or dusk time. The crops can grow at night if it is within 70% of the light radius of a star from Star Caller's Staff. The growing process can be sped by fertilizing it with **Manure**, **Rot**, **Guano** or **Rotten Egg**s, with guano being the best. Produce from the farms can be fed to birds in Bird Cages to get Crop Seeds, which can be used to grow crops knowing what it will produce. Farm will have to be refertilized after 20-30 uses.

Crops from the farms can be fed to birds in Bird Cages to obtain 1.5 **Crop Seeds**, which can be used to grow specific crops; 0.5 normal seeds is also produced by the bird in Bird Cages. Feeding crops to the birds allows the player to focus on growing rare crops, without also getting many more common crops; about 2/3 of the crops will end up as seeds for future crops.

### List of Crops

All of these can be cooked or used to make various **Crock Pot** foods.

- **Corn (Common Vegetable)**: Good to eat raw, or to be made into **powdercake**. 
- **Carrot (Common Vegetable)**: Good for befriending **bunnyman** and building **Rabbit Hutch**. 
- **Pumpkin (Uncommon Fruit)**: Good to eat cooked, over fire. Used for making **Scarecrow**.
- **Eggplant (Uncommon Vegetable)**: Good to eat cooked, over fire. When cooked, Braised Eggplant is a good healing food, healing 20 health with fast eating animation. 
- **Pomegranate (Rare Fruit)**: Good to eat cooked, over fire. When cooked, Sliced Pomegranate is a good healing food, healing 20 health with fast eating animation.
- **Durian (Rare Fruit)**: A fruit version of Monster Meat. Durians count as Monster food for the purpose of crock pot dishes.
- **Dragon Fruit (Rare Fruit)**: Good for ingredient as one of the best healing foods in the game, **Dragonpie** (restores 40 health and 75 hunger, with fast eating animation).
- **Watermelon (Uncommon Fruit)**: Good raw or cooked, or used to make **Melonsicle** (restores 3 health, 12.5 hunger, and 20 sanity).

## Berries

**Berries** are found growing on Berry Bushes that spawn across the land. The bushes can be dug up, using a **Shovel**, and planted elsewhere. Replanted bushes will need to be fertilized after planting and again if over-picked. You will see berries slightly appear and then fill in. If you (or usually a **Gobbler**) picks them too early the bush will return to its dormant state. There is a finite number of bushes in each world, but they are numerous. They are found primarily in grass biomes and occasionally forest biomes.

## Grass and Saplings

Like berries, there are a finite number of **Grass Tuft**s and **Sapling**s, however they are very common. Once replanted, Saplings do not need fertilizing, however Grass does. As with berries, either build **Lightning Rods** or space the plants out, as fires can destroy compact farms.

## Spiky Bushes

**Spiky Bush**es are found in Swamps and can be harvested for Twigs, like Saplings. Unlike Saplings, however, they grow during winter, which can be useful, but they damage the player when harvested (armor decreases the damage). The player can obtain a twig without taking damage by digging up the spiky bush with a **Shovel** (the spiky bush can later be replanted).

## Seeds and Eggs

You can find **seeds** randomly around the world whenever a bird lands, however to farm them all you have to do is feed a **caged bird** any vegetable (excluding berries). You can get **

# Magma Field
The **Magma Field** is a new **Biome** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is characterized by dark and craggy terrain. **Magma Piles** are found here, which may sometimes spawn **Krissure**s when dug up with a **Shovel**. **Flint** and **Rocks** are found on the ground and **Boulders** are abundant in this biome, while **Saplings** are uncommon. **Tallbirds** can also be found here. It is covered in **Magma Turf** which can be dug up with a **Pitchfork**. **Toucan**s are birds that land in this biome.

## Trivia
- Magma Fields, like **Mangrove** biomes, rarely ever are entire islands of themselves and instead commonly intersect with other **Shipwrecked** biomes.
- It is possible to find a Magma Field filled with **Fire|burnt** **Tree/Jungle|Jungle Trees**.

# Surviving in the Volcano

Surviving in the volcano can be crazy, however paradoxically it is the safest place to be during **volcanic eruptions** in dry seasons. You are never obliged to enter the **Volcano**. In other seasons, you can travel and explore without complications, but the constant eruptions and the withered or burning of plants and farms in Dry Season can make you think it’s better to stay away from each structure, base and other important object or mob that can burn, be destroyed or die, making things like picking elephant cactus, coffee plants, mining obsidian, dragoon hearts, make crafts for the volcanic tab etc.

## Into the Volcano

The volcano biome is very hot. The closer you get to the center, the hotter it gets.

### Problems and Solutions

1. **Overheating**: You should carry a **Tropical Fan** or **Dumbrella** and additionally prototype build an **Endothermic Fire Pit**, at least one **Crock Pot**, an **Ice Maker 3000** a **Siesta Lean-to** or **Palm Leaf Hut** and an **Ice Box**.

2. **Farming Difficulty**: The high temperature of the **Volcanic biome** makes farming without the **Ice Flingomatic** very difficult, since withering is automatic. Butterflies also don't come out of flowers and bees don't produce honey.

3. **Equipment**: Always have ice ready (for eating and reducing temperature), a spear or better, a football helmet and log suit armor for battling the Dragoons while traveling, since the dropped Monster Meat can be converted into Meatballs easily.

## Tips

- If you want to dig up Coffee or the Elephant-Cacti, remember to do it in Dry season. If you do it in other seasons, remember to fertilize the plant with ash, otherwise you will permanently destroy it. Both Cacti and Coffee plants are non-renewable.
- You will not find any sanity raising items in the volcano. Your best friend is thus **Rawling**.
- Hail, rain and strong winds still appear inside volcano
  - However, flooding, poison mosquitoes, hound-attacks and the Sealnado do not appear, which means you can hide before these in the Volcano.
- Using a Tropical fan will lower your Obsidian charges, dropping your luminity. Be careful with it and maybe carry an emergency torch.
- Don't make your base directly at the entrance of the volcano, search an area without Dragoons and Lava Pools or very far away of them.
- You can travel during Dry season normally. The warning from the Volcano gives you enough time to enter it and be safe from the eruption.
- Two charcoal in an Ice maker 3000 make 3x Ice. Combined with a monster meat in a crock pot, you can make Meatballs.
- The altar of snackrifice can increases until 4 day eruptions or reduces a 0.
- Keep away from the Lava pool. It increases temperature very fast.
- Attack one or two dragoons maximum at a time, more can be unmanageable and result in your death.
- When dealing with dragoons, simply kite their charge and smash away.
- Eating a Dragoon Heart makes you glow for 1 minute. Use it wisely. Luckily, Dragoons respawn and their Dens craftable.
- Remember that the coffee and cacti can be fertilized ONLY with ash and ONLY grow on Volcano turf.
- You can get the greatest amount of rocks, ashes, bones, monster meat and charcoal, as well as exclusively Obsidian from the Volcano than in any other biome.
- Despite the volcano having a lot of light light you are still vulnerable to Charlie.
- Learn recipes and gather resources for dishes that reduce temperature.

# Relics

Relics (and Broken Relics) are the remains of the Ancient Civilization found in the Ruins and in the Ancient Archive. Broken Relics can be repaired with Rocks, Cut Stone, and Stone Wall to restore 5 Sanity. Smashing it (but not destroyed) and repairing it again will gain 5 Sanity again.

When destroyed, via Hammer or explosives like Gunpowder, they can drop various items.

## Relics and Drops

The player can sit on Chairs if they aren't broken and they aren't occupied by other players or a Resting Horror.

# Replica Relic

Players can craft Replica Relics in the Decorations Filter. To obtain the rare Blueprints required to prototype them, one has to insert a specific combination of items into the Ancient Chest and close it. The items must be placed into the chest in the precise order as shown, and will be consumed in the process. The valid combinations and crafting recipes for the Replica Relics are listed below:

| Replica Relic | Input in Ancient Chest | Crafting Recipe |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Replica Relic Chair "A weathered-looking chair." | Thulecite Medallion, Cut Stone, Nightmare Fuel, Purple Gem, Rabbit, Petals | Cut Stone ×1 |
| Replica Relic Table "Don't put your elbows on it." | Thulecite Medallion, Cut Stone, Nightmare Fuel, Purple Gem, Crow, Rabbit | Cut Stone ×4 |

| Replica Relic Dish "Don't double dip." | Thulecite Medallion, Cut Stone, Nightmare Fuel, Carrot, Berries, Petals | Cut Stone ×1 |

Additionally, the Blueprint for the Replica Relic Chair is also obtainable by killing the Resting Horror that appears on an existing Relic Chair in the Ruins.

Also, like the original version, players can sit on the Relic Chair.

# Playing as Wendy, the Bereaved

![Wendy DST](Wendy_DST.png)

"Abigail? Come back! I'm not done playing with you." - Wendy

This guide will provide an overview of playing as Wendy, the Bereaved, including her strengths, weaknesses, and effective strategies utilizing her twin sister, Abigail.

## Character Summary

Wendy excels in employing detailed tactics and strategies in combat, often engaging in large-scale battles that last into the night. Her key strength is a slower sanity drain from monsters and the gradual drain of dusk and night, allowing her more freedom during nighttime compared to other characters.

One of the initial challenges when playing as Wendy is her lack of physical strength, which makes kiting crucial and timing enemy attacks important to avoid being overwhelmed, especially without Abigail's assistance.

## Abigail

Abigail, Wendy's deceased sister, is summoned through her Flower, costing 50 Sanity. Abigail is not invincible, having 600 HP, and will follow Wendy while maintaining a distance unless attacking or provoked. She will attack enemies that engage Wendy or herself and can target hostile creatures independently. Abigail turns red when damaging or being damaged, using a short-range AoE attack that strengthens with the fall of darkness.

### In Don't Starve Together

In the multiplayer version, both Abigail and Wendy have received enhancements. Abigail becomes more damaging during daylight and dusk, while Wendy manages her sanity better and doesn't lose Sanity when near ghosts. Wendy can prepare Ghostly Elixirs to trigger powerful effects when administered to Abigail, requiring Mourning Glories gathered by assisting Pipspooks.

The elixirs Wendy can craft include:

- **Revenant Restorative**: Heals Abigail's ectoplasmic wounds.
- **Spectral Cure-All**: A more potent healing item for extended fights.
- **Unyielding Draught**: Enhances Abigail's shield.
- **Distilled Vengeance**: Punishes enemies attacking Abigail's shields.
- **Nightshade Nostrum**: Empowers Abigail's attacks to deal 40 HP.
- **Vigor Mortis**: Increases Abigail's movement speed.

Mastering Abigail's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for effective gameplay with Wendy.

## Abigail's Flower

Abigail is summoned using her Flower. Killing any creature (even Wendy) while the Flower is on the ground summons Abigail, incurring a 50 Sanity penalty. The Flower goes through three stages, with the fully open state indicating readiness for summoning.

In 'Don't Starve Together', the Flower's blooming states represent Abigail's power level, which can cap at level 3. The Flower will remain unbloomed if远离 Wendy or carried by another player.

### Summoning

In 'Don't Starve Together', summoning Abigail is simplified by right-clicking the Flower. Summoning grants Wendy 15 Sanity, but dismissing or destroying Abigail results in a Sanity loss.

### Abigail's Perks

Abigail has two states: Sooth, where she remains passive, and Rile Up, where she targets hostile or neutral mobs without instruction. Rile Up can distract enemies, such as Cave Spiders, allowing Wendy to mine their nests.

## Combat with Abigail

Abigail is effective against swarming creatures and those that strike at night. She can tank damage while Wendy deals her own attacks. Abigail regenerates health over time and can be resurrected multiple times in the same world.

### Recommended Targets

- **Spiders**: Abigail can handle dozens of Spiders due to their swarming behavior.
- **Bees**: Abigail can eliminate entire swarms by sitting on their hives.
- **Beefalos**: Manageable in small herds during the night.
- **Koalefant**: Assists in hunting by drawing aggro.
- **Hounds**: Effective against early waves but beware of Red Hounds' fire damage.
- **Pengulls**: Abigail can swiftly kill Pengulls for easy resources.
- **Tallbirds**: Abigail can catch up and attack Tallbirds, but be prepared to assist.

### Not Recommended

- **Tentacles**: Abigail struggles against Tentacles, which reset their attack cooldown when struck.
- **Frogs**: Swarms of Frogs can overwhelm Abigail.
- **Treeguards**: Best handled alone after Abigail's death.
- **Pigs**: Kiting AI can give Abigail trouble.
- **Merms**: Fast and swarming, making them difficult for Abigail.
- **Boss Enemies**: Generally, too powerful for Abigail.

## Notes

- Abigail's pathfinding and health management are limited.
- At low health, her appearance changes to indicate weakness.
- She is slower than Wendy and

- **Drops:** Raw Fish ×2, Shark Fin ×1, Shark Gills ×0-2

- **Willow:** Hey cutie, where's your mom?
- **Woodie:** Just a big sweet kitty cat.

The **Sharkitten** is a passive **Mob** found in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It spawns from the **Sharkitten Den** during **Monsoon Season**. If the Sharkitten Den is approached by the player, the **Tiger Shark** will return to its location to defend its Sharkittens. A Sharkitten drops 2-3 **Raw Fish**, one **Shark Fin** and 0-2 **Shark Gills** when killed. Killing one will increase the player's **naughtiness** by 4%.

## Fighting Strategy

| Weapon | Hits to Kill |
|--------|--------------|
| Spear  | 1           |
| Sleep Dart | 1           |
| Ice Staff | 1          |

## Trivia

- Sharkittens share the same base model as **Hounds**.
- Sharkittens use higher pitch versions of the **Tiger Shark**'s sounds.
- While it's implied, in-game Sharkittens do not actually grow into adult Tiger Sharks.
- Since the **Home Sea Home** update, Sharkittens now drop **Shark Fins** upon death. This was implemented to compensate for **Sea Hound**s becoming rarer.
- Sharkittens despawn when entering the Sharkitten Den. If **Walls** are placed around the Den, Sharkittens cannot return to it and therefore will not despawn. They can also be separated from their Den using the **Telelocator Staff**. If unable to reach their Den, they will remain year-round.
- The Sharkitten's name is a portmanteau of the words "shark" and "kitten".

## Bugs

- **Abigail** will target and attack the Sharkittens on her own, without Wendy attacking them first.

# Bat Bat

## Overview
The Bat Bat is a **Magical Melee Weapon**. It deals 42.5 damage per hit and has 75 uses. Each hit leeches 6.8 **HP** from non-wall targets, but drains 3.4 **Sanity** from the player if they are not at full health.

## Crafting
The Bat Bat requires a **Shadow Manipulator** to prototype and 3 **Batilisk Wings**, 2 **Living Log**s and 1 **Purple Gem** to craft.

## Availability
Bat Bats may also be found in **Ornate Chests**, which appear in the **Ruins**.

## Skins
In **Don't Starve Together**, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the **Belongings** page.

### Available Skins
- **Woven - Elegant Bat Scythe**: Introduced during the official **Hallowed Nights** event in 2018.
  - Description: "Reap some grim bodies with this bat scythe."
  - ![Ingame](Bat Scythe Wilson.png)
- **Woven - Elegant Fantasmical Bat**: Introduced during the official **Hallowed Nights** event in 2018.
  - Description: "Alas, we may never know what wondrous creature this wing might have once belonged to."
  - ![Ingame](Fantasmical Bat Wilson.png)

## Tips
- The Bat Bat's leeching ability makes it ideal for fighting dangerous enemies that cannot be easily outrun, like numerous **Hound**s or giants (especially **Dragonfly**), while wearing armor.
- The Bat Bat is immensely useful for **Wormwood**, since it allows him to easily regain the health he cannot receive from healing foods.
- Batilisk Wings needed for Bat Bats can be farmed by setting up **Rabbit Hutch**es near an open **Sinkhole**.
- A quick way to regain health is to attack **Chester**, **Packim Baggims**, **Ro Bin**, or **Hutch** with a Bat Bat, since their health regenerates quickly.
- **Maxwell**'s Sanity boost will make up for the Sanity lost from each hit when using this weapon.
- This weapon will heal a total of 510 HP while draining 255 Sanity in its lifetime.
- Bat Bats spawned in the ruins can provide helpful healing, especially if the player is underprepared or has intentionally come early.

## Trivia
- The Bat Bat was introduced in the **It's Not a Rock!** update.
- The Bat Bat was the second weaponized food item added to the game, after the **Ham Bat**.

### Advantages

Wilbur's main advantage is his ability to run. This ability is triggered by walking without stopping for 3 seconds, at which point he will start to run and hold his equipped hand-held item with his tail. While running, his base speed is increased to 8 (default value is 6), which is 33% faster than normal. This ability provides a significant advantage for getting out of situations that would otherwise overwhelm players and allows him to explore faster on land.

Wilbur's second advantage is that the Prime Apes consider him as a friend. While they will not aid him in battle without making them followers with Bananas, they will also avoid their typical harassment, such as rushing to pick up harvested items. In addition, since they are friendly, they will continue their helpful actions, such as picking [Grass Tuft]s and [Sapling]s and tossing the harvested items to him. While same effects can be achieved for a limited time by other Characters by feeding a Banana to a Prime Ape, Wilbur can enjoy the benefits without having to find Bananas or periodically feeding Prime Apes, which is especially helpful early in the game. It should be noted that the friendly Prime Apes will still pick up or harvest any [Food] they can eat, including [Vegetables] and [Fruits] grown on [Farm]s built by the player, though they only do this if they are hungry.

Wilbur's ability to produce Manure every 2-5 days is also a minor advantage, allowing access to Farms and easy fertilization without having to find Prime Apes, [Water Beefalo]s or [Wildbore]s, which may be hard to come by in some [world]s. Wilbur can also equip a stack of Manure and use it as a ranged weapon. Each throw will remove a single Manure from the stack. Thrown Manure will travel through a parabolic path, unlike Prime Apes' more direct [Manure] throw, and will land at the targeted area after a delay. When it hits the ground or water, it will deal 10 damage to all nearby [Mobs]. Thrown Manure is destroyed and cannot be recovered. Hitting a bird with Manure will stun it, allowing it to be captured alive.

Wilbur gains 10 sanity when eating [Bananas].

### Disadvantages

Wilbur's most apparent disadvantage is his inability to speak. This makes it difficult for players to receive announcements about incoming dangers, such as [Volcano] eruptions and [Hound] attacks, and makes preparing for them more difficult. Players must pay attention to visual and sound clues to get these warnings while playing as Wilbur.

Although Wilbur has greater speed while running, his base speed is slower, with a penalty of -0.5 (5.5 total speed without additional modifiers, which is about 8.3% slower than normal). This puts him at a disadvantage when frequent stops are made while moving, since 3 seconds of movement pass before starting to run. While running, his hunger drains 33% faster than a normal character. Even so, he does arrive at his destination 33% sooner than a normal character, covering the same ground for the same hunger cost.

### Prototype Tips

- Despite being made with a Banana, Wilbur will not gain extra sanity from Banana Pops.
- Even though Prime Apes are friendly towards Wilbur, the Prime Apes will steal and eat crops on Farms, as well as Berries from Berry Bushes. Players should keep this in mind before building a base near uncontrolled Prime Ape Huts.
- Prime Apes only pick up food if they are hungry (as opposed to always). Players can mitigate this if they drop off excess Seaweed or Berries at the entrance of their base (though not as a stack, as they will pick up the whole stack). Prime Apes will also drop off manure at their hut when they retreat. This

# SURVIVING 101 WITH: WILSON P. HIGGSBURY

## PART 1: STARTING OFF IN YOUR WORLD WITH WILLOW

**WPH:** Ah, welcome, to Surviving 101 with me, Wilson! Today we will be having Willow join us!

**W:** Oh, hi.

**WPH:** We will be teaching you what to do when you first arrive in Maxwell's World! Willow, take it away!

---

**Okay! Hello, dorks. I'm Willow, The Firestarter. As the science-y guy said, I'll be helping you survive for your first day. So, let's start. When you first wake up, you will want to start exploring. These are the key materials to gather first:**

- **FLINT**
- **TWIGS**
- **GRASS**
- **FOOD**

**Got all that? Okay, now, here's the situation. You found some flint and twigs, and now you can craft either an axe or a [pickaxe], but you only have enough materials for one of the two. Here's the question:**

**Which one should I craft first?**

**Your solution is here: If there are boulders nearby, craft a pickaxe! You can mine for more flint and get rocks! If there are no rocks nearby, explore and find some quick! After getting enough flint and twigs, craft your axe. Start chopping down some trees, but here's a word or two of advice:**

- **Chop only, and only, the medium and large-sized trees. If you are desperate for wood, and all of the medium-large trees are chopped down, and the small ones are the only ones left, chop them down. Don't forget to replant the trees! (replant them by planting the pinecones)**

**However, you will need to plant your trees a bit far from your base.**

**Why?**

- **Because if you chop down one of the trees, there's a chance that a [Treeguard] could come alive and kill you. Yes, you heard me, KILL YOU. Don't plant them too close to each other, either. (I am not saying that you should plant your trees a pond away from each other, just don't plant them too close.) Anyways, next, craft a torch. By this time it should be night, so now you'll have to equip the torch. Survived? Yay! Anyways, now, explore a bit more, and find an appropriate base camp spot. (click here for more info of [Guides/Base Camp Guide|bases]]) Next, make a fire pit to mark your base. Then, go mining for more rocks and gold. After that, go to your base again, and make a [Science Machine]. Craft a backpack for additional storage. Now, make a crock pot.**

**A crock pot? What's that?**

- **The crock pot is a little nifty foodmaker. You add food items into the Crock Pot and it makes a new food item out of all the food ingredients. All of the stats of the original foods are combined, making a powerful meal.**

**What do I need to make a crock pot?**

- **Check this [Crock Pot|page].**

**How do I get charcoal? Or cut stone?**

- **To get charcoal, light some trees on fire. Then, when the fire goes out, chop down the burnt trees. They should drop one charcoal. To make cut stone is easy. Just grab your stone and head over to the Science Machine. Then, prototype the Cut Stone, and bam! You have it.**

**Now, gather some more materials, and make an Alchemy Engine. You can now craft and do whatever you want! To get food, just make some traps and place them on rabbit holes. You're welcome, and that's it for my part. See ya!**

- **Walter:** "They're just trying to protect their queen."
- **Wanda:** "If only I had a little army that would protect me this fiercely!"
- **Choose:** WX-78

## Description
Grumble Bees are a type of bee **Mob** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. They are summoned by the **Bee Queen** to aid her in fights. They have small wings and a large stinger, a black and yellow abdomen, and brown fur around their head.

The Bee Queen will spawn them in groups of three or four, and they will attack the Queen's target alongside her. Grumble Bees have a very low chance to drop a **Stinger** when killed.

### Behavior
Grumble Bees will kite their target, and will continue chasing them after attacking. They have a high movement speed, which can be boosted even further by the Bee Queen when she does her screech "attack". When they are boosted, they will dart out of reach, dart back and strike, then repeat until the boost ends, making it very hard to kite them during that time.

Attacking a Grumble Bee will also aggro all nearby **Bees**. Therefore, it is advised not to fight the Bee Queen at a location with a lot of **Beehives**, as she can just be baited away from it.

### Tips
- As the Bee Queen's health decreases, she starts to spawn Grumble Bees more often. In the early stages, she will only spawn Grumble Bees if none are present, which means that leaving one Grumble Bee alive will prevent her from spawning more early in the fight.

### Trivia
- Grumble Bees were introduced in the **Cute Fuzzy Animals** update.
- "Grumble Bee" is a play on the words "Bumblebee" and "Grumble".
- They appear to be based on real-life Honeybee "drones", the only male bees in the hive.
  - However, Maxwell refers to them as female. (Unless he is talking to the Bee Queen that spawned them.)

- Despite being "loyal to the queen", if a Bee Queen accidentally attacks one, all Grumble Bees and Bees in the area will temporarily aggro on the Bee Queen.

# Instructional

The following is a script that can be used to start a dedicated server on boot/reboot of the host. This was setup after noticing my Ubuntu Server 14.0 had rebooted after updates which in-turn killed the DST dedicated server.

If you have not yet setup a dedicated server on a Linux machine I would recommend using the following as reference. This was used to setup DST on my Linux server: [Don’t Starve Together Dedicated Servers](http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Don’t_Starve_Together_Dedicated_Servers) [Simple Dedicated Server Setup](http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Guides/Simple_Dedicated_Server_Setup)

You'll need to create the file in your `/etc/init.d/` directory (command supplied below). If you followed the above guide then the directories should be the same. I named the file "start_dst" for my own reference you may change it "name".sh with out the quotes.

## Create the file:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/init.d/start_dst.sh
```

## Script:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

## BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:dst
# Short-Description: Don't starve server
# Description: Starts a Dont Starve Together server
### END INIT INFO

NAME="Dont Starve together"
# The user that you installed DST server as
USER="steam"
SCREENREF="DST"
# Should be the same as the dedicated server's install directory
BINARYPATH="/home/steam/steamapps/DST/bin"
BINARYNAME="dontstarve_dedicated_server_nullrenderer"
PIDFILE="dstserver.pid"

cd "$BINARYPATH"

running() {
 if [ -n "`pgrep -f $BINARYNAME`" ]; then
 return 0
 else
 return 1
 fi
}

start() {
 if ! running; then
 echo -n "Starting the $NAME server... "
 start-stop-daemon --start --chuid $USER --user $USER --chdir $BINARYPATH --exec "/usr/bin/screen" -- -dmS $SCREENREF $BINARYPATH

 if [ -s $PIDFILE ]; then
 echo "Done"
 else
 echo "Failed"
 rm $PIDFILE
 fi
 else
 echo "The $NAME server is already started."
 fi
}

stop() {
 if running; then
 echo -n "Stopping the $NAME server... "
 kill `cat $PIDFILE`
 while running; do
 sleep 1
 done
 rm $PIDFILE
 echo "Done"
 else
 echo "The $NAME server is already stopped."
 fi
}

case "$1" in
 start)
 start

 else
 echo "The $NAME server is stopped."
 fi
 ;;
 *)
 echo "Usage: $0 (start|stop|restart|status)"
 exit 1
 ;;
esac
exit 0
```
Navigate to the directory you created the file earlier.
```bash
cd /etc/init.d/
```
Update the file to be executable:
```bash
sudo chmod +x start_dst.sh
```
Allow the script to run on boot:
```bash
sudo update-rc.d start_dst.sh defaults
```

I used the script supplied on this page for reference modifying the INIT information to point to the appropriate directories for DST. [Linux Dedicated Server](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Linux_dedicated_server)

## Usage
The Walking Cane is a tool Item that can also be used as a Weapon. It requires 1 Walrus Tusk, 2 Gold Nuggets, and 4 Twigs to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. It increases the character's movement speed by 25% while equipped. The Walking Cane can be used to craft the Lazy Explorer.

## Skins
- Woven - Elegant Candy Cane: Introduced during the official Winter's Feast event in 2019.
- Woven - Elegant Corrupted Cane: Introduced during the official Year of the Carrat event in 2020.
- Woven - Elegant Goatshead Cane: Introduced during the official The Gorge event in 2018.
- Timeless Ancient Cane: Awarded for solving the Metheus Puzzles, along with the Ancient King's Chest.

## Tips
- The Walking Cane can also be used as a weapon, although it is amongst the weakest in the game, as it only deals half the damage of a Spear when used as a weapon. However, it has an infinite durability, so it can be swung indefinitely.
- The Walking Cane's speed boost puts the Character on the same level as many other creatures who could otherwise outrun them, including Followers like Chester. This is amplified by both natural and Cobblestone roads, for a combined increase of movement speed by 62.5%, allowing players to outrun most mobs in the game.
- The Walking Cane is essential in some fights, as it allows the player to often pull out a single additional hit before needing to dodge the attack. For example, the bonus movement speed allows the player to deal more damage to Treeguards and all of seasonal giants, assuming the player is used to changing the weapon and the Walking Cane during the fight.
- Thanks to its utility during fights, PC players are recommended to switch their weapon to the Walking Cane using the numbers on their keyboards when kiting (more preferably 1, 2 or 3 since they are close to the WASD keys), and then switch back to the weapon when hitting.
- A Walking Cane's infinite durability and high attack speed makes it a decent weapon against some low HP and easy to stunlock mobs, such as Rabbits, Spiders, Bees, larger mobs that do not fight back such as the Lureplants or some very fragile entities such Ancient Fuelweaver's Woven Shadows.
- One can stack the speed bonus with the Magiluminescence to have a total increase of 50% movement speed while both items are worn, which means that while on a road, the player will have a 95% speed boost

- Any durability Top Hat can be used when crafting a Prestihatitator and will drop a full durability Top Hat when the Prestihatitator is hammered down.
- Beardlings can be used instead of Rabbits to craft a Prestihatitator.
- Rabbits produced from this machine are homeless and sleep outside at night, making them easy food.
- After a Shadow Manipulator is built, the prestihatitator can be safely destroyed as all its crafts are also covered by the Shadow Manipulator.

## Trivia
- The name "Prestihatitator" is a portmant

# Spider Monkey

**Exclusivity**: Hamlet

## Mob Infobox
- **Drops**: Monster Meat ×2, Spider Gland 75%, Beard Hair ×3, Silk 25%, Manure (periodically)
- **Health**: 550
- **Damage**: 60
- **Attack Period**: 2
- **Attack Range**: 4
- **Walk Speed**: 5.5
- **Run Speed**: 5.5
- **Spawn Code**: "spider_monkey"
- **Spawn From**: Cocooned Tree

## Quotes
- Wilson: That thing is rather large!
- Willow: Ugh, what are you?!
- Wolfgang: Is very bad!
- Wendy: At least it will be a quick end.
- WX-78: IT IS RUNNING INCOMPATIBLE SOFTWARE
- Wickerbottom: An Arachnid Hominidae, if I'm not mistaken.
- Woodie: He's lookin' for a kerfuffle.
- Maxwell: I command you to stay back.
- Wagstaff: Presumably, the terrifying arachnid arms are just vestigial.
- Wigfrid: I shall vanquish thee!
- Webber: You're not a friend!
- Walani: Get out of here, grom!
- Warly: I've no interest in monkey business.
- Woodlegs: Man th'cannons!
- Wilba: THOU LUMP OF FOUL DEFORMITY!
- Wormwood: Leggy Bug? or Cheeky?
- Wheeler: Because being a giant ape wasn't enough, you had to add spider legs.

## Description
A Spider Monkey is an aggressive Monster exclusive to the Hamlet DLC. It spawns from Cocooned Trees and is a huge ape-like creature with spider legs on its back.

## Tips
- Each Spider Monkey herd spawns 1 Spider Monkey per day until it reaches its size cap. This means it is safe to regularly kill Spider Monkeys to farm their drops or make chopping down the cocooned trees easier as long as you don't kill all of them. It is recommended that you keep at least 2 alive at all times and not kill them or chop cocooned trees while Rabid Beetles are active as they and Snaptooths may render them extinct especially when they try to move to their new nests.
- Spider monkeys will not change aggro until its first target is dead. They share this with Tallbirds.

## Trivia
- It appears to share the same base model with the Boarilla, a Mob exclusive to the Don't Starve Together event The Forge.
- Although they are spider-like mobs, Webber cannot befriend them and they will attack Webber if approached. The same applies to Wilbur, despite also being monkey-like mobs.
- In the game files, there is an unused prefab by the name of spider Spiderape, which may be why this creature's looks more closely resemble apes than monkeys.
- The Spider Monkey's name is most likely a reference to the real-life spider monkey.
- There was a bug that caused it to only inflict 20 damage. This was later fixed.
- They seem unable to change aggro until their initial target dies or it loses interest, this can be abused by leaving Ro-bin nearby and drawing their aggro to it, leaving them vulnerable to attack.
- Spider monkeys spawn from their nest only when the player is far away from them (off-screen), as there is no spawning animation.
- According to Wickerbottom, its scientific name is Arachnid Hominidae. In biological taxonomy, "Arachnid" is a class of joint-legged invertebrate animals (arthropods), in the subphylum Chelicerata, and "Hominidae" is a family of bipedal mammals of the order Primates.
- Spider Monkeys breed like Volt Goats and Beefalos, the Cocooned Tree is only there to mark their territory but they still need a Cocooned Tree to be able to breed.
- Spider Monkeys work like herds, so you can move the entire herd by breaking their current homes.

# Adventure Mode

Adventure Mode is initiated when a player activates Maxwell's Door. The player will then encounter 5 randomized worlds, each titled, and given a divining rod to find parts of a Teleportato, and proceed onto the next level. At the spawn, the divining rod is always present. During adventure mode, the player's current progress in the original world where the portal was found will not be lost if the player dies. There are 6 levels: Archipelago, The Game Is Afoot, King of Winter, A Cold Reception, Two Worlds, and Darkness.

## General Tips

This section is to provide general tips applicable to all levels.

- At the end of each world, the following will be carried to the next level:
  - Your current Health, Hunger, and Sanity are carried over between worlds. Having these as high as possible before leaving the previous world will help you in the next stage.
  - The knowledge that the character has will be brought to the next level.
  - Only 4 slots of items can be brought to the next level.
  - Built items that haven't been placed (Crockpots, Campfires, etc. Just cancel placement after building.)

- In each world, one or two out of four resources will be harder to get:
  - Flint: Flint does not spawn in the open. Most rocks are replaced by boulders that do not drop flint.
  - Wood: Evergreens are replaced by spiky trees or lumpy evergreens.
  - Grass: Grass is mostly picked and needs fertilizing.
  - Twigs: Saplings are replaced with spiky bushes.

- In addition, fewer berry bushes and rabbit holes will spawn.
- Wickerbottom has an early advantage, Wilson has an advantage with winter maps, WX-78 has later chapter advantage, and Maxwell and Wendy have an advantage in the fifth chapter. Players who suffer resource problems should use Woodie and Willow for their Character items. Wolfgang works if the player acquires abundant amounts of food or plans to rush through the mode.
- The bridges are blocked by Boulders, level 3 Spider Dens, Hound Mounds, Obelisks, Killer Bee Hives, Evil Flowers, Clockwork Knights, Tentacles, Tallbird Nests, and Pig Fortresses.
- To pass the obelisks, the player should prepare some green mushrooms to change sanity. Some obelisks will be open when the sanity is below 20%, then the next gate would be the opposite sanity.
- After the 2nd level, Pig Fortresses begin to spawn. These are dangerous because the inhabitants are hostile Guardian Pigs. It is recommended to wear at least a Log Suit to pass through. Other possibilities are to burn it down or lead hostile monsters to it. Hammering the Pig Torches will prevent the pigs from respawning.
- If at some point you are in a position with abundant resources and you have the luxury of a little more time, you may craft structures or "placeables" before moving to the next chapter. Such as a fridge, chest, crock pot, etc. Then instead of placing them on the ground, you keep them in your sidebar to place later. Since you keep all your recipes/blueprints from the previous chapters, these "to-be-placed" items will be carried over as well.
- Some levels of Adventure Mode are suited to making a base, while other levels are meant to be rushed through, as they will only get worse over time. Levels that are suited to making bases include The Game Is Afoot, Archipelago, and Two Worlds, while levels that are meant to be rushed through include King Of Winter, A Cold Reception, and Darkness.
- It's generally a good idea to hunt MacTusk N' Son as soon as one is prepared for the fight, as they have a chance of dropping the Tam o' Shanter or a Walrus Tusk. Both items are very useful throughout the adventure mode. The Tam o' Shanter is a Tier 2 warm clothing and has a large sanity boost of +6.7/min (enough to gain sanity during night) and a durability of 24 days. The Walking Cane is an indestructible item that increases walking speed by 25%, ideal for faster exploring and getting out of dangerous situations (also as an emergency weapon dealing 17 damage). It can be crafted from 2 gold, 1 walrus tusk, and 4 twigs and requires an Alchemy Engine.
- If chapter 3 is not Two Worlds, you may find a setpiece containing two maxwell statues and a trapped Wes. If you have the skill and resources to fight off the clockworks and wish to unlock him, then you should do so.

### A Cold Reception

A Cold Reception starts in autumn and quickly turns to winter. Day length is never more than one-third of a full day cycle. The spawn includes a nearby

## Description
Moon Shards are a resource exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**.

## Obtaining Moon Shards
There are various ways to obtain Moon Shards:
- Mined from **Moon Glass** boulders and **Glassed Hot Springs** in the **Lunar Island** biome.
- Found naturally on the ground of the **Lunar Mine** biome.
- Mined from **Vitreoasis** in the **Lunar Grotto**.
- **Infused Moon Shard** turns into Moon Shard as it spoils.
- **Lunar Wobster** drops one Moon Shard when killed.
- **Celestial Champion** drops a lot of shards at the end of each phase, and upon its death.
- Glassed-over **Moon Dials** will also drop a shard when Celestial Champion dies and the **Moonstorms** cease.

Hot Springs that have **Bath Bombs** thrown in will become glassed on a **Full Moon** and can be mined for Moon Shards. Mined Vitreoasis also have a chance to reappear on a Full Moon.

## Usage
Moon Shards can be used to craft items from the **Celestial Tab** via the **Celestial Altar**. They can also be used on a **Potter's Wheel** to produce glass **Sculptures**.

## Trivia
- Moon Shards were introduced in the **Return of Them#Turn of Tides** update.
- Judging by many quotes, these glasses are formed due to water saturated with lunar dirt. In the Scrapbook for **Small Vitreoasis** it is already specified that this happens only in certain light.
- Dropping models of **Infused Moon Shard** actually correspond one-to-one to the regular **Moon Shard**.

Moon Quay, also known as Moon Quay Island, is a unique area exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **The Curse of Moon Quay** update. It is a small, remote island located far out into the **Ocean**. The main land is covered with **Moon Quay Beach Turf** with extensions made of **Docks**.

### Description

The island's docks are home to **Powder Monkeys** spawning from their **Monkey Huts**. **Cannons** also appear on the docks and will be used by the monkeys when aggressive. Around the docks empty **Pirate Sloops** can be found.

The mainland is home to the **Queen of Moon Quay** surrounded by **Monkey Bars**. Nearby the queen is also the **Unnatural Portal** that sits on a dock-filled area. The portal occasionally spits out various items, primarily those related to **mobs** and resources unique to the island.

Vegetation on the mainland includes **Palmcone Trees**, **Banana Bushes**, and **Monkeytails**. **Crustashines** are a mob that roam the area and provide an amount of light at night.

Other items included on the island are **Moon Quay Pirate Banners** and pieces of **Broken Machinery** which can be hammered down for **Gears**.

When the player is close to Moon Quay island, one can find some special **Sea Stacks** with yellow paint. The closer the player gets to Moon Quay, the more Sea Stacks they can find.

### Trivia

- The island with its dock extensions is generated to look like a head with wild hair, particularly resembling **Wagstaff** who appears to be responsible for the portal and thus the occupants of the island.
- The name is a pun on "monkey", the primary inhabitants of the island.

# Stalagmite Terrain

**Spiders everywhere.** - Wolfgang

## Overview
Stalagmite Terrain is an environment that can only be found inside Caves. It has been named after the abundance of Stalagmites that can be found in these areas. Turfs like Cave Rock Turf and Guano Turf are also abundant and cover most of the area. There are no known Plants that can be found in these biomes.

There are two variants of Stalagmite Terrain, each having different features, both rarely spawning Nightmare Fissures.

## Normal
### Biome Infobox
- Image: ![Normal Stalagmite Biomes Icon](Normal Stalagmite Biomes Icon.png)
- Abundant: 
  - ![Stalagmite](Stalagmite)
  - ![Spilagmite](Spilagmite)
- Occasional: 
  - ![Nightmare Fissure](Nightmare Fissure)

The first variant is abundant with normal Stalagmites. However, being their natural habitat, these areas are also heavily infested with Cave Spiders and Spitters which live in Spilagmites. There may be branches of this biome which are not infested, depending on World Generation.

## Tall
### Biome Infobox
- Image: ![Tall Stalagmite Biomes Icon](Tall Stalagmite Biomes Icon.png)
- Abundant: 
  - ![Stalagmite](Stalagmite)
  - ![Batcave](Batcave)
- Occasional: 
  - ![Nightmare Fissure](Nightmare Fissure)
- Rare: None
- Name: Tall Stalagmite Terrain

The second variant is abundant with tall Stalagmites and considered less dangerous. Batilisks and their Guano can commonly be found here. Thulecite Sinkholes are usually found in here.

## Don't Starve Together
In Don't Starve Together, Bat Caves can rarely spawn in the Tall Stalagmite Terrain, making Batilisks renewable even in the caves.
