## Trivia
* The Mushy Cake was introduced in the "Return of Them#Forgotten Knowledge" update.
* The Mushy Cake and Grim Galette are the only dishes in DST that have only one possible recipe.
* Wendy's quote is likely a reference to the Super Mushroom and Mini Mushroom from the Super Mario series, the former making Mario grow in size and the latter, shrinking him. It could also be in part a reference to Alice in Wonderland's 'Eat Me' cake and 'Drink Me' potion.

- Wortox: "Do you spit your goop at me sir?"
- Wurt: "Glurph, spider loogies!!"
- Walter: "Ooooh! Look at you!"
- Wanda: "Leave me alone!"

### Behavior
Spitters are a cave-dwelling variety of spiders, which can spit web-projectiles as well as bite. They spawn from Spilagmites along with Cave Spiders. Like Cave Spiders, Spitters will utter low pitched roars as opposed to other spiders high pitched gurgling cries.

Spitters have the same drops as all spiders: Spider Gland, Silk, or Monster Meat. They take one hit from the Ice Staff to be frozen.

### Hunting
Because of Spilagmites' low spider count and the spitter's low damage output, the player can simply tank the attacks and kill the spider with a Log Suit or better.

However, if the player desires to avoid any damage, the best way to dodge a Spitter's webbed spit is to run at right angles to it, though they will still sometimes hit the character anyway if the Spitter is close enough.

It is recommended to use a ranged weapon on Spitters, to give the player more time to dodge the webbing. However, it may be easier to kite with a melee weapon if there is only one Spitter to fight, treating it as a Spider Warrior. Dodge its bite, then hit it a few times before it bites again.

Spitters (and other Spiders) can be caught by Traps and will drop their normal loot when murdered.

Spitters along with other Spiders will follow a character that is currently wearing a Spiderhat. However, caution must be taken as the Spiderhat decreases Sanity, which can be difficult to manage since it is always considered 'Night' underground. Also, it is important to watch the Spiderhat's durability level as the Spitters and Cave Spiders will become hostile when it runs out.

### Usage
- Monster Meat, Silk, or Spider Gland
- Spider Warrior
- Dangling Depth Dweller
- Cave Spider
- Shattered Spider
- Nurse Spider
- Sea Strider

### Shadow Rift Content
If it gets caught in the Acid Rain its damage attack will rise to +50%, move speed will rise to +15% and taking damage decreases by -25%. The fact that it is subject to the effect can be understood by the special breath that he will emit. Also, their spit will visually explode.

- Walter: Aw, they're kind of cute!
- Wanda: They're cute NOW...

## Strategy Against Moslings

- Lure the Moslings into a herd of Beefalo in heat. Be sure to have a Beefalo Hat equipped.
- Recruit a group of Pigs and/or Bunnymen (be sure not to pick up any meat, if using the latter, or they will turn aggressive towards the player).
- Use a temporary "panic room", with some sort of food in the center, to prevent the Moslings from spreading out too much. They will walk through to eat the item, triggering tooth traps while doing so. The trap-saturated hall should be as narrow as possible, due to the Moslings' fast movement speed. Hitting corners will make them stop for a moment, giving the traps a better chance of triggering (and/or giving allies more time to hit them).
- When Frog Rain occurs, the player can attempt to use the Frogs to kill the Moslings. This strategy also works against Moose/Goose.
- If near the swamp, lure the enraged Moslings there to allow tentacles to kill them.
- Wear some kind of lightning-immunity clothes, ensure light and have enough weapons to kill the entire Mosling pack. Kill Moose. When approached by now enraged Moslings quickly dodge by changing movement direction once one begins its spin attack next to you. Follow the last dodged Mosling, wait till it's spin attack animation ends and land 2-4 hits. Dodge next wave of attacks and repeat until all enemies are dead.

## Tips Against Prototype Moslings

- Another method, albeit lengthy, requiring more resources, and more difficult to put into place, is to surround the egg with Tooth Traps and then proceed to break open the egg. If they become enraged, try to dodge their attacks and reset the traps. Eventually they will all die. However, this strategy requires at least 15-20 tooth traps, making it quite expensive.
- Moslings can easily be killed while they are not enraged. However, this method involves slaying Moslings away from their parent. Simply make a room out of walls and put some food in the middle, then close the room while the Moslings are inside. Kill the Moslings safely in this room, making sure they are distanced from the nest.
- If the Moslings are allowed to spread out after hatching, they can be hard to kill due to their speed. A group of enraged Moslings can easily overwhelm even an armoured player. It's highly advisable to recruit other creatures to deal with them, while the player focuses on dodging their whirlwind attacks and directing them towards narrow areas where

## Giant Crops
Giant Crops are objects obtained by harvesting Giant Farm Plants. They can be smashed with a Hammer to drop two pieces of produce of the corresponding type plus a 75% chance for another one and two Plant Seeds of the corresponding type plus a 25% chance for another one. They can be weighed with a Produce Scale. They are moved in a similar manner as other large objects, such as Suspicious Marble.

Giant Crops spoil 4 times slower than their corresponding regular sized crops. Once rotten, they can be hammered for three Rot, one corresponding plant seed, and two spawned Fruit Flies.

Giant Crops can be waxed with a Beeswax to stop spoilage of its structure. Rotten Giant Crops will stay as a rotten structure without the need for any waxing. Waxed Giant Crops can be hammered for one rot.

## Description

A **Leaky Shack** is a naturally occurring [[Structure]] found in a [[Marsh]] biome. It is similar in appearance to a [[Pig House]], but in a dilapidated state. Their main purpose is spawning and housing [[Merm]]s. Leaky shacks can hold up to four Merms and spawn a Merm every four days if any Merms are killed. Typically only one Merm per Leaky Shack will be outside during the day. However, if that Merm engages in combat or if the house is struck with a [[Hammer]], the rest of the Merms will emerge to help it fight. When [[Dusk]] comes, all Merms will leave their home to wander around in the vicinity.

Merms are aggressively territorial and will attack any non-[[Wurt]] players or followers that wander too close to their homes. This can be circumvented by wearing a [[Clever Disguise]].

Deconstructing a Leaky Shack with a Hammer yields 1-2 [[Rocks]], 1 [[Board]], and 1 [[Freshwater Fish]]. They cannot be crafted by the player, making them [[:Category:Non-Renewable|non-renewable]].

## Trivia
Before the release of [[Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet]], Mermhouses were called Rundown Houses.

# Map

The **Map** is used to help navigate the islands of **The Constant**. Nearly all resources such as **Plants**, **Boulders**, and **Beehives** show up as icons on the Map. Different terrain types (often called **Biomes**) are clearly outlined, along with **Ocean** water. The Map shows **Roads** and **Trails**, as well as world objects such as the **Wooden Thing** or **Maxwell's Door** and built/crafted objects such as **Backpacks** and **Farms**. The map can be zoomed in for better detail, or out to see the entire world. The map is brought to view by pressing **TAB**. Pressing **TAB** again closes the map. On the PS4, the map can be opened by clicking the touch pad. On the Wii U, the map can be dragged onto the gamepad. On the Switch, the map can be opened with **-**, and closed again by pressing **B**.

![World Map](https://via.placeholder.com/300x300?text=World+Map)

> "Now I can show everyone what I found!" - Wilson

In **Don't Starve Together**, there are several objects that feature a global Map icon that can always be seen all players, even in areas that have not been explored yet. These include **Moonlenses** and all Structures crafted with them, **Moon Dial**, **Ocuvigil**, and **The Lazy Deserter**. In case of the **Celestial Orb**, the icon is even visible on the Map while the item is in a player's **Inventory** or in a container. Any player equipping a **Compass** in the hand slot will also be globally visible on the Map. The Ocuvigil serves an additional function by revealing the **Fog of War** in the area around it for all players.

![Map Scroll](https://via.placeholder.com/300x300?text=Map+Scroll)

Using the **Cartographer's Desk**, players can craft a **Map Scroll** which stores their Map exploration progress on the time of the Scroll's creation. It can then be read by other players to add the knowledge to their exploration progress.

## Exploration

When a world is first generated, the Map will be black except for the area immediately surrounding the **character**. As the world is explored, the map will be filled in. Generally, everything that can be seen on the screen will be added to the map as it comes into view, except for the corners which are slightly out of range. To be sure something is added, try to get at least half a screen away from it.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, Seagulls replace Snowbirds, in that they will drop the same type of feather. Seagulls can be encountered at the Ocean. Seagulls are the only birds that appear, spawning on the ground with no Turf instead of the Ocean during Hurricane Season. Unlike any other birds, Seagulls are omnivores. They can eat food left on the ground and Ocean. During Hurricane Season, they can pick Limpet Rocks, too. They fly down from off-screen and peck the ground for a few moments, then fly away. When they take flight, there is a chance that Seeds are left behind. Birds will also be attracted to Seeds left on the ground. If the player or most other mobs get too close, birds will be frightened away. Birds won't land on Sticky Webbing and will swiftly fly away if they already lands.

When killed, birds drop a Morsel or a Feather, and all other birds nearby will fly away. They are considered innocent creatures and killing them directly adds points to the player's naughtiness level, which causes Krampus to appear. Killing a Crow adds 1 point to the player's naughtiness level while killing a Redbird or Snowbird adds 2 points to the player's naughtiness level.

In the Shipwrecked and Hamlet DLCs, Birds take 100 poison damge per interval instead of normal 2. Birds won't land on flooding tiles, and will swiftly fly away if they already lands and the flooding spreads.

## Hunting
Birds can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one. They can be Murdered by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel. Birds in the

# Lunar Baths

## Overview
The **Lunar Baths** is a [Biome](#) exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. It is completely covered in **Moon Crater Turf** and can only be found as part of the **Lunar Island** area amidst the **Ocean**.

## Flora and Fauna
### Abundant
- **Lune Tree** ![Lune Tree](Lunar Baths.png)

- **Carrat** ![Carrat](Lunar Baths.png)

### Rare

## Features
- **Saladmander**s can be found exclusively in the Lunar Baths biome. Each **Saladmander** will claim one of the multiple **Hot Spring**s present in the biome.
- **Stone Fruit Bush**es can also be found is this Biome, alongside also some **Lune Tree**s, **Lunar Saplings**, **Moon Glass** and **Celestial Fissure**.
- **Carrat** can be found planted in the ground looking like **Carrot**.

## Camping during Winter
The Lunar Baths is a good place to set up camp during **Winter**, as the Hot Springs can provide the players with heat, and light when **Bath Bombed**, and the long nights will ensure that **Enlightenment** is kept down, just be sure to keep an eye on when the full moon occurs as Bath Bombed Hot Springs will turn to glass, losing the light and heat for a couple of days.

## Trivia
- The Lunar Baths was introduced in the **Turn of Tides** update.

# Small Casserole Dish

- **Dropped By**: ![Oven Kit](Oven%20Kit.png)
- **Spawn Code**: `quagmire_casseroledish_small`
- **Exclusive to**: Don't Starve Together
- **Event**: The Gorge

The Small Casserole Dish is used to bake various dishes, primarily breads, desserts, and other dishes that can fit on a plate. It can be obtained from the Oven Kit and has 3 ingredient slots.

## Usage

The small casserole dish can be placed into an oven. Lighting a fire in the oven will begin the baking process for the food within the dish. The cooking time depends on the flame's intensity and whether [Wolfgang] is standing next to the oven. If the ingredients match a recipe, steam will signal that the dish is ready. Overcooking or mismatching ingredients results in gruel instead of a full dish.

# Rock Lobsters

**Rock Lobsters** are neutral **Mobs** found in **Caves**. They eat all **Minerals** except for **Marble**, all of which can be given to them to befriend them. They grow over time, slowly regenerate their health, and come in a variety of colors. They are also immune to the freezing effect of the **Ice Staff**.

## Behavior

**Rock Lobsters** are slow-moving and live in herds. They repopulate and grow over time every 4 days; while they do so, their size, **Health**, and damage output increase. They roam around and attempt to eat nearby minerals, only fighting when they are provoked. When attacked, **Rock Lobsters** hide by mimicking large stones. While hiding, their stone shells gain 95% **Damage Reduction** and regenerate 10 Health per second.

Like **Pigs**, **Rock Lobsters** can be convinced to follow and fight for the character when given any minerals such as **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Gold Nuggets**, or **Gems**; however, they only follow for about 3 minutes (6 segments), regardless of the type of mineral given. Each additional mineral fed to a **Rock Lobster** will increase the loyalty time by another 6 segments, up to a maximum of 40 segments, or 2.5 days.

**Rock Lobsters** will go to sleep after spending 2 days awake. A sleeping **Rock Lobster** will awaken after half a day of sleep. Time of day or light does not affect their sleeping habits. A **Rock Lobster** may also be put to sleep with the **Pan Flute** or with three **Sleep Darts**.

The **Rock Lobster** regenerates 10 HP per second while in camouflage.

**Rock Lobsters** cannot be brought to the surface, which was the case in **Don't Starve**.

## Hunting

**Rock Lobsters** have high health and protect themselves from damage. They also live in herds and will defend each other when necessary. Additionally, their health slowly regenerates. All of this taken together means that **Rock Lobsters** are very difficult to kill. When possible, it's a good idea to separate one from the group before fighting it, or use ranged weapons since they are slow-moving, which allows for multiple hits in a short time.

Also an effective way to kill the **Rock Lobster** is to kite: hit it and run out of its range before it can hit back. It is also noted that while a **Rock Lobster** is sleeping, one can kill it with **Gunpowder** or **Slurtle Slime**, as once lit, those explosives will deal large amounts of damage to groups of sleeping **Rock Lobsters**, and they will not wake up and aggro the player. 9 Gunpowder can easily take out a fully grown **Rock Lobster**.

However, due to their incredibly high health, regeneration, damage absorption, and abysmal drops for the effort it would take to kill a **Rock Lobster**, it is almost never worth it to kill them, and even if you need them dead, leading them to hostile monsters would be a much better idea, as you'll get extra monster loot along with the death of the **Rock Lobsters**.

## Shadow Rift Content

If it gets caught in the **Acid Rain** its will shrink in size and become weaker. After the rain stops, they will slowly return.

## Tips

- **Rock Lobsters** can take out most giants with little to no effort. Having high health and damage, regenerative abilities, and immunity to fire and ice, they are a good solution to any boss in the game, especially the **Ancient Guardian**.
- A group of **Rock Lobsters** can easily take out a herd of mating **Beefalo** if left unsupervised. However, one or two **Rock Lobsters** will easily be stopped by a large herd, as they will be hit too often to come out of hiding.
- A **Dragonfly** will kill **Rock Lobsters** within a few hits, and her AoE attack is particularly devastating. While this makes **Rock Lobsters** unreliable in a fight against the giant, a player can use a Dragonfly to quickly reduce their **Rock Lobster** numbers in the event of overpopulation.
- When directing **Rock Lobster** followers to attack a target, one should be careful not to accidentally click on one of the **Rock Lobsters** themselves or else they (and any other **Rock Lobsters** in the vicinity) will start to fight each other and could end up in a nearly endless brawl, unable to be controlled or attack hostile mobs.

## Trivia

- **Rock Lobsters** were added into the game during the **It's Not a Rock!

- **Wanda:** "I like to keep a bit of candy in my pocket at all times"

## Recipe
To create Jellybeans, combine at least 1 Royal Jelly and 3 fillers (excluding Inedibles and Monster Foods) in a Crock Pot. This produces 3 Jellybeans.

## Examples
- **Recipe 1:** Royal Jelly + Honey x3
- **Recipe 2:** Royal Jelly + Pomegranate + Watermelon + Cave Banana
- **Recipe 3:** Royal Jelly + Ice x3
- **Recipe 4:** Royal Jelly + Morsel x3

## Tips
- Jellybeans are a good upgrade to common healing foods such as Pierogi or healing items such as the Bat Bat and Healing Salves, as each Bee Queen kill yields between 2160 to 3240 HP worth of jellybeans depending on if the crown is deconstructed or not.
- Wormwood is capable of healing from Jellybeans, minus the first small initial health bonus.
- Jellybeans can be seasoned by Warly, creating useful buff consumables that do not spoil.

## Trivia
- Jellybeans were added in the "Cute Fuzzy Animals" update.
- Jellybeans are the only Crock Pot dish that yield in sets of more than one.
- If a player consumes Jellybeans and drowns, despawns or dies, the healing effect will remain after they spawn again.

# Pig Village

A **Pig Village** is a settlement of [Pigs] and 5-9 [Pig Houses]. Sometimes there are [Carrots], [Flowers], [Grass Tufts], and [Berry Bushes] in farms of nine, fewer if the amount of those plants (other than Flowers) has been tweaked for [Sandbox Mode]. Some villages may also spawn with [Merm Heads].

Pig Villages usually spawn in a [Grassland] biome close to a [Forest] biome, though they rarely spawn in other biomes such as [Rockyland] or [Savanna].

| World size | Number of villages |
|------------|--------------------|
| default    | 1-3                |
| medium     | 1-3                |
| large      | 2-3                |
| huge       | 2-5                |

## Pig King Village

In the world always spawns one Pig King Village in [Deciduous Forest/DST|Deciduous Forest]. [Glommer's Statue] also usually spawns not far from the pig king village. Pig King Village is a normal pig village with the exception that a [Pig King] appears there on [Wooden Flooring] with 8 [Obelisks].

A [Cobblestones|Cobblestone] [Road] will usually lead to a Pig Village but there is a chance that it might not.

## Other Associated Structures

* In the [Caves], there is a special type of house ([Rabbit Hutch]) that [Bunnymen] live in.
* In [Marsh] biome, the Pig Houses and the Pigs are replaced with [Rundown House]s and [Merm]s.

# Military Biome

## Overview
The Military Biome is found in the Ruins. The entrance to this biome always has a single island with a spiral pattern of Runic Turfs, at the center of which is a single Ancient Statue. This biome is very similar to the Sacred biome, but can readily be identified by its turf, which is mostly Cave Rock Turf. Another difference is that this area also has numerous Broken Clockworks spread out across the entire biome, which will pose a constant threat unless dealt with.

## Features
- **Abundant**: 
  - Ancient Statue
  - Wall
  - Nightmare Light
  - Relic
  - Broken Clockworks (three types)
  - Damaged Bishop
  - Damaged Rook
  - Damaged Knight
- **Occasional**: None mentioned
- **Rare**: Ancient Pseudoscience Station, Cave Hole (Ancient Chest, Don't Starve Together icon)

## Quote
> "It may contain something fantastic! Or horrible." - Wilson

## Details
Numerous Ancient Statues and Nightmare Lights can be found in this area, and Dangling Depth Dwellers are also quite common. Flintless Boulders can be found in this biome.

This is one of the only two biomes where the Ancient Pseudoscience Stations can be found.

# Dirt

![Dirt Texture](Dirt_Texture.png)

## Perk
- **Can be replaced by any Turf**

Dirt is a type of surface that can be found under any type of [[Turf]]. You can't use a [[Pitchfork]] on it. When you use [[Pitchfork]]s on the majority of surfaces, they will drop a kind of [[Turf]] as an item and Dirt will appear under it instead. Dirt can be replaced by any [[Turf]] item. It also can be found near [[Sinkhole]]s.

The Grass Gator is a mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together and introduced in the Waterlogged beta. They function similarly to the Beefalo, but spawn from Great Tree Trunks. When killed, Gators drop 2 Cut Grass, 2 Twigs, and 7 Leafy Meat. The Great Tree Trunk will respawn a new Grass Gator in about 2 minutes.

### Behavior
Grass Gators do not live in herds, however nearby Grass Gators will also attack if one of them is harmed. They are unable to be befriended and run away from the player, similar to a Koalefant. If they enter any water deeper than shallow, they will dive under the water and emerge back in the Waterlogged biome, producing waves.

Grass Gators will drop one Twig every half a day, making them an automatic source of twigs if they are telelocated to a pen for easier gathering, similar to a Grass Gekko farm.

### Trivia
- The old, unused version of the Grass Gator was first found in the Don't Starve: Newhome beta files.
- According to Rhymes With Play #282, the Grass Gator is related to the Grass Gekko.
- According to the same RWP, Grass Gators live in the Great Tree's canopy but, due to their natural clumsiness, they tend to fall from it.

### Bugs
- Grass Gator do not sleep at night when located 40 unit near its Great Tree Trunk.
- Due to a logical error in line 129 of Grassator.lua (Compare two strings), the Grass Gator will judge the Middle and deep seas as shallow when diving, and will therefore move in an almost random direction.

## Tips
- Deadly Brightshades and Tunneling Vines do not drop Souls for Wortox.
- Long-distance weapons like Blow Darts or Walter's Trusty Slingshot can damage the main plant without retaliation.
- The Brightshade Staff with the Brightshade Helm and the Howlitzer are more effective ranged weapons once the resources have been acquired.
- The retaliation effect of the main plant can harm any mob nearby, potentially turning aggressive mobs against the Deadly Brightshade.
- The Brightshade deals a large amount of armor-piercing/planar damage, making them very dangerous for characters with low HP.
- The Brightshade Armor set can be obtained after defeating a few Deadly Brightshades, which can drastically reduce the damage they do along with partially piercing their planar entity protection with the Brightshade Sword.
- A full stack of 40 gunpowder is not enough to instantly kill a Deadly Brightshade due to planar entity protection increasing in effectiveness with stronger hits.

## Trivia
- Deadly Brightshades were introduced in the

# World Generation

World generation is the process that generates the layout and contents of the world. The general flow of how a world generation run goes is:

## General Flow
1. For a given **Preset**, **Tasks** are selected; some mandatory, and a few optional ones.
2. Each task generates a set of **Rooms**, and then linked together.
3. Tasks get linked together based on **Locks** and **Keys**. Tasks that don't get a key for each of their locks get discarded.
4. Background rooms are added to each task.
5. Set pieces (both mandatory and optional) and teleportato pieces get assigned to rooms.
6. The world generates a spatial arrangement from the graph, and converts it to tiles.
7. Fixes islands in caves, and checks that rooms have enough space (restarting if not).
8. Entities are added at each of the nodes, and roads are drawn, avoiding certain rooms.

## Presets

Each world generation preset has a different configuration that causes different contents. **Caves**, **Ruins**, and **Adventure Mode** levels have their own presets as well. Each preset is composed of **Tasks** (some mandatory, some optional) and **Set Pieces**.

- Survival (Don't Starve)
- Survival (Don't Starve: Reign of Giants)
- Survival (Don't Starve Together)
- Caves
- Ruins
- Adventure Mode: A Cold Reception (RAINY)
- Adventure Mode: King of Winter (WINTER)
- World Generation Screen: The Game is Afoot (HUB)
- Adventure Mode: Archipelago (ISLANDHOP)
- Adventure Mode: Two Worlds (TWOLANDS)
- Adventure Mode: Darkness (DARKNESS)
- Adventure Mode: Checkmate (ENDING)

## Tasks

**Tasks** are written like "story elements"—overall goals for what the world should have. Each task specifies **Locks**, **Keys**, a selection of **Rooms** (including how many of each room can occur), and a background **turf**, which determines what entities are **not** allowed there (e.g. no grass in a task with a rocky background).

## Rooms

**Rooms** are small biomes that contain certain contents; there are several rooms for each biome type, producing variation in the types of biomes encountered (for example, bee lands with or without killer beehives). When a **Room** is generated, a set of **Nodes** are created as well, spaced out from each other to ensure that objects in the room are distributed relatively evenly. **Rooms** specify **Tags**, specific numbers of certain entities, and probabilities for other entities to spawn at a given **Node**, and have a particular turf (or **Mosaic**, a random mixture of most turfs).

## Locks and Keys

**Locks** and **Keys** specify how tasks can be connected to each other. Each **Key** can unlock one or more **Locks**. When linking the tasks together, it will try to add a task such that the tasks so far have keys for each of the new task's locks. However, if this is not possible, it will add a task at random, so the lock-and-key system is just used for prioritizing tasks. Tasks added later are more likely to be at edges of the world, and these will usually require keys provided by the center of the world.

## Tags

**Tags** are attached to rooms in order to mark them for the addition of certain special objects that require more attention than simply being spawned. For example, tags handle mazes in the **Ruins**, mark areas as not being allowed to have **Road**s, requiring extra or less connectivity with surrounding areas, being able to have the **Eye Bone**, or for certain kinds of wormholes.

## Detailed Generation Description

1. A **Preset** is used.
2. The **Tasks** are chosen for the world; all of the required tasks, and a random selection of the specified number of optional tasks (four of them for normal worlds).
3. A certain number of random set pieces (five for normal worlds) are assigned to random tasks.
4. For the mandatory set pieces, the specified number are each attached to one of the tasks they're allowed to attach to (specified in the preset data).
5. For each **Task** in the preset, a graph of **Task Nodes** is created.
6. Starting with one of the **Rooms** (an "entrance room" if specified by the task, sometimes with a probability, otherwise a room at random), it compiles a list of rooms, including duplicates as specified by the task.
7. While there are rooms left to choose from, it removes a room from the list and generates its contents, attaching it to the last generated room in a (

## Description
When cutting down a fully sized Birchnut Tree that drops Birchnuts from day 3 and after, there is a small chance that other Birchnut Trees in the area will "awaken" and begin attacking anything in the area, unless it is Winter. This chance increases with the number of days survived from 3% on day 3 to 33% on day 70. After enough time passes (minimum one day), Poison Birchnut Trees will calm down and return to their normal state. The player can also plant Birchnuts nearby to attempt to pacify them.

A Poison Birchnut Tree can spawn up to 5 Birchnutters to attack the player or nearby Mobs. They will also do a root attack, behaving similarly to tentacles, that will attempt to home in on the player's position.

Unlike the somewhat similar Treeguards, Poison Birchnut Trees have to be felled with an Axe (18 chops) or any other method that will destroy the average tree. Torching a Poison Birchnut Tree spawns another, final wave of Birchnutters.

A Poison Birchnut Tree will drop 1 Living Log and 3 Birchnuts and has a 20% chance to drop an additional Living Log or Nightmare Fuel. Its stump can also be dug up to yield an additional Living Log.

## Tips
- It is advised to bring a group of befriended Pigs when chopping Birchnut Trees. As soon as a Poison Birchnut Tree is spawned, the allied Pigs will attempt to chop it down as well as fight the Birchnutters.
- If left for a while (but not too long), Poison Birchnut Trees will stop attacking and spawning Birchnutters, making them safer to chop down.
- Mobs like the Bearger and Clockwork Rook will cut down Poison Birchnut Trees as easily as regular trees, making them especially effective for farming Living Logs.
- The Weather Pain is a good tool to dispose of Poison Birchnut Trees due to its long-range tree-chopping abilities.
- In the Hamlet DLC, Birchnut Seeds only cost one Oinc, therefore one can use surplus Oincs to plant a Birchnut Tree farm, the more seeds are bought and planted, the more likely the player is to get the attention of a Poison Birchnut Tree upon chopping a Birchnut Tree down.

## Trivia
- In the first version of Reign of Giants, Birchnut Trees were simply named "Deciduous Trees". It's still named as such in the game's

# Monster Foods

> "Ugh. I don't think I should eat that." - Wilson

![Monster Food](Monster Food.png)

Monster Foods are **Food Items** which have a monster food value, meaning they will create **Monster Lasagna** when more than one is used in a **Crock Pot**, except when **Twigs** are added as an ingredient or another recipe with higher **priority** matches the ingredients used.

Monster Foods are typically poisonous and cause damage to **Health** and **Sanity** when eaten; however, these effects can be lessened by **cooking** them. **Webber** does not suffer the Health and Sanity penalty when eating any Monster Foods. Eating 4 Monster Meat of any type or Monster Lasagna will also cause **Pigs** to be transformed into **Werepigs**. There are 2 basic Monster Food items in-game (3 in the Shipwrecked DLC).

Because Monster Meat, Cooked Monster Meat, and Monster Jerky are considered **Meat** and Durian and Extra Smelly Durian **Fruit**, putting only one in a Crock Pot to cook will create a normal dish, depending on the other ingredients used. Jellyfish and all of its associated products are considered **fish** as their secondary type. Using Monster Meat in this way renders it safe to eat.

| Living | Dead/Raw | Cooked | Dried | DLC | Food value |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|-----|------------|
| N/A     | N/A      | Monster Meat | Cooked Monster Meat | Monster Jerky | Meats x1.0 |
| N/A     | N/A      | Durian | Extra Smelly Durian | N/A | Fruits x1.0 |
| Jellyfish | Dead Jellyfish | Cooked Jellyfish | Dried Jellyfish | Shipwrecked | Fish x1.0 |

## Crock Pot Meals that require Monster Foods

| Food | Name | DLC | Health | Hunger | Sanity | Perish time (days) | Cook time (sec) | Priority | Recipe |
|------|------|-----|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|----------------|----------|---------|
| Jelly-O Pop | Jelly-O Pop | Shipwrecked | +20 | +12.5 | 0 | 3d | 10s | 20 | Jellyfish, Ice, Twigs |
| Monster Lasagna | Monster Lasagna | -20 | +37.5 | -20 | 6d | 10s | 10 | Monster Food x2.0 | No Twigs |
| Monster Tartare | Monster Tartare | Shipwrecked | +3 | +37.5 | +10 | 10d | 20s | 30 | Monster Foods x2.0, Eggs x1.0, Vegetables x0.5 | Cooked in Portable Crock Pot |
| Monster Tartare | Monster Tartare | Don't Starve Together | -20 | +62.5 | -20 | 10d | 10s | 30 | Monster Foods x2.0 | Cooked in Portable Crock Pot, No Twigs |

## Trivia

* There was another Monster Food called **Deadly Feast**. It has since been removed from the game, but it is still available to spawn by using its **DebugSpawn code**. Eating it will instantly bring the character's health to 0, though it acts like a regular Monster Food for Pigs.
* Jellyfish is unique among monster food as it does not deduct health or sanity from the player, even if eaten raw. It however, still counts as monster food in Crock Pot definitions.
* Adding 2 or more Monster Food items into a Crock Pot will usually result in Monster Lasagna, because of its high priority. But when cooking **Surf 'n' Turf** there is no limit to how many Monster Food Items can be added, this because of that the Surf 'n' Turf takes priority over Monster Lasagna. This allows the player to use 3 Monster Food Items in a Crock Pot while making Surf 'n' Turf. Although only 2 of these can be Monster Meat, because of the recipes restrictions.

## Description
The **Sacred** Biome is found in the **Ruins**. It is always found connected to the far end of the **Labyrinth**. It is very similar in nature to the **Military** biome, but can be easily identified because the area is almost entirely covered in a purple **Runic Turf**, except for a few features that use dark and light runic turf.

Numerous **Ancient Statues** and **Nightmare Lights** can be found in this area. Many **Broken Clockworks** can be found as well, but they tend to be found in tight groups in subsections known as "barracks". This also means that the various **Damaged Clockworks** are found concentrated around the barracks as well.

This is one of only 2 biomes that can contain **Ancient Pseudoscience Stations**, and the only one that can contain one that is already fully repaired. The fully repaired Station will be found only on patches of light runic turf.

## Don't Starve Together
In **Don't Starve Together**, the **Ancient Chest** can be found next to a fully repaired **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**.

## Treeguards Description

Treeguards are Boss Monsters that can occasionally transform from Evergreens when a nearby Evergreen is chopped down. They are initially hostile towards the wood-cutter, assuming that is how they were spawned, have very high health and damage, and are capable of killing most unarmored characters in three strikes. They can be pacified by planting new trees nearby.

## Behavior

When one appears, a Treeguard aims to attack whoever chopped down a tree near them, and follows them limitlessly, only stopping when several new trees are planted nearby. Planting a Pine Cone within 16 units has a 15% chance to calm them, and within 5 units away has a 33% chance. Treeguards growl every time a pine cone is planted, even if they're sleeping.

The moment a Treeguard is pacified, it returns to the ground disguised as an ordinary tree, as if it were asleep. A Treeguard in this state does not wave in the wind, does not have a trunk, and does not appear on the Map. During Winter, sleeping Treeguards also don't have snow, making them easy to distinguish from actual trees.

At night, neutral Treeguards go to sleep, plopping down wherever they happen to be standing. If no one chops a nearby tree or attacks the sleeping Treeguard, it will not wake up until morning comes. At day, neutral Treeguards wander aimlessly until night comes or until they are angered again. Neutral Treeguards can still be put to sleep with pine cones.

A Treeguard being asleep does not stop Mobs from deciding to attack it. Pigs, Abigail, and other friendly mobs must be kept in check, as they will draw aggression from any Treeguard they hit, although the Treeguard will focus its attention on those that attack it.

If an angered Treeguard doesn't growl when the player plants Pine Cones, it's not being done close enough. Planting trees ahead of time does not prevent Treeguards from spawning, nor does it calm them later. Attempting to chop down a tree within 20 units of any neutral Treeguard enrages it again, though planting more trees can calm it again too. It's even possible to calm a Treeguard after directly attacking it.

There are three sizes available for Treeguards — short (70% scale), normal (100% scale), and tall (125% scale) — that spawn from Evergreens of respective sizes. A Treeguard's health, damage, combat range, and walking speed all scale with its size.

Treeguards do not come from dead Evergreens,




# Obelisks

## Description

Obelisks are indestructible structures usually found surrounding the Pig King in Survival Mode, but also act as an indicator of the Sanity level of a player. When the Sanity level is 15% and below, the Obelisks around the Pig King change their states: the lowered ones raise, and the raised ones become lowered. The Shadow Creature Mr. Skitts briefly appears to raise and lower the Obelisks.

### Usage

In Adventure Mode, Obelisks act as road barriers, and can be great for many defensive ideas. However, it will be hard to deal with, as one might have to eat a load of raw Green Caps to lower their Sanity and Cooked Green Caps to raise their Sanity, and it would take a while to defend against something, like Hounds.

If two players are nearby an Obelisk with varying sanity, the Obelisk will prioritize the player with unfit conditions. For example, if there lay a barrier of Insanity Obelisks and there's a player with 0% Sanity and another with >15% Sanity, the Obelisk will continue to block both players until the player with >15% Sanity has either lowered their Sanity or left the vicinity.

In A New Reign, the Atrium Biome was added to the Ruins. Insanity Obelisks block the main paths that lead from the Tentapillar all the way to the Ancient Gateway. There also lay Ornate Chests, all of which are blocked behind Sanity Obelisks - barriers that open only for the sane. Players must be careful around the previously mentioned Obelisks since they can act as impenetrable barriers if they do not have items to raise their Sanity.

### Quotes

- **Wilson**: TAKE THAT, SANE SELF!

- Sometimes a Grass Tuft will spawn on an Obelisk, making it impossible to harvest.
- The image in the fourth William Carter Puzzle includes what looks like a drawing of blueprints for an Obelisk.

## Shadow Puppets

The **Shadow Puppets** are shadow versions of [[Maxwell/Don%27t_Starve_Together|Maxwell]] that do his bidding. In **Don't Starve Together**, shadow puppets are divided into two types - the **Shadow Servant** and the **Shadow Duelist**. They are summoned by **Codex Umbra** and take 15% of Maxwell's maximum sanity per summon. Shadow puppets can be called at a specific location and do not leave the area within a four-turf cell radius of the summoning location. They automatically begin activities appropriate to their functions. You can have a maximum of 6 puppets summoned at the same time, although it is best to summon only 5 to prevent shadow creatures from spawning, unless you intend to farm nightmare fuel or have the bone helm.

### Shadow Servant
![Shadow Servant](Shadow_Puppet.png)

- **Health**: 4 Minutes
- **Run Speed**: 6
- **Spawn Code**: `shadowworker`
- **Special Ability**: Can chop, mine, dig, harvest, and pick up items.
- **Spawn From**: **Codex Umbra** for **Sanity Decrease** (15%)

The **Shadow Servant** is a worker capable of chopping, mining, digging, harvesting, and picking up items. For 4 minutes after being spawned, the servant will collect resources within four turfs radius of the spawn point. Shadow servants have one inventory slot, and will pick up items up to its max stack size within the range before returning them to the summoner. The items that Shadow Servant can pick and cannot pick are the same as [[The Lazy Forager/DST|The Lazy Forager]]. For example, Shadow Servant will not pick up weapons or [[Blueprint]]s.

While working, the Servants only use the worst efficiency tools, meaning they need 15 hits of Axe to chop down a fully grown tree. When cutting down trees, the servant will also dig up the remaining stump. The Shadow Servants will not collect from Scared plants that are caused by [[Embalming Spritz]] and [[Surprising Seed|Ancient Trees]].

When Shadow Servant is summoned on the **Boat**, it will set the boat as its spawn point and stay on the Boat, even when Boat is moving. The Servants are able to walk on the **Ocean** and pick up items on the Ocean.

The Shadow Servant can be summoned to pick up items that Maxwell cannot reach, like the items in **Cave Hole**. They can also pick **Cactus** or **Spiky Bush** without taking any damage.

However, they will run away from hostile mobs and bosses and cannot pick up items around threats. Once attacked, the Servants will disappear in one hit. Maxwell can also force attack them to dismiss the Servants.

### Shadow Duelist
![Shadow Duelist](Shadow_Duelist_(mob).png)

- **Health**: 75 (2 Minutes)
- **Damage**: 20 
- **Attack Period**: 1.8 (2.8 if far from the owner) 
- **Attack Range**: 
- **Run Speed**: 6
- **Spawn Code**: `shadowprotector`
- **Spawn From**: **Codex Umbra** for **Sanity Decrease** (15%)

The **Shadow Duelist** will attack any creature that approaches their summon range, as well as anything that the summoner attacks, or anything that attacks the summoner; however, the shadow duelists are not able to attack **Shadow Creatures**, like the crawling horror. The duelist has 75 health, and 20 base damage which various modifiers can increase. The duelists will disappear after 2 minutes, but if they are not actively engaging in combat, they will die in 10 seconds.

The duelist has two types of attacks: normal strike and dash. The dash has a cooldown of 8 seconds and deals 1.5 times the damage of the normal strike. If the summoner is not within the summon range of the duelist, the dash cooldown is increased to 16 seconds.

Even though the duelist has only 75 health, it is still durable in combat due to its damage reduction. From the time of summoning, the damage that another creature can inflict on them is limited to a value of 15 HP, which increases by 5 HP every 2.5 seconds if the duelists don't take damage. This means that damage taken will be equal to the duelist's total health in 30 seconds.

When taking a hit, duelists disappear and appear nearby, similar to crawling horrors.

#### Damage Modifiers
The duelist's initial damage is 20 but can be increased with Maxwell's equipped items. The item level is multiplied by four

# Forging Hammer

- **Damage**: 20
- **Perk**: User hits a spell-circle-sized area, stunning and doing 30 damage to anything inside. (Anvil Strike makes all hit mobs aggro on user. Classified as electric damage.)
- **Equip Slot**: Hands
- **Spawn Code**: "hammer_mjolnir"
- **Exclusivity**: Don't Starve Together
- **Event**: The Forge

The **Forging Hammer** is an item added to **[The Forge](#)** in Don't Starve Together. Available immediately from strength-based characters such as **Wolfgang**, **WX-78**, and **Winona**.

## Description

This item is a melee weapon. During the normal hammer attack, a character deals 20 damage to the target. At the same time, an attacked target has a broken shield icon above their head - a sign that their defense has been broken, and 5-10% more damage is dealt to them. Basic attacks deal physical damage.

The main ability of the Forging Hammer is **Anvil Strike**. When used, it creates a small field where the character jumps, dealing 30 electrical damage to all enemies in an area and provoking them to attack the offender. Also, the enemies are in a stationary state for some time after the impact, playing the animation of receiving an electric shock and not reacting to anything. Thus, during this time, they cannot attack and move for one second. This ability is capable of causing Swinefish and Grunts to come out of the shield.

## Tips

* The ability to break through enemy armor is very important in the Crucible. Players without a hammer are advised to focus on the target that the player with the hammer is attacking. But the player with the hammer should also attack those whom the rest of the team has already chosen to attack.
* When fighting grunts and pigs, it's best to save your primary ability to break through their block. It is better to cooperate with the rest of the team, in what order who will do it, so as to not spend 2 main abilities at once.
* Since hitting the anvil deals electrical damage, WX-78 will deal double the damage of 60 with this ability.
