# Crafting

Crafting is an in-game mechanic that allows players to craft or make Items and Structures. This is done by selecting an item or structure to be crafted in one of the 19 Crafting Tabs (including DLCs, and Character-Specific tabs). Provided the player has sufficient materials in their inventory and, if necessary, has unlocked the item recipe, they will receive 1 or more of the crafted item. Below are the crafting tables for the different game modes available. The availability of crafting recipes are further affected by special Events.

## Unlocked

Unlocking for the first time will grant the player 15 Sanity. Once unlocked, items can be crafted any time.

### Prototype

Generally, each Item or Structure must be "prototyped" at a particular Prototyper or through other means to be unlocked. Once the item has been unlocked, it can be crafted anywhere, anytime (so long as the required materials are available). Tier 1 items can be unlocked at either a Science Machine or Alchemy Engine. Tier 2 items can only be unlocked at an Alchemy Engine, ETC.

Standing near the Prototyper allows prototyping new recipes. The following is a list of all the Prototypers:

- Science Machine
- Alchemy Engine
- Prestihatitator
- Shadow Manipulator
- Bookcase
- Think Tank
- Tackle Receptacle
- Terra Firma Tamper
- Sawhorse

### Blueprint

### Webber's Switcherdoodle

## Crafting Station

Crafting Station is similar to Prototyper, except that they do not unlock the recipe for the player after they make it, so the player must return to Crafting Station if they want to make the item again.

The following is a list of all the Crafting Station:

- Ancient Pseudoscience Station
- Cartographer's Desk
- Potter's Wheel
- Rock Den
- Celestial Orb
- Celestial Altar
- Celestial Tribute
- Celestial Sanctum
- Brightsmithy
- Shadowcraft Plinth
- Portable Grinding Mill
- Benevolent Rabbit King
- Masonry Oven
- Mad Scientist Lab
- Gobbler Shrine
- Varg Shrine
- Pig Shrine
- Carrat Shrine
- Beefalo Shrine
- Catcoon Shrine
- Bunnyman Shrine
- Dragonfly Shrine
- Trinket Trove Filter
- Cawnival Creation Filter

## Crafting Filter

In Don't Starve Together, the Crafting menu has been redesigned to accommodate more items, with filters replacing categories.

### Unimplemented Filters

Unimplemented Filters - Filter that are unused in the game and founded in game files

## Don't Starve Together Quick-Craft Tabs

In Don't Starve Together, the crafting sidebar UI has been redesigned into Quick-Craft Tabs which allow the player to quickly craft items and structures. The player can use up to 9 pages of quick-craft tabs, with each page holding up to 9 recipes maximum. Keybinds can be set to quickly page left and right between pages. Moreover, mouse-wheeling over a particular tab changes the Belongings skin of that item or structure.

## Craftable Items and Structures

## Tips

* Whenever an item is unlocked, the player's Sanity will be restored by 15 points. This is only when prototyping the item and not during subsequent construction of that item. Therefore, a very simple tactic for healing sanity is to hold off on prototyping new items until needing the sanity.

## Trivia

* Prior to the "Hungry for your Hunger" update, the Shadow Manipulator functioned as a "level 3" crafting station. It could research all the same items as the Alchemy Engine and Science Machine before the science and magic crafting trees were separated.
* In the early beta of Don't Starve, the game used a "Research points" system instead of prototyping

## Scrapbook Info
This needs some fertilizing after planting. | Banana Bushes (Item)

## Description
Banana Bushes are Plants exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in The Curse of Moon Quay update. They can be found growing on Moon Quay and are dropped in their item form from the Unnatural Portal.

A Banana Bush will grow 1 Banana at a time after several growing stages. Similar to Berry Bushes, it can be replanted when dug up with a Shovel but will need to be fertilized before it will start growing new fruit. The bush will need to be re-fertilized after multiple harvests.

## Bugs
Despite having the MakeNoGrowInWinter() component, Banana Bushes will continue to grow during Winter.

# Combat Damage Mechanics

Combat is a gameplay mechanism that allows players or mobs to fight each other, reducing each other's health. When a player or mob is attacked or exposed to an environmental hazard, a series of calculations determine how much damage is taken and how much health is lost.

## Damage

### Physical Damage
Physical Damage is the most common type of damage in the game. Every mob, before enabling Rifts, only deals physical damage that can be absorbed by Armor's Protection or reduced by mobs' Planar Entity Protection. Physical Damage can be affected by damage multipliers, such as:

- **Wes**, **Wendy**: deal 25% less damage.
- **Wigfrid**: deal 25% more damage.
- **Wolfgang**: deal x0.75 - x2 damage, based on his mightiness.
- **Wanda**: based on her age and weapon she uses.
- **Volt Goat Chaud-Froid**: grants a x1.5 damage boost (x2.5 when target is wet) for 5 minutes.
- Dishes with **Chili Flakes**: deal 20% more damage for 4 minutes.
- **W.A.R.B.I.S. Head Gear**: gives 5% - 20% physical damage boost.

#### Weapons with Physical Damage
Almost every Weapon deals physical damage, more or less. It is recommended for players to get a **Ham Bat** or **Dark Sword** for their high damage. These weapons, however, will not be as efficient against Rift mobs with Planar Entity Protection.

### Planar Damage
Planar Damage is a new type of damage introduced in "From Beyond", and it does not get affected by the damage multipliers mentioned above. Unlike Physical Damage, Planar Damage cannot be blocked by Armor's Protection or reduced by Planar Entity Protection. It is only affected by Armor's Planar Defense or Damage Reduction.

#### Creatures with Planar Damage

| Mobs | Physical Damage | Planar Damage |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Grazer** | 50 | 10 |
| **Deadly Brightshade** | 65 (100 When attacked) | 10 (30 When attacked) |
| **Fused Shadeling** | 40 (50 {{pic|24|Fused Shadeling Bomb}}) | 10 (20 {{pic|24|Fused Shadeling Bomb}}) |
| **Shriek** | 25 | 30 |
| **Jitters** | 35 | 20 |
| **Rasp** | 20 | 20 |
| **Armored Bearger** | 87 | 30 |
| **Crystal Deerclops** | 75 | 30 |
| **Possessed Varg** | 50 (20 coldfire) | 20 |
| **Bright-Eyed Frog** | 10 | 5 |

#### Weapons with Planar Damage

| Weapons | Physical Damage | Planar Damage |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Brightshade Sword** | 38 | 30 |
| **Brightshade Bomb** | 0 | 200 |
| **Brightshade Staff** | 0 | 10 |
| **Brightshade Smasher** | 32.5 | 10 |
| **Brightshade Shoevel** | 17.2 | 10 |
| **Shadow Reaper** | 38-41.8 | 18-23 |
| **Howlitzer** | 34 | 34 |
| **Charged Elding Spear** | 74.37 (111.5 wetness) | 20 |

### Other Damage
- Damage that cannot be reduced in any way: spending Health for crafting (such as crafting a Meat Effigy).
- Damage that cannot be blocked by armor, but can be reduced by Damage Reduction:
  - Food
  - Starving
  - Freezing
  - Overheating
  - Fire
  - Acid Rain
  - Wetness (WX-78 only)
  - Lightning: including charged Volt Goat, hammering Moose/Goose Egg, and Moongleam.
- Walter takes a fixed 10 damage from Bees.

### Additional Damage Multiplier
Here are some additional damage multipliers that affect both Physical Damage and Planar Damage.

- Characters with a **Skill Tree** can choose Lunar Affinity or Shadow Affinity.
  - Lunar Affinity: +10% protection from Lunar Aligned mobs and +10% damage to Shadow Aligned mobs.
  - Shadow Affinity: +10% protection from Shadow Aligned mobs and +10% damage to Lunar Aligned mobs.
- {{Pic32|Brightshade Sword}} deals 10% more total damage to Shadow Aligned mobs.
- {{Pic32|Brightshade Helm}}

## Description

A Blueprint is an Item that lets the player learn a craftable recipe without having to prototype it first. When used, it restores 15 sanity. Blueprints themselves do not actually create an item; they only allow the player to craft the item away from the station normally used to prototype it.

Blueprints can be found in some Set Pieces and at the beginning of each world in Adventure Mode. The player can find more than one Blueprint that unlocks the same recipe, and all Blueprints will restore Sanity when used, even if the player has already researched the item.

The Bundling Wrap recipe can only be obtained from a Blueprint dropped by a Bee or Killer Bee.

## Downloadable Content

In the Reign of Giants DLC, Blueprints can also be obtained by destroying Tumbleweeds in Sandbox Mode. It is possible to find Blueprints for items in the Ancient Tab, but an Ancient Pseudoscience Station will still be needed to actually craft the item. Ancient Tab Blueprints do not restore any Sanity. The Old Bell recipe can only be obtained from a Blueprint dropped by a mined Glommer's Statue.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, Blueprints can be obtained from X Marks the Spot treasure chests.

In the Hamlet DLC, both the Vortex Cloak and Living Artifact recipes can only be obtained from Blueprints which drop from the Ancient Herald and the Large Iron Hulk, respectively.

## Trivia

- If the player uses the console to make all recipes available, all random Blueprints spawned will be called "MISSING NAME".
- There are currently 21 items that can only be researched through Blueprints, which are the Bundling Wrap, the Old Bell in Reign of Giants, the Vortex Cloak and Living Artifact in Hamlet, and the End Table, Red Funcap, Green Funcap, Blue Funcap, Glowcap, Mushlight, Napsack, Desert Goggles, Scaled Furnace, 6 Replica Relics, The Lazy Deserter, and the Strident Trident in Don't Starve Together.
- There are different console commands for each prototypical item in the game. e.g., to spawn a Blueprint for a Spear, the following command should be used: c_spawn("spear_blueprint").

- Blueprint as seen in the poster for the The End is Nigh update.

# Chess Pieces

## Overview
Chess Pieces are craftable objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. There are eight different variants that can be crafted at a **Potter's Wheel** and are mostly meant for decoration. Nearly all of them are unlocked by giving their respective **Sketch** to the Potter's Wheel, except for the Bubble Pipe Carving and the Carved Hornucopia, which are always available. Players are able to sculpt Chess Pieces out of two **Rocks** and one **Marble**, **Cut Stone** or **Moon Shard**. The chosen material determining the color of the crafted Chess Piece.

Chess Pieces can be carried by players in the chest slot, similar to **Suspicious Marble**, slowing down their movement speed and preventing them from several inventory actions, such as equipping a handheld item.

## Variants

### Carved Hornucopia
- A sculpture for a starving artist.
- Sculpture depicts a **Cornucopia**, a horn of plenty which can be depicted as a horn-shaped, hollow bread filled with food. The shape of the horn resembles a **Beefalo Horn**. The sculpture may be a reference to the fact that a Cornucopia is an over-used example of pottery.

### Bubble Pipe Carving
- Stick this on your wheel and sculpt it.
- The sculpture depicts a **Bubble Pipe** which is a toy that acts similarly to a bubble-blowing stick, except it's shaped like a tobacco pipe. The sculpture is possibly a reference to **Markus Raetz**'s pipe sculpture which can be interpreted as either a tobacco pipe or a shapeless metal blob.

### Anchor Figure
- Ground your base with a stone anchor.
- The sculpture depicts an anchor using to stop the boat. Its Sketch can be crafted in **Seafaring Filter** at **Think Tank**.

### Pawn Figure
- It takes a village to raise an army.
- The sculpture depicts a pawn from the board game **Chess**. It may be a reference to giant chess pieces.

### Rook Figure
- Next best thing to an actual castle.
- The sculpture depicts a rook from the board game **Chess**. It also bears resemblance to the nose of a **Clockwork Rook**, which when hammered during a **New Moon** can spawn a **Shadow Version** of itself (**Marble** and **Cut Stone** only). It may be a reference to giant chess pieces.

### Knight Figure
- Shining armor not included.
- The sculpture depicts a Knight from the board game **Chess**. It also bears resemblance to the head of a **Clockwork Knight**, which when hammered during a **New Moon** can spawn a **Shadow Version** of itself (**Marble** and **Cut Stone** only). It may be a reference to giant chess pieces.

### Bishop Figure
- A chesspiece with a checkered past.
- The sculpture depicts a bishop from the board game **Chess**. It also bears resemblance to a head of a **Clockwork Bishop**, which when hammered during a **New Moon** can spawn a **Shadow Version** of itself (**Marble** and **Cut Stone** only). It may be a reference to giant chess pieces.

### Queenly Figure
- The most powerful piece on the board.
- The sculpture depicts a queen from the board game **Chess**, though it appears more like a Greek tragedy actor. Its overall style and the fact that it is carrying a mask may be a reference to the Greek Muse of Tragedy, **Melpomene**.

### Kingly Figure
- Behind every queen is a dapper king.
- The sculpture depicts a king from the board game **Chess**, though it appears more like a suited man. The fact that it has no arms may be a reference to the sculpture **Venus de Milo**.

### Moon Moth Figure
- This sculpture's a moth-have.
- The sculpture depicts a **Moon Moth**. Its Sketch can be crafted in **Celestial Filter** at **Lunar Altars** or upgraded **Celestial Orb**.

### "Moon" Figure
- It's a selene figurine!
- The sculpture depicts the "Moon". Its Sketch can be crafted in **Celestial Filter** at **Lunar Altars** or upgraded **Celestial Orb**.

## Trivia
- Most Chess Pieces were added in the **Arts and Crafts** update, while the Giant Figures were introduced in an unnamed **Bonus Update** after the completion of **A New Reign**. The Bee Queen, Toadstool, Antlion, Ancient Fuelweaver, and Klaus Figures were added in the **March 2022 QoL update**.
- Based off of character quotes, it is implied that the Kingly Figure refers to

# Wickerbottom

## Character Information

- **Nickname**: The Librarian
- **Motto**: "Shhhh! No talking!"
- **Perk**: Knows many things, Self publishes books, Can't sleep, hates food spoilage
- **Health**: 150
- **Hunger**: 150
- **Sanity**: 250
- **Start Items**:
  - Birds of the World
  - Applied Horticulture
  - Sleepytime Stories
  - On Tentacles
  - The End is Nigh
  - Joy of Volcanology (Shipwrecked)
- **Start Items**: Papyrus ×2
- **Spawn Code**: `wickerbottom`

## Description
Wickerbottom is the fifth playable Character in Don't Starve that can be unlocked via Experience, with 1280 XP, and one of the playable Characters in Don't Starve Together (DST). She is an old, intelligent librarian who self-publishes and is able to identify many different types of fauna and flora by their scientific names.

## Origin
Wickerbottom's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled [One For the Books](https://youtu.be/15ESUxxJvZs). An official summary of the short was provided in DST's Compendium:

"When people meet Ms. Wickerbottom, most assume that what you see is what you get. She certainly looks every bit the typical librarian that she claims to be, as at home amongst the bookstacks as any creature in their native habitat. Nobody would raise an eyebrow at such a person being well-versed in a wide range of subjects. Who would spare a second thought if, upon further inquiry, her knowledge rivaled that of experts? And obviously, no one would think of questioning what a librarian might be involved in after hours, when the library doors are closed to the public...."

## Trivia
### In-Game
- Wickerbottom was added to Don't Starve in the Progress! update on January 29, 2013.
- Wickerbottom is played by an oboe.
- Wickerbottom's eyes are shut by default, but open sometimes, like when she exits a Worm Hole or is low on Sanity.
  - In DST, Wickerbottom is able to be put to sleep by a Pan Flute in PVP mode or by Bearger's yawn. Due to this, players are able to see that Wickerbottom sleeps with her eyes open, most likely due to her insomnia.
- While unable to sleep, Wickerbottom is still able to be knocked out by cooking a Mandrake or consuming a Cooked Mandrake.
- Wickerbottom has a skull in the game files.
- Wickerbottom's previous perk, before the Strange New Powers update, was to be able to prototype one tier higher than the other Characters, including Magic Items.
- When struck by Lightning in DLCs, Wickerbottom, like most other Characters, is shown to have bones in her hair. In addition to this, she also has bones in her skirt and shoes.
- Wickerbottom was the only female playable Character to have pupils and black, beady eyes, before Winona's release.
  - She is also the only character with separated pupils.

### Lore
- Wickerbottom's first name is unknown.
- Wickerbottom is fond of seafood, judging from her examination quotes for various fish dishes and her favorite food.
- Wilson believes that Wickerbottom has, or at least used to have, a pet cat. When Wickerbottom examines the Lucky Cat Jar, she sighs, and when she examines a Kittykit, she says "Now it feels like home.", which provides further evidence to this. This is also later confirmed in her animated short, One For the Books.
- When examining her book Birds of the World, she says that the Western screech owl is her favorite. This is also the particular bird species in The Screecher.
- She is the most literate of the Don't Starve characters and always refers to animals by their scientific names. The only exceptions to this are the creatures that are completely unknown to her. This can provide information as to what creatures in the Constant exist in her homeworld.
- She kept a garden at home, according to her quotes for a Potted Succulent ("I wonder how my garden is doing without me.") and Bloomfin Tuna ("Oh my, you'd look right at home in my old garden.").
- Wickerbottom's loading screen vignette from The Forge is accompanied by text that reveals a bit of her love of books: "Delightfully, Ms. Wickerbottom has found her passion for the written word has only deepened as the years

# Crock Pot

The **Crock Pot** is a **Structure** used to **Cooking|cook** a variety of belly-filling dishes from basic **Food**s. Found in the **Food Tab**, it requires a **Science Machine** to prototype, and costs 3 **Cut Stone**, 6 **Charcoal**, and 6 **Twigs** to build.

While enhancing **Food**'s value and efficiency; it can even make use of otherwise inedible items like **Twigs**.

## Usage

With 4 slots for ingredients, each must be filled with a piece of Food to start cooking. Most recipes take 10–20 seconds to cook (Exact times for each recipe are listed **below**). Completed Crock Pot dishes can be stacked to 40; none of them can be used in the Crock Pot again.

### Cooking basics

A cooking attempt's ingredients have to match a **Dishes#All Dishes|recipe**. There are 58 recipes available for the Crock Pot, including those from the **DLCs**. If an attempt fails to match any recipe at all, **Wet Goop** ends up as the product.

When a recipe is attempted (i.e. the pot starts cooking), the **#Food groups|food groups** the ingredients fit into are considered; almost all recipes require some amount of Food from certain food groups, but there are many recipes with specific Food requirements (like **Froggle Bunwich**).

Lots of ingredients fulfill recipe requirements more readily than others (e.g. 1 **Drumstick** has the same effect on a dish as 2 **Morsel**s). More filling ingredients tend to have greater **#Food values|food values**.

Each recipe has weight, called **#Priority|recipe priorities**, so a result can be decided when a set of ingredients fits more than one valid recipe. These weights are.

When **Food#Food Spoilage|spoiled** ingredients are used, the completed dish's spoil percentage becomes half the average spoil percentage of the ingredients (e.g. if 1 monster meat and 3 berries, all 90% spoiled (10% fresh), are placed in the Crock Pot, the resulting meatball will be 45% spoiled (55% fresh)). Non-spoilable ingredients are ignored when calculating average spoil percentage. In the vanilla game, a meal doesn't begin to spoil until a player removes it from the Crock Pot. Meals remain in the Crock Pot until either a player removes it, a **Lureplant** "eats" it, or the pot is destroyed.

## Downloadable Content

In **DLC**s, Crock Pot dishes start to **Rot|spoil** (even quicker in **rain**) before being collected. Some existing recipes gain the ability to warm or cool the player and new recipes have been added which can lower or raise the player's temperature. The Crock Pot itself also generates heat when cooking, which may **Overheating|Overheat** the player during **Summer** and **Dry Season**.

If a regular or RoG save file has been set to be compatible with SW, any recipes added by SW will also be available in such a file. Consequently, recipes such as Surf 'n' Turf can be created to easily restore large amounts of Health and Sanity in the Ruins by combining 2 Monster Meats with 2 Eels.

The **Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet** DLC introduces the first Crock Pot recipe that turns into a different recipe when it has spoiled. **Tea** will spoil after one day, but instead of becoming **Rot** it will become **Iced Tea**. Even though this transformation likely represents the cooling of the hot drink, putting Tea in an **Ice Box** will slow its spoilage like any other food item. **Foliage** can be used in the Crock Pot in this DLC.

## Tips

* The light emitted by an active Crock Pot is enough to keep **Charlie** away.
* **Warly** has his own **Portable Crock Pot**.
* Some Crock Pot dishes give fewer **Hunger** / **Health** points than the sum of their components.
  * For instance, it's better to eat four **Roasted Carrot**s (+12 **Hp** / +50 **Hunger**), versus using them to make **Ratatouille** (+3 **Hp** / +25 **Hunger**); however, most Crock Pot recipes restore 5 **Sanity**, which may be desirable.
  * Putting any 4 edible items in the pot will result in something.
* If the player has enough resources to create a 5-6 fit Crock Pot setting, the player can position them in a quintet or

# Star Caller's Staff

The **Star Caller's Staff** is a craftable [[Item]] found in the [[Ancient Tab]]. It requires 4 [[Nightmare Fuel]], 2 [[Living Log]]s, 2 [[Yellow Gem]]s, and a broken [[Ancient Pseudoscience Station]] to craft. It also can randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when damaged with a [[Hammer]], [[Gunpowder]] etc., and has a 25% chance to be found inside a [[Large Ornate Chest]]. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Star Caller's Staves cannot be prototyped and can only be made near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

With each use of the staff, the Survivor holding it will lose 20 {{sanity}} and the Staff will lose 5% of its [[Durability]] to summon a Dwarf Star. Due to the nature of [[Darkness]], the Dwarf Star cannot be summoned directly in the middle of Darkness, so more preemptive measures are needed to avoid being bitten by the Night Monster.

## Dwarf Star

### Object Infobox
- **name**: Dwarf Star
- **image**: Dwarf Star.gif
- **perk**: Provides light, heat.<br>Can cook.
- **durability**: 3.5 days
- **sanitybonus**: +25/min<br>+35/min ([[File:Willow Portrait.png|24px|link=Willow]])
- **spawnCode**: "stafflight"
- **spawnFrom**: {{pic24|Star Caller's Staff}}, {{pic|24|Ancient Pseudoscience Station}} ({{pic24|Hammer}})

When equipping the Star Caller's Staff in the hand slot, it can be used on any visible point on the ground to summon a Dwarf Star (it can also be randomly summoned by hitting an [[Ancient Pseudoscience Station]] with a hammer).

A single Dwarf Star will last 28 minutes (3.5 in-game days). With 20 uses, this means a single staff will yield a total of 70 days of Dwarf Stars. During that time it provides a fluctuating radius of light, heat equivalent to that of a 3rd tier [[Campfire]] fire (180 units; the 4th and highest tier is 220 units of heat) and a [[Sanity]] boost of 25 {{sanity}} per minute while standing near it.

The Dwarf Star can also be used to [[Cooking|cook]] [[Food]], similar to a Campfire. It can also burn flammable objects that are too close to it, so caution is advised as to where the staff is used.

## Downloadable Content

In the ''[[Reign of Giants]]'' DLC, the Dwarf Star provides the highest amount of heat instead (more than a fully fueled Fire Pit) and standing near it for too long can cause [[Overheating]], even during [[Winter]].

## Tips

* It's a good idea to equip a [[Construction Amulet]] when crafting this Staff, to save one [[Yellow Gem]].
* While the Staff cannot be used in the dark, it can still be used a few seconds before complete darkness settles in. The light given off when summoning the Dwarf Star will provide protection from [[Charlie]].
* Staying close to the Dwarf Star will cause a net bonus of 30{{sanity}}. Excluding outside factors, this results in no Sanity cost from using the Staff.
  * [[Willow]]'s Sanity regeneration perk works with the Dwarf Star too resulting in 50{{sanity}} recovered.
  * There is no limit to the amount of Dwarf Stars that players can summon at the same time and their Sanity boosts stack with each-other. This means that players can summon multiple Dwarf Stars at the same spot to boost their Character's Sanity quicker.

## Trivia

* The Star Caller's Staff was added in the ''[[Don't Starve/Version History|Hungry For Your Hunger]]'' update. Its crafting requirement was changed during the ''[[Don't Starve/Version History|Stuff of Nightmares]]'' update.

## Fire
Fire is a commonly-occurring game mechanic.

Fire is very important for various reasons. Primarily, it is used to provide light at [Night](#), which prevents [Charlie (Night Monster)](#) from attacking. Additionally, fire allows food to be [Cooking](#), increasing its [Hunger](#) and [Health](#) values. Fire also provides warmth during [Winter](#), which counteracts [freezing](#). Despite these benefits however, fire can also be dangerous, as being too close to one will drain Health.

Flaming items or objects may have different descriptions than non-burning ones; for example, a burning log versus one that's just sitting there.

### Light
There are several sources of fire which provide light. Most of these can be found in the [Light Tab](#), represented by the Campfire icon. These sources include [Campfire](#)s, [Fire Pit](#)s, [Torch](#)es, or [Star](#)s. Additionally, anything actually on fire, such as [Plants](#) or [Flammable Objects](#), will give off light as long as they are burning.

Light serves several purposes: mainly it is used to see at night, though it is also needed to prevent [Night Monster](#) from attacking. Additionally, light prevents the large [Sanity](#) loss from being in total darkness (however, it does not prevent the gradual loss caused by Dusk/Night time). If Sanity does drop too low, [Night Hand](#)s will begin to approach the fire and extinguish portions of it; eventually they may put it out completely. These hands can be scared off by stepping on them and running them towards the edge of the fire's light.

### Cooking
[Main|Cooking]  
Fire Pits, Campfires, or Stars can be used to cook foods. [Cooking](#) has various positive effects. For most foods, the amount of Hunger they restore is increased and a small Health boost is added. Eating raw [Meats](#) decreases Sanity, while cooked meats do not. Additionally, [Monster Meat], eaten raw, will reduce Health and Sanity, but these effects are lessened with cooking.

### Warmth
[Main|Freezing]  
In Winter, characters will begin to freeze if they are away from fire for too long (warm clothing helps prevent this). As long as the character is within a certain radius of a fire, they will stay warm. This includes any burning objects like trees. Fires can also warm [Thermal Stone](#)s, which can be carried around to slow down freezing.

### Fire Damage
Objects, items, and Mobs that are on fire can cause 8-12 [hp] damage per second if they are too close to the player. Most mobs will also take fire damage, when on fire, or when they are close to open fires, which can be used as an offensive tactic.

The following are immune to fire damage/being set on fire:

- Both:
  - [Willow](#)
  - [Red Hound](#)
  - [Dragonfly](#)
  - [Dragoon](#)
  - [Gnat Swarm](#)
  - [Large Iron Hulk](#)
  - [Abigail](#)
  - [Crawling Horror](#)
  - [Ghost](#)
  - [Saladmander](#)
  - [Terrorbeak](#)

- Immune to being set on fire but not fire damage:
  - [Frog](#)
  - [Houndius Shootius](#)
  - [Depths Worm](#)
  - [Tentacle](#)
  - [Big Tentacle](#)

{{Quote|I put stuff there!|Wolfgang}}
## Inventory
The **Inventory** is a section of the [[Wikipedia:User Interface|User Interface]] where the player character's held [[Item]]s are displayed and accessed during gameplay.

The player can hold up to fifteen different stacks of items in the Inventory. Equipable Items can be placed in their respective equipment slot.
![An empty Inventory bar.](Inventory Empty.PNG =414x414px)

- The first fifteen slots holds all types of items, minus [[Backpack]]s.
- The "left hand" slot allows the character to equip a [[Tools Tab|Tool]] or [[Weapon]].
- The body slot is reserved for [[Armor]], [[Clothing]] or Backpacks.
- The head slot is reserved for head Armor or hats.
- The hidden "right hand" slot is for items held directly with the player's cursor.

Using the three equip slots, one can equip Armor, Clothing, [[Weapon]]s and [[Tool]]s, applying them visually to the character. Most equipped clothing gives the character resistance to [[Freezing]] or [[Overheating]], and some restore [[Sanity]] over time. Equipped Armor absorbs a percentage of damage taken from enemy attacks and certain environmental hazards. Equipped tools are used to harvest [[Tree]]s, mine [[Boulder]]s, catch [[Fish]], destroy [[Structures]], and other functions important to survival. 
![A full Inventory. The player has equipped a [[Walking Cane]], a [[Log Suit]], and a [[Battle Helm]].](Inventory snip.PNG =414x414px)

Most equipable items have limited durability, indicated by numeric percentages displayed over their Inventory icons. These items lose durability as they are used and most are destroyed when the percentage drops to zero. [[Food#Perish Times|Perishable]] items are indicated by a colored meter in the backdrop of the slot they're held in. The meter decreases and changes color, from green, to yellow, to red as items spoil, losing their effectiveness.

Most items in the Inventory can **stack**, allowing the player to carry multiples of the same item in a single slot, leaving more space for other items. Items will stack up to 40, 20 or 10, depending on the type. Most equippable items do not stack, and some items, like [[Tallbird Eggs]], do not stack due to their unique individual uses.

## Equipable Items
Some items can be placed in equipment slots for use. Each equipped item has its own slot in which it can be placed.
| Hand Items Items ![Image](equip_slot_hud.png =32px) | Head Items Items ![Image](equip_slot_head_hud.png =32px) | Head Items Items that can be placed only on Head Slot ![Image](equip_slot_head_hud.png =32px) | Body Items Items ![Image](equip_slot_body_hud.png =32px) | Body Items Items that can be placed only on Body Slot ![Image](equip_slot_body_hud.png =32px) |

## Backpack Expansion
There are a few ways to expand how much space the player has to store items.

Wearing a [[Backpack]] allows the player 8 more slots to store items, and wearing a [[Piggyback]] gives the player access to 12 extra slots, but slows down movement speed. The [[Krampus Sack]] is a very rare drop from killing [[Krampus]] and a rare drop from the [[Loot Stash]], and gives the player 14 more slots, without a speed penalty. These three items can only be equipped in the body slot.

The [[Quality of Life]] update imports the [[Bundling Wrap]] from {{Pic24|Don't Starve Together icon}} to {{Pic24|Don't Starve icon}}. With it, players can wrap up to 4 stacks of items into [[Bundling Wrap#Bundled_Supplies|Bundled Supplies]], which only takes up one Inventory slot.

![All of the containers available to the player in [[Don't Starve]], including all DLCs.](DS_Containers_All_March.png =320px)

Some [[Structures]] can also be used to store items. They cannot be moved once they are placed, but they can be destroyed with a [[Hammer]]. The simplest form of storage structure is a [[Chest]], each of which has 9 storage slots. [[Ice Box]]es also have 9 storage slots, but they can only hold perishable items (such as Food) and [[Thermal Stone]]s.

Finding and picking up the [[Eye Bone]] will summon [[Chester]], a passive mob who will follow the player around. Chester's mouth can be opened to access 9 storage slots in his belly. The player can also transform Chester into [[Chester#Ch

## Downloadable Content
In the Hamlet DLC, Belt of Hungers can be bought for 20 Oincs at The Flying Pig Arcane Shop in Pig City, making it renewable in this DLC.

## Tips
- Because Slurpers do not respawn without regenerating the Caves with the Seed of Ruin, it's recommended to use the Sewing Kit on the Belt of Hunger to repair it rather than letting it degrade and crafting a new one.
- A single use of the Sewing Kit restores enough durability to prevent 151 points worth of hunger drain, comparable to Meaty Stew. This makes sewing a Belt of Hunger an extremely efficient way prevent starvation.
- This item is excellent for Wolfgang, as it completely nullifies his hunger problems and for Wigfrid, since her inability to eat non-Meaty foods can be very risky, especially when traveling to distant places from base.
- It's also useful for Wes and Wilbur, due to practically nullifying their increased hunger drain (when running, for the latter).

## Features

Don't Starve Together has multiple ways to play with others: LAN, network, and matchmaking play. Many items have been balanced or removed in order to keep the game fair. PvP are optional by the server operator. Dedicated, player-hosted and LAN servers are available, and chat is global or local depending on the server admin's preference.

  - We survive together, we die together!
  - Survive through the [[seasons]] and protect yourself from the world.
  - Uncover ancient secrets hidden within the shadows.
  - Grow crops, catch fish, hunt for meat. Whatever you do, don't starve.

  - Enter the world through the [[Ancient Gateway|Mossy Gateway]].
  - No nighttime.
  - Use what you can find to cook offerings for the altar!

### Playstyles

The Playstyles was added in [[A Little Drama and QOL]] update. When creating a new world, the player can choose different modes for the game. There are 5 game modes in total: Relaxed, Endless, Survival, Wilderness, and Light Out. Each mode has different settings that can later be changed in [[World Customization]].

| Playstyle   | Description                                                                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Endless    | A never-ending Don't Starve sandbox.                                                      |
| Survival   | The standard Don't Starve experience.                                                       |
| Wilderness | Players spawn in random locations across the map.                                            |
| Light Out  | A dark twist on the standard Don't Starve experience.                                       |

### Additional Content

Don't Starve Together includes almost all content of the base game and the [[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]] DLC. Some features from the [[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]] and [[Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet]] DLCs were also introduced over time. Additionally, several new entities were added to re-balance characters, giants, and seasonal mechanics for the multiplayer aspect of the game.

## Rebalancing

Don't Starve Together features [[Caves]] and [[Ruins]], which must be toggled on via a tab in the Server Creation menu. The Caves and Ruins now share the same map level, since each map level requires a separate server.

### Sleeping

Sleeping has been significantly changed. Normally, when going to sleep, the day would fast-forward to sunrise and replenish [[health]] and [[sanity]] at the cost of [[hunger]] upon waking up. However, when on a server, sleeping will not fast forward to sunrise but will instead leave the player unable to move and unaffected by the [[Charlie (Night Monster)|night monster]]. This will replenish health and sanity while draining hunger faster

## Combat

Combat is a Gameplay mechanism components allow Players or Mobs fight each other and reduces the health of each other.

### Damage Modifiers

Damage Multiplier is the most common Damage Modifier, although they are internally divided into many categories, they are not considered necessary because they are multiplicative calculations and have the same effective scope.

### Physical Damage

#### Definition

Physical Damage is the most common type of damage in the game, and its main feature is that it is absorbed by Armor's Protection.

#### Example:

Attack damage of a [Spider Queen] to a character equipped with a [Grass Suit] and a [Football Helmet] will be distributed as follows:

- 60% ＜ 80%
- 80 × 80% = 64 physical damage is absorbed by two armor
  - 64 × 60%/(80%+60%) ≈ 28 is absorbed by [Grass Suit]
  - 64 × 80%/(80%+60%) ≈ 37 is absorbed by [Football Helmet]
- (80 - 64) = 16 damage is taken by the character's [hp]     *(This is not the final health change, but multiplied by the damage reduction.)*

If it's caused by Mobs or Characters, it's affected by the all kind of Damage Modifiers they have.

Physical Damage also can be reduced by [Damage Reduction] like all kind of damage.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, the Dapper Vest can be used to craft the Hibearnation Vest.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, the Dapper Vest is not available to craft, unless it has been prototyped before in a merged base game or Reign of Giants world.

## Usage
- **Recipe:**
  - **Item 1**: Dapper Vest (1)
  - **Item 2**: Thick Fur (1)
  - **Item 3**: Rope (2)
  - **Result**: Hibearnation Vest
  - **Tool**: Alchemy Engine
  - **DLC**: Reign of Giants

## Trivia
- The Dapper Vest was added in the "The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You" update.
- The Dapper Vest requires Hound's Teeth to make because its pattern is called houndstooth. This is a pun by the developers.
- Because the Dapper Vest restores 3.3 Sanity/min and Rain drains a maximum of 3.3 Sanity/min, the Dapper Vest can be used to negate or reverse the Sanity drain of Rain.
- The Dapper Vest is one out of the two best Sanity restoring body items in the game, excluding the RoG exclusive Hibearnation Vest.
- Along with several other clothing items, the Dapper Vest used to not have any durability.

## Description
The Telebrella is a Character-exclusive Item craftable only by Wagstaff. It is found in the Tinkering Tab and requires an Electrical Doodad and a Pretty Parasol to craft. When equipped in the hand slot, a prompt to "Use Gadget" appears where the cursor is on the field, and right-clicking will teleport the character to the nearest Telipad within range.

The Telebrella has a limited range (about a half distance of map radius), meaning the player must be within a certain range of a Telipad for it to be used. If the player ventures too far away from a Telipad, they cannot teleport. The light on top of the device indicates how far away the player is from a Telipad, glowing green when close but will begin to blink and blink faster as the player gets too far away, along with a sound accompanying each blink. If the light is completely dim and makes no noise, the player is too far away and must get closer to the Telipad before it can be used.

The Telebrella can also be used as a melee weapon, but this is not recommended as it deals only 17 damage and breaks after 10 uses.

## Downloadable Content
In the DLCs, the Telebrella has a 35% Wetness protection.

## Tips
- It is impractical to build a Telelocator Focus while having access to the Telebrella (with a Telipad). Even though the Telebrella has a limited range, it's a lot cheaper to use it instead of the Telelocator Focus (The Telebrella costs an Electrical Doodad and a Pretty Parasol to craft, and a Telipad to use, while the Telelocator Focus costs 4 Nightmare Fuel, 4 Living Logs and 8 Gold Nuggets to craft, needing 3 Purple Gems and a Telelocator Staff to use it).
- If the player gets struck by lightning while equipping the Telebrella, it would force the umbrella to activate even when there aren't any Telipads present in the world, resulting in a loss of 1 use. This activation could be exploited because it can help the player teleport to the Telipad even if they aren't within range. Potentially, the player can teleport a further distance with the help of Thunderbirds to get back to base or another important place at the cost of some HP.

# Exclusivity|Don't Starve Together
![Insight](Insight.png "Insight")

Insight is an in-game point system used to progress Skill Trees for Characters in Don't Starve Together. Characters can gain Insight Points and use them to unlock unique Skills. Insight Points are awarded after a number of days survived as the character, up to 15 total points after 68 days. Insight persists between games/worlds, as it is linked to a player's account. Note that time as a Ghost Characters|Ghost does not count toward gaining Insight Points.

There are more Skills to select from than total available Insight, meaning the player must deliberate between which Skills are to be unlocked. A character's unlocked Skills are reset on joining a new world/server, and can be reset in-game via using a Moon Rock Idol on the Celestial Portal in an existing world, allowing players to unlock different skills if they wish.

## Survival

![Wilson-overheat](Wilson-overheat.png =300x)

Overheating can be overcome in two ways: by reducing the player's temperature, and by preventing player's temperature from rising rapidly. Surviving Summer or Dry Season will depend on a combination of these.

### Cooling Down

There are several ways to cool oneself down:

* An Endothermic Fire, Endothermic Fire Pit, or Moon Caller's Staff|Polar Light is a stationary light source that works like a fire, but they cool the player instead.
* A Chilled Amulet, Ice Cube, or Fashion Melon will lower temperature when worn. Note that these have different cooling values. The Ice Cube and Fashion Melon will also cause Wetness while worn, so caution is advised especially as WX-78.
* Using a Luxury Fan or Lucky Fan will lower the player's temperature instantly. The Luxury Fan has 15 uses while the Lucky Fan has 3 uses. However, when used, they put out fires, so the player should be wary around light sources.
* Equipping the Whirly Fan will also lower the player's temperature, but only while the player is running.
* Eating one of the following food items will temporarily cool the player down by 1°C per second for various amounts of time. Eating even stale or spoiled food can also cool the player down.

| Food Item         | Cool Down Time |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Watermelon        | 5 seconds     |
| Fruit Medley      | 5 seconds     |
| Ice               | 7.5 seconds   |
| Melonsicle        | 10 seconds    |
| Ice Cream         | 15 seconds    |
| Ceviche           | 10 seconds    |
| Banana Pop        | 10 seconds    |
| Jelly-O Pop       | 10 seconds    |
| Neon Quattro      | 10 seconds    |
| Tropical Bouillabaisse | 10 seconds |
| Iced Tea         | 10 seconds    |
| Asparagazpacho   | 40 degrees lower than environment for 5 minutes. |

* Wetness will decrease gained temperature up to 30°C at the cost of Sanity and negative effects on items.
* The player can sleep during the day in a Siesta Lean-to to cool down and skip to dusk, thus preventing further overheating.
* A Thermal Stone can be brought near an Endothermic Fire or Endothermic Fire Pit to cool it or placed in a stationary Ice Box or a mobile Snow Chester to freeze it. It will cool the player down as long as it's in stage 1 or stage 2.
* The cheapest way to cool down is to run around a Tree holding a Whirly Fan.

### Delaying Overheating

There are several ways to delay overheating:

* Retreating to the Caves will slow down the rate at which heat is gained (240 Insulation).
* Dusk and Night will slow down the rate at which heat is gained (60/

# Bird Trap

## Overview
- **Item Type**: Survival Item
- **Purpose**: Capture winged beasts
- **Ingredients**: 
  - Twigs (3x)
  - Silk (4x)
- **Unlocked at**: Science Machine
- **Durability**: 8 uses
- **Perk**: Captures Birds. Can be baited.

## Description
The Bird Trap is a Survival Item used to catch Birds. It can be crafted using 3 Twigs and 4 Silk, and requires a Science Machine to prototype. Bird Traps can be baited with Seeds to significantly increase the chance of catching a Bird, though it is not a requirement. Using a Feather Hat will increase the number of birds landing to speed up the process.

## Trivia
- Following the "Naughty and Nice" update, Feathers and Morsels can no longer be acquired directly using the Trap. Instead, murdering the Bird while it's in the Inventory is now necessary.
- In the old science system, the Bird Trap used to cost 30 Research Points to craft.

## Bugs
- Sometimes Birds will glitch out of Traps after being caught.
- If the Bird Trap is picked up right as it catches a Bird, the Bird may disappear.
- Sometimes the Trap will turn invisible, but will still be shown on the map. The player can press space when near it to get it back.
- In the "Shipwrecked" DLC, putting a Seed retrieved from the Ocean inside the Bird Trap may make it look like it's still in the Ocean. Picking up the Bird Trap may cause the Seed to disappear.

# Cartography Filter

[[File:Cartography Filter.png|thumb|96px|Filter Icon]]

{{Exclusivity|Don't Starve Together}}
{{Quote|Now I can show everyone what I found!|Wilson}}
The **Cartography Filter** is a **Filter** in the crafting menu of **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It allows the players to craft items using the **Cartographer's Desk**. Similar to the **Ancient Pseudoscience Filter** and the **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**, items under this Filter cannot be prototyped and then made on the go in the future; in order to craft an item under this Filter, the player must always be near a Cartographer's Desk, no matter how many times the item has been crafted.

## Craftable Items
- **Map Scroll** | [Map Scroll](link=Map Scroll)

## Trivia
* The original Cartography Tab was introduced in the **A Little Fixer Upper** update. With the introduction of **Crafting Filters** in the **March 2022 QoL update**, it was replaced by the Cartography Filter.
* Before the introduction of crafting filters, players were not able to access the Cartography Tab while **Creative Mode** was turned on because the Cartography Tab shared the same space with the **Ancient Tab**.
* **Cartography** is the science and practice of making maps.

- Choose: Winona

The Sea Weed is a plant-like mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together introduced in Return of Them. They appear in groups of 8 to 15 in the Rough Ocean. There are 3 species of Sea Weed: Pink, Yellow, and White.

Every 2.5 to 3.5 minutes (1 to 2 minutes for Pink Sea Weeds), they release a pollen cloud. The cloud attracts nearby Ocean Fishes similarly to Fish Food. If no other fishes are present, one Spittlefish appears. When killed or caught, the Spittlefish regenerates in 4 minutes (2 minutes for White Sea Weeds).

The base of a Sea Weed grows up to 3 Barnacles. They can be harvested directly or by using a Razor. The Barnacles regrow in 2.5 to 4 days each. Upon harvesting, the Sea Weed and all nearby Sea Weeds wake up and attack the player, unless the player is Wormwood or they used Razor when the Sea Weed is sleeping (like during the night).

Sea Weeds attack by launching projectiles in the air. They do 68 damage to the player. If these projectiles miss, they will instead make a leak in the boat. All nearby Sea Weeds will wake up and attack the player if one is attacked or if a Boat is rammed into them too fast. Sea Weeds will not wake up at night, so it is safe to attack one without the others waking.

Upon death, they drop 2 or 3 Seedshells (3 plus two times a 50% chance for Yellow Sea Weed), unharvested Barnacles, one Sea Sprout Starter and a Sea Stack which can be mined for 2 Rocks.

## Mob Infobox: Sea Sprout

Quotes:
- Wilson: This one's just a sprout.
- Willow: It's small now, but it'll get bigger.
- Wolfgang: Ha! So small and weak!
- Wendy: I could cut it down now, before it grows...
- WX-78: LET'S KILL IT NOW

The **Razor** is a craftable **Tool** **Item** found in the **Tools** Tab. It requires 2 **Twigs** and 2 **Flint**s to craft, and a **Science Machine** to prototype. Unlike other Tools, on pc it cannot be equipped, and to be used it has to be lifted and used on a target instead. Players using a **wikipedia:controller** have to simply be near an entity that can be shaved for the "Shave" prompt to appear. Since it has no **durability**, the Razor has infinite uses.

The Razor can be used to shave **Wilson**'s Beard, which provides leftover **Beard Hair**. To shave the Beard, simply right-click the Razor while it's in the inventory, or hover over the target. The amount of Beard Hair received depends on the beard's length. The Razor can also be used to shave **Beefalo**s while they are sleeping (whether at night or when put to sleep using **Sleep Dart**s, a **Life Giving Amulet**, or a **Pan Flute**), resulting in 3 **Beefalo Wool**. This requires taking it out of the inventory and hovering over the beefalo. The Beefalo will not wake up after being shaved, but Beefalo in **Beefalo#Mating Season|heat** will sometimes wake up and attack. In **Don't Starve Together|Dont starve together**, you can use a razor to shave **Sea Weed|sea weeds** for up to 3 **barnacles**. This depends on how many barnacles the sea weed has, and will aggravate any nearby sea weeds.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, **Webber** can also use the Razor to shave his Beard. The amount of **Silk** received depends on the Beard's length.

At this point, in the **Shipwrecked** DLC, the Razor cannot be used to shave **Water Beefalo**.

In the **Hamlet** DLC, Razors can be used to shave **Hedge**s for 1 **Clippings** each.

## Tips

* Using the Razor to acquire Beefalo Wool is more efficient than killing Beefalo outright since the Wool will eventually regrow allowing players to shave the same Beefalo again for more Wool.
** If players need to kill a Beefalo anyway, it is advised to shave them first for some Wool, since even when shaved, Beefalo will still drop Beefalo Wool on death.
* Wearing a **

A **Sinkhole** is the entrance to a [[Cave]] and can be found randomly in the world. Each Sinkhole leads to a new Cave or Ruin. The cave-side of a sinkhole is a staircase or cave-exit.

When first discovered, the Sinkhole will be a Plugged Sinkhole and is covered with a jagged rubble mound; Player can usually tell they are close to a Plugged Sinkhole on the surface when they find Rocks lying about in the Biomes for no reason. Mining the Plug reveals the hole with a rope going down into its depths while providing [[Flint]] and [[Rock]]s on the surface and [[Thulecite]], as well as [[Thulecite Fragments]] underground. It takes six hits from a [[Pickaxe]] to unplug it. Once unplugged, up to 6 [[Batilisk]]s will spawn quickly from the Sinkhole at dusk and return underground in the morning. If Batilisks are killed, they will respawn at a rate of 1 per minute until the maximum of 6 has been reached.

There are only three Sinkholes in a surface world and one for each Cave. Plugged and open Sinkholes are marked on a [[map]] by a gray mound and a hole with a red arrow pointing downwards, respectively.

On default settings, the three surface Sinkholes are guaranteed to spawn in the following locations:
* A [[Mosaic]] biome.
* A [[Pig Village]] (generally, this village also has a [[Pig King]]).
* The [[Forest]] biome found in the center of the world's [[Marsh]].
The number of sinkholes in the [[Sandbox Mode|world settings]] can only be "Default" and "None".

Thulecite Sinkholes are usually found on [[Stalagmite Terrain]].
__NOTOC__

## Downloadable Content
In the [[Hamlet]] DLC, Sinkhole can be found in [[Pinacle]] [[Biome]], which can only be accessible via [[BFB]]. Sinkhole

## Quote
"Mind says no. Muscles say yes!" - Wolfgang

### Origin
Wolfgang is the second playable [[character|Character]] in ''[[Don't Starve]]'' that can be unlocked via [[Experience]], with 320 XP, and one of the playable Characters in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' ({{Pic24|Don't Starve Together icon}}). He is a simple-minded [[wikipedia:Strongman_(strength_athlete)|Strongman]] who is very boastful about his might.

### Trivia
- In-Game
  - Wolfgang was added on [[Don't Starve/Version_History#October 2, 2012 - Update|October 2nd, 2012]] when the game was still in Beta.
  - Wolfgang's previous perk, before the ''[[Don't Starve/Version_History#July 2nd, 2013 - Strange New Powers|Strange New Powers]]'' update, was 75 more Health and Hunger (maximum of 225 each), and a 1.5× damage multiplier, similar to his current Mighty Form.
  - Wolfgang's voice is played by a tuba, which changes in pitch depending on his current form.
- Lore
  - Wolfgang was a strongman working in a circus.
  - It is implied that Wolfgang was also in a military.

### Cultural References
- Wolfgang's rather unusual [[Wolfgang quotes|quotes]] may be a reference to the phrase "brains over brawn," in that he has only the latter.
- Wolfgang's eating mechanics may be a reference to strongman training diets which entail eating 10,000 calories a day.

# Floats

Floats are **Items** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. Their sole purpose is to be combined with a **Sea Fishing Rod** to improve the casting range and accuracy of the landing. Most of them can be crafted in the **Fishing Filter**, requiring a **Tackle Receptacle** to prototype, while some of them can also be acquired by trading with the **Crabby Hermit** in the **Bottle Exchange Filter**.

The **Hardened Rubber Bung** Trinket can also be used as a Float, however, it cannot be crafted.

Below is a table of the performance statistics for all Floats.

| Float | Max Range | Range deviation from casting point | Angle deviation from casting point |
|-------|----------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| None  | 5        | 30%                             | 40°                               |
| Twigs | 7        | 20%                             | 30°                               |
| Wooden Ball Bobber | 9 | 20%                             | 20°                               |
| Hardened Slip Bobber | 11 | 20%                             | 20°                               |
| Hardened Rubber Bung | 13 | 20%                             | 30°                               |
| Jet Quill Float, Crimson Quill Float, Azure Quill Float, Saffron Quill Float | 9 | 15%                             | 15°                               |
| Down Quill Float, Malbatross Quill Float | 13 | 5%                             | 5°                               |

## Description
Birchnuts are [[Food]] [[item]]s dropped from [[Birchnut Tree]]s or [[Birchnutter]]s in the ''[[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]]'' DLC. Like [[Pine Cone]]s, Birchnuts can be planted to create a new Birchnut Tree. It takes from 2.5 to 5 minutes for them to grow from saplings into small trees. Birchnuts can alternatively be used as a [[food]] [[:Category:Items|item]] by being [[Cooking|cooked]] on a [[campfire]] and turned into a roasted Birchnut.

Birchnuts can't be planted on [[Checkerboard Flooring]]s, [[Wooden Flooring]]s, [[Cobblestone]]s, [[Carpeted Flooring]]s, [[Rocky Turf]]s, [[Sandy Turf]]s, and [[Cave Rock Turf]]s, unless it has been planted before these [[Turfs]] were placed.

Chopping down anything but a Large Birchnut Tree
