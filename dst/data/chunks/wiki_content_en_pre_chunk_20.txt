# Coaching Whistle

The Coaching Whistle is a Character-specific craftable Item exclusive to Wolfgang in *Don't Starve Together*. It can be crafted once Wolfgang has unlocked the Coach Wolfgang Skill in his Skill Tree, requiring 1 Flint and 1 Rope.

## Description
- **Durability:** Infinite
- **Description:** Let out your inner coach!
- **Image:** Coaching Whistle Dropped.png
- **Icon:** Coaching Whistle.png
- **Ingredients:**
  - Flint: 1
  - Rope: 1 (only for Wolfgang)
- **Skill:** Coach Wolfgang
- **Skill Owner:** Wolfgang
- **Spawn Code:** "wolfgang_whistle"
- **Perk:** Gives sanity to nearby players and doubles the damage of nearby followers.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It gives me terrible flashbacks to the gym classes of my youth..."
- Willow: "I can't NOT listen to him when he's holding a shiny whistle!"
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang is good teacher!"
- ... (and more)

## Effects
- Wolfgang will continue coaching even after dropping the whistle; however, reverting to Wimpy or Mighty form will cancel the coaching.
- Followers' double damage buff will be active only roughly one third of the time, due to the average time it takes for Wolfgang to trigger his motivation while coaching.

## Creatures Affected by the Whistle
(Here would be the gallery of affected creatures, but since I can't display images, I'm listing them textually below):
- Tamed Pig
- Tamed Merms
- Tamed Rock Lobster
- Tamed Spider
- Tamed Spider Warrior
- Tamed Dangling Depth Dweller
- Tamed Cave Spider
- Tamed Spitter
- Tamed Nurse Spider
- Tamed Sea Strider
- Tamed Shattered Spider
- Abigail
- Shadow Duelist
- Grumble Bee spawned by Apicultural Notes

## Prototype Tips
- If Wolfgang stops coaching a few seconds after the motivation triggers and immediately starts coaching again, he will only have a 7 second cooldown to motivate again. Effectively, Wolfgang's coaching can have close to 100% uptime if managed correctly.

## Trivia
- The Coaching Whistle was introduced in the *Skill Spotlight: Wormwood, Wolfgang, Woodie* update.

# Saddle

## Description
The **Saddle** is a **Tool** item that must be used to mount a **Beefalo** for riding. It is crafted at the **Alchemy Engine** with 4 **Pig Skin**s, 4 **Gold Nugget**s and 4 **Beefalo Wool**.

## Crafting Recipe
- Ingredient 1: Beefalo Wool (Multiplier: 4)
- Ingredient 2: Pig Skin (Multiplier: 4)
- Ingredient 3: Gold Nugget (Multiplier: 4)

## Usage
Before saddling a Beefalo, players must feed it **Vegetable**s or **Fruit** (typically **Light Bulb**s, **Cut Grass**, or **Twigs**) to raise its obedience to the desired level (10% per item, max 100%). In **DST**, it's a good idea to also bond with the beefalo using a **Beefalo Bell** before saddling. If the Beefalo's obedience is below 10%, it will reject any attempt to saddle it and attack the player. Below 40% obedience, it will quickly shake the saddle off. Obedience must be at least 50% to allow riding.

## Durability
Saddles only lose durability when a Beefalo's obedience drops below 40% and it shakes the saddle off. A **Saddlehorn** is the only way to manually remove a saddle and it does so without losing saddle durability.

## War Saddle
The **War Saddle** is a variant of the normal Saddle that can be shaken off by a disobedient beefalo 8 times instead of 5. It has a 25% speed increase instead of 40%, and adds 16 bonus damage to melee attacks made while riding the Beefalo. It requires 4 live **Rabbit**s, 10 **Log**s, and 4 **Steel Wool** to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

## Glossamer Saddle
The **Glossamer Saddle** is a variant of the normal Saddle that can be crafted using 2 **Living Logs**, 4 **Silk**, and 68 **Butterfly Wings**. It requires an Alchemy Engine to prototype. This saddle allows a 55% riding speed above the base speed of the Beefalo (vs. 40% for a regular Saddle).

## Tips
- A War Saddle brings Ornery Beefalo attack damage to a whopping 66 points, almost equaling the 68 damage of the **Dark Sword** without having to worry about sanity drain or durability. However, a Glossamer Saddle offsets the slowness, making it easier to kite with.
- The 25 damage delivered by a Rider or 20 by a Pudgy Beefalo may not be enough to kill the **Ewecus** to obtain steel wool to make a War Saddle. Plan accordingly.
- Obtaining the Butterfly Wings for a Glossamer Saddle can be a lengthy process complicated by spoilage.

## Trivia
- Saddles were first introduced to **Don't Starve Together**. They were later added to **Don't Starve** in the **Quality of Life** update.
- Saddles are considered to be part of **A New Reign**, even though they were introduced before the official start of the beta branch.
- The Glossamer Saddle is the first item in the game that requires Butterfly Wings as a crafting ingredient.

![Filter Icon](Sculptures Filter.png)
**May the muses guide our hands!** - Wigfrid

The **Sculptures Filter** is a **Filter** in the crafting menu of *Don't Starve Together*, introduced in *A New Reign*. It allows the players to craft objects using the **Potter's Wheel**. Similar to the **Ancient Pseudoscience Filter** and the **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**, items under this Filter cannot be prototyped and then made on the go in the future; in order to craft an item under this Filter, the player must always be near a Potter's Wheel, no matter how many times the item has been crafted.

## Craftable Items and Structures

# Carcasses

Carcasses are the dead bodies of creatures. Besides the Koalefant Carcass, all of them appear after killing a certain mob under certain conditions. They can be burned to avoid their respective spawn.

## Hound Carcass

![Hound](Hound.png) in [Lunar Island].

**Dropped By:** Hound  
**Can Be Burned:** Yes  
**Image:** ![Hound Corpse](Hound_Corps.png)  
**Name:** Hound

**Hound Carcasses** have a 50% chance of staying after any Hound was killed on Lunar Island, during a Moonstorm or if it was spawned by a Possessed Varg. After a couple of seconds of being on the ground, a single Horror Hound will jump out of the Carcass.

---

## Koalefant Carcass

**Can Be Burned:** Yes  
**Image:**  
![Koalefant's Carcass Stage 1](Koalefant's_Carcass.png)  
![Koalefant's Carcass Stage 2](Koalefant's_Carcass_2.png)  
![Koalefant's Carcass Stage 3](Koalefant's_Carcass_3.png)  
![Koalefant's Carcass Stage 4](Koalefant's_Carcass_4.png)  
**Name:** Koalefant

Tracking a [Suspicious Dirt Pile] with a [Hound's Tooth] on it will eventually lead to a **Koalefant Carcass** surrounded by a Varg and some Hounds which will progressively eat from the Carcass. The Carcass will disappear once the Varg and Hounds have been defeated or after the Varg bites its bones once it's done eating.

The Koalefant Carcass will have 2 [Meat] and 1 [Koalefant Trunk] dropped around it. The Varg and its Hounds will not eat them as long as the Carcass still has meat on it.

The Koalefant Carcass has four stages as it is being eaten: it is fully intact in the first stage; in its second and third stage, its top half will disappear, revealing the Koalefant's spine and ribcage, and in the fourth stage all meat will be gone from it, leaving only some bones behind.

---

## Boss Carcasses

**Can Be Burned:** Yes  
**Dropped By:** [Deerclops]/[Bearger]/[Varg]  
**Image:**  
![Deerclops Carcass](Deerclops_Carcass.png)  
![Bearger Carcass](Bearger_Carcass.png)  
![Varg Carcass](Varg_Carcass.png)

**Rift Content | Lunar Rift** When a Lunar Rift is active in the world, killing Deerclops, Bearger or Varg will leave their respective **Boss Carcass** on the ground. After some time, a Brightshade Gestalt will appear and float to the Carcass. Afterwards, it enters the Carcass and reanimates the fallen Mob. The Deerclops, Bearger and Varg Carcasses will turn into Crystal Deerclops, Armored Bearger and, Possessed Varg, respectively.

---

### Tips

* Be quick about Hound Carcasses, as setting on fire while its emerging animation is already playing will still spawn a Horror Hound after attempting to burn it.

---

### Trivia

* The Hound Carcass was added in **Return of Them**.
* The Koalefant and Boss Carcasses were added in **From Beyond**.

# Rose-Colored Glasses

The **Rose-Colored Glasses** is a head-slot gear item that can only be crafted and used by a [Winona](Don't Starve Together) with the [Shadow Seeker I] skill. Winona can equip the Rose-Colored Glasses and interact with various objects and places for different effects. This interaction is called "Closely Examine".

## Usage

Interacting with valid objects or places while wearing the Rose-Colored Glasses will spawn a Dark Vestige, which can be activated to trigger the corresponding effect. Some objects, like [Flowers], cannot be examined directly. With the default settings, the player can use Alt + Left Click to examine.

The player can closely examine the Dark Vestige to deactivate it.

### Vine Bridge

Winona can interact with the edge of the land if there is an edge on the opposite side at most 3 tiles away. This generally works anywhere, e.g. at Ocean coasts, at "lakes" in the Mosaic biome and also on the Lunar Island. This examination will spawn a Dark Vestige, which in turn will spawn a temporary Vine Bridge when activated. The bridge lasts 18 seconds and will start to shake a few seconds before it disappears, which the character will also mention. If there is a Dock on either side of the land, this skill cannot be used. This ability has no cooldown.

### Nightmare Fuel and Pure Horror

Winona with the Rose-Colored Glasses can also closely examine Charlie-related or shadow-related structures and spawn a Dark Vestige. On activating that Dark Vestige, it will drop one Nightmare Fuel. This ability has a half-day cooldown.

With the [Shadow Seeker II] skill, some objects will have a 5% chance to drop one Pure Horror instead. Some other objects have a 25% chance to drop one Pure Horror instead.

| Object | Name | Chance to get Pure Horror with Shadow Seeker II |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Florid Postern] | Florid Postern (Not Celestial Portal) | 5% |
| ![Touch Stone] | Touch Stone | 5% |
| ![Playbill] | Playbill | 5% |
| ![Stage] | Stage | 5% |
| ![Maxwell Statue] | Maxwell Statue | 5% |
| ![Harp Statue] | Harp Statue | 5% |
| ![Ancient Statue] | Ancient Statue | 25% |
| ![Atrium Statue] | Atrium Statue | 25% |
| ![Ancient Gateway] | Ancient Gateway | 25% |
| ![Ancient Beacon] | Ancient Beacon | 25% |
| ![Ancient Pseudoscience Station] | Ancient Pseudoscience Station | 25% |
| ![Broken Pseudoscience Station] | Broken Pseudoscience Station | 25% |
| ![Ancient Mural] | Ancient Mural | 25% |
| ![Ornate Chest] | Ornate Chest | 25% |
| ![Cracked Pillar] | Cracked Pillar | 25% |
| ![Ancient Obelisk] | Ancient Obelisk | 25% |
| ![Nightmare Light] | Nightmare Light | 25% |
| ![Relic] | Relic (Not a replica) | 25% |

### Wormhole and Big Slimy Pit

Winona with the [Shadow Seeker II] skill can closely examine a Worm Hole or Big Slimy Pit to spawn a Dark Vestige. Upon activation of it, she then can select to which other Worm Hole or Big Slimy Pit she wants to travel. This ability does not have any cooldown. Winona can pick any Worm Hole or Big Slimy Pit that she has discovered on the map. The Big Slimy Pit's Big Tentacle has to be killed before examining, and after going through it, the Big Slimy Pit's Big Tentacle at the destination will grow back.

### Fragile Rose

Winona with the [Shadow Seeker II] skill can closely examine any flower. The Flower will turn into a Rose and a Dark Vestige will spawn. When Winona activates the Dark Vestige, she will pick up a Fragile Rose. If Winona dies with a Fragile Rose in her inventory, she will be revived immediately. The player can closely examine the Dark Vestige to deactivate it, but the Flower will remain a Rose. This ability has a half-day cooldown.

# Beefalo Bell

The **Beefalo Bell** is a unique item in **Don't Starve Together** that allows players to bond with a single **Beefalo** at a time. Once bonded, the Beefalo will follow the player, even into caves and while the player is offline.

## Description
The Beefalo Bell is crafted using three **Gold Nuggets** and one **Flint**, and requires the **Science Machine** to prototype. It enables the player to befriend a Beefalo by hovering the bell over it and clicking the left mouse button. Players can name their Beefalo by typing it in or by choosing from a list of names generated by clicking the Random button. The default name given is "Player's Beefalo". A player may only be bonded with one Beefalo at a time.

## Usage
- Bonded Beefalo will follow the player unless the player aggravates them or nearby Beefalo, even when untamed.
- The player can break the bond by right-clicking the bell.
- When a player goes offline with a Beefalo Bell, the Bonded Beefalo disappears with the player.
- The bell allows players to take Beefalo into the **Cave** and through **Worm Holes**.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It makes beefalo friendly. I'm sure there's a very scientific explanation."
- Willow: "Wow, making friends is easy!"
- Wolfgang: "Ringy ding!"
- Wendy: "Alas, not a death knell."
- WX-78: "AN EFFICIENT TOOL FOR GAINING LOYALTY"
- Wickerbottom: "Something about its tone triggers an affectionate response in beefalo."
- Woodie: "Beefalo sure seem to like the sound it makes."
- Maxwell: "It appears to have some kind of hypnotic effect on beefalo."
- Wigfrid: "This bell commands loyalty from the woolen beasts."
- Webber: "The beefalo really like this bell, and whoever rings it!"
- Winona: "The beefalo sure do like that bell!"
- Warly: "It is not a dinner bell?"
- Wortox: "What a strange enchantment!"
- Wormwood: "Ding dong"
- Wurt: "Big fuzzies really like bell."
- Walter: "The beefalo seem to really like the sound it makes!"

## Possible Generated Beefalo Names
- Annabeef
- Beefy
- Beefssie
- Betsbeef
- Beefa
- Daisbeef
- Dixbeef
- Gertbeef
- Beefgus
- Beefinand
- Wellington
- Bradbeef
- Beefany
- Harry
- Hoofrey
- Beeftholomew
- Guineveal
- Patty O'Beef
- Beeferella

## Tips
- The bell is a handy tool to have around when taming a Beefalo, as feeding it to make it a follower can be expensive.
- The bell can be used to hunt individual Beefalo by leading it away from its herd.
- If the bell is dropped on the floor, the bonded Beefalo will wander around the general area of the bell, running back towards it if it strays too far.
- The bonded Beefalo will go in heat as usual, which will eventually create a small herd from a single Beefalo.
  - So long as the Beefalo Bell is held by the player, the bonded Beefalo will not attack them if they are in heat, although their offspring will.
  - If the bonded Beefalo is in heat and the bell is placed on the floor, it will be aggressive to its owner.
- The bonded Beefalo will continue dropping **Manure** and can be shaven with a **Razor**, giving an easy source of both.
- The Beefalo Bell can be kept at home base, which allows Domesticated Beefalo to go home by themselves if the player is too far from base.

## Trivia
- The Beefalo Bell was introduced in the **Year of the Beefalo**, as part of the event.
  - Crafting Beefalo Bell using Beefalo Shrine is no longer available when the **Year of the Beefalo** event is enabled.
- The Beefalo Bell resembles a real-life instrument called a Cowbell.
- The name "Wellington" is likely a play on words of the dish, [Beef Wellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_Wellington).

# Seasons

Seasons are different times of the **Don't Starve** year in which the environment changes, changing the gameplay. Note that while seasons have specific lengths specified in the code, there appears to be relatively common rounding errors that result in one extra day being in a season; this tends to add 1-2 days per year. In Don't Starve Together, these extra days are much less common.

## Sandbox Mode

In **Sandbox Mode**, if you don't customize your world, the first **Winter** will begin on day 21 and end on day 35 (15 days total). The seasons should then keep alternating between 20 day Summers and 15 day Winters (next winter on day 56, etc.).

## Customization

- A long season lasts around 50 days
- A short season lasts around 10 days

## Seasonal Effects

- **Summer**: Days are longer, crops grow, and Food is easier to find.
- **Winter**: Nights are longer, and the player must stay warm to avoid Freezing to death. Plants stop growing and many creatures stop being active, while other creatures can only be encountered during Winter.

## Preparing for Winter

Winter can be a challenge and should not be taken lightly. Players should prepare for Winter during the Summer by stocking up on resources and making sure they will have sources of heat, Food, and Health, as well as the means to defend themselves from Monsters.

## Reign of Giants

In the **Reign of Giants** DLC as well as **Don't Starve Together**, there are four seasons; Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Winter is largely the same, albeit with changes to Deerclops that make survival more difficult. Autumn, for the most part, is the old Summer, making it the safest season of the year. A new Summer has been added, in which the player is susceptible to Overheating (the opposite of "Freezing" in the Winter). During Spring, there is no Freezing or Overheating, but rainfall is excessive and can cause Wetness, which causes rapid Sanity loss, and can lead to Freezing after prolonged exposure. Rabbit holes will close, forcing the player to switch food sources in the Spring, Bees will turn red (hostile) and Beefalos will be in heat, making them hostile to everything.

| Season | Very Short (Days) | Short (Days) | Default (Days) | Long (Days) | Very Long (Days) |
|--------|------------------|-------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| Spring | 5                | 12          | 20            | 31         | 50              |
| Summer | 5                | 10          | 15            | 22         | 40              |
| Autumn | 5                | 12          | 20            | 30         | 50              |
| Winter | 5                | 10          | 15            | 22         | 40              |

Each season now has its own "Giant", or boss mob, that spawns sometime during the respective season. Winter retains the Deerclops, but now there is the Bearger in Autumn, the Antlion(DST)/Dragonfly(RoG) in Summer, and the Moose/Goose in Spring. Each giant will drop a material needed to craft an item that can be used to better survive the hazards of the following season, with the exception of the Dragonfly, as being before Autumn (the season with no special hazard), will instead drop a material to craft an item used for combat or a special container.

## Shipwrecked

In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, there are four seasons; Mild Season (20 days), Hurricane Season (16 days), Monsoon Season (20 days), and Dry Season (16 days). Compared to Reign of Giants, the year is slightly longer, at 72 days, as half the seasons have an extra day.

- Mild Season is equivalent to autumn without hazards apart from occasional strong winds and mild rain.
- Hurricane Season differs the most from seasons in Reign of Giants where instead of having to deal with cold, the hazards are frequent strong winds, downpour, lightning, and large waves.
- Monsoon Season is similar to spring with frequent rains but with additional hazard of areas getting flooded.
- Dry season is equivalent to Reign of Giants' summer with overheating but with the added danger of volcanoes erupting.

## Hamlet

In the **Hamlet** DLC, there are three seasons; Temperate Season, Humid Season, and Lush Season. Each season lasts for 11 days, making Hamlet's year the shortest at 33 days. The Temperate Season is the equivalent of Autumn, with no special hazards, other than short rain showers and thunderstorms

It is placed at a set location and can be teleported to as long as the player is within a certain range, indicated by the blinking light on top of the Telebrella. The Telipad you teleport is the closest one that you don't stand on, that means you could have a network of Telipads to get to places very fast and cheap.

### Description
Wildbore Houses replace [Pig Houses] in the [Don't Starve: Shipwrecked] DLC. They are occasionally encountered in the [Beach] biome. Each house contains a single [Wildbore], which will roam around the house during day time. A new Wildbore will spawn from the house in 4 days, if the previous occupant is killed. Similar to Pig Houses, Wildbore Houses emit light at night if they are occupied, but it will go out if the player gets too close to the house. The houses can be crafted using 8 [Bamboo]s, 5 [Palm Leaves], and 4 [Pig Skin]s, and requires the [Alchemy Engine] to prototype.

Similar to [Pigs], Wildbores will always head to their houses at dusk, unless they are in combat when the day changes to dusk. Unlike Pigs, Wildbores will attempt to protect their houses if they see the player destroying it with a [Hammer].

If a Shipwrecked-compatible world is created, there is a small chance of having several Wildbore Houses spawn within a [Pig Village], making them accessible in worlds that have not been connected to a Shipwrecked world.

### Trivia
- In the pre-release version of Shipwrecked, [Strong Winds] could destroy Wildbore Houses. This behavior has been removed from the game in the [Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#Version History|Seas the Day] update.

## Nautopilot
- It is used to place a **Nautopilot** on a **Boat**. An activated Nautopilot finds an activated Nautopilot Beacon within six squares of turf and pulls the Boat towards it with a force of ×0.6. This mechanic allows you to carefully park the Boat to a coast without causing damage to it. It can also be used to control multiple chained boats. To activate the Nautopilot, you need to click on it with the left mouse button, after which it will search for an unpaired Nautopilot Beacon and pair with it. If no Nautopilot Beacon was found, the Nautopilot will turn inactive.

# Wobster Dens

## Exclusivity: Shipwrecked
_Wobster Dens_ are a naturally occurring **structure** from the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They are the home and spawning place for **Wobster**s, found only in the **Shallow Ocean**. Wobsters will come out of their holes at **Dusk**, staying into the night until dawn. They will retreat back if frightened. When a Wobster is captured or killed, another will respawn from the hole in a half to one and a half days.

## Description

## Scrapbook Info: Mutates some creatures and plants into their lunar mutated form.

The **Lunar Experiment** is a feature exclusive to the **Hallowed Nights** event in **Don't Starve Together**. It can be conducted at the **Mad Scientist Lab**, using a **Moon Moth Wing** and a **Lune Tree Blossom**, and depleting 10 **Sanity** for the player. The experiment has a 50% chance to result in only one potion, a 30% to result in two potions, and a 20% to result in three potions.

The experiment will result in a **Steeped Lunar Essence** that can be used to change items and mobs into their Lunar counterparts, e.g., **Butterfly** into **Moon Moth**.

## Transformations

- Butterfly → Moon Moth
- Light Bulb → Bulbous Lightbug
- Light Flower → Light Flower (note: this changes Light Flower that gives Light Bulb upon harvesting into the Light Flower that spawns Bulbous Light Bug)
- Sapling Item → Sapling (Moon)
- Flower → Lune Tree Sapling
- Carrot → Carrat
- Dragon Fruit → Saladmander Ripe
- Spider/Spider Warrior/Cave Spider/Spitter/Dangling Depth Dweller/Nurse Spider → Shattered Spider
- Hound → Horror Hound
- Pengull → Moonrock Pengull
- Crow/Snowbird/Canary → Moonblind Crow
- Redbird/Puffin → Misshapen Bird

## Tips
- Because it has a chance to give multiple potions, it can be used to multiply Lune Trees by planting 6 flowers, releasing a bee to propagate those flowers, turning the flowers into Lune Trees, chopping those trees for blossoms, and killing the spawned moths for wings.
- Note also that flowers spawn butterflies, which can be turned into moths, which can be captured and planted as lune trees.
- It can be used on a flying bird to stun it, making it fall to the ground where it can be picked up.

## Trivia
- The Lunar Experiment was introduced to the Hallowed Nights event in 2019.

## Description
Dragoon Dens are naturally spawning Structures introduced in the Shipwrecked DLC. They are found inside the Volcano and spawn Dragoons. They can also be crafted, requiring 1 Dragoon Heart, 5 Rocks and 4 Obsidian to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Dragoon Dens cannot be Hammered, but they can be deconstructed using explosives, such as Gunpowder, Coconade or Slurtle Slime. It takes 2, 1, and 14 of each, respectively, to deconstruct a Den. Note that if using Slurtle Slime, it must be placed around the Den in 14 separate stacks.

They can house 3 to 4 Dragoons at a time. During the Day, one will leave the Den every 30 seconds, returning at Dusk. If a Dragoon dies, it takes 2 minutes for the Den to regenerate it.

# Pretty Parasol

The **Pretty Parasol** is a **Survival** item. Like an **Umbrella**, it negates **Sanity** loss caused by **Rain** when equipped. If playing as **WX-78**, the Pretty Parasol will prevent damage caused by **Rain** and prevent being struck by **Lightning**.

## crafting requirements
- **Twigs**: 4
- **Cut Grass**: 3
- **Petals**: 6

It can also be used as a **Fuel**, providing the same burn time as a **Log**.

## properties
- **Water Resistance**: 50% resistance
- **Overheating Resistance**: 120
- **Sanity Drain**: +2.00/min
- **Burn Time**: 3 min
- **Spawn Code**: "grass_umbrella"
- **Spoil**: 2 days

## skin

In **Don't Starve Together**, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the **Belongings** page.

### Rosy Posy Parasol
- **Description**: "April showers bring May flowers."
- **Ingame**: [[File:Rosy Posy Parasol Wilson.png|See ingame]]

## tips
- One of **Crabby Hermit|Pearl**'s quests requires the player to give her a rain insulation item while it's raining. Since another one of her quests requires you to plant ten **Flower|Flowers** on her island, the player can then pick these Flowers to craft a Pretty Parasol as soon as it starts to rain. This way the player doesn't need to give her the more expensive **Umbrella**.
- Due to its cheap cost, as a temporary measure, it can be an effective alternative to the Umbrella in **Spring**.

## trivia
- The Pretty Parasol was first introduced in the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC and was also present in the **Hamlet** DLC. It was then added to the base game in the **Hamlet** Early Access beta branch on April 18, 2019.
- The Pretty Parasol is unavailable for crafting in the **Shipwrecked** DLC unless playing as Wagstaff, which instead has the **Tropical Parasol**.

# Deerclops

**Deerclops** is a boss monster that is only active during Winter, unless edited in World Customization. It has big health and does big damage and can destroy structures and trees, making it very dangerous if it enters the player's camp. The Deerclops is aggressive towards anything it encounters and can kill most creatures easily. Its monstrous appearance drains Sanity quickly when the character gets too close.

## Structure Infobox

- **Image**: ![Deerclops](Deerclops.png)
- **Image Width**: 200
- **Health**: 2000
- **Damage**: 75 to player, 150 to mobs
- **Attack Period**: 3
- **Attack Range**: 6
- **Walk Speed**: 3
- **Sanity Aura**: -400 (in combat), -100 (outside of combat)
- **Spawn Code**: "deerclops"
- **Special Ability**: AoE attack. Destroys structures and trees. Freezes enemies in Reign of Giants.
- **Drops**: 8 pieces of Meat, Deerclops Eyeball

## Quotes

- Wilson: It's enormous!!
- Willow: Holy crap!
- Wolfgang: He looks mightier than me.
- Wendy: Death incarnate!
- WX-78: DANGER! THREAT INCOMING!
- Wickerbottom: Laurasiatheria!
- Woodie: That's a big moose!
- Maxwell: Even I'm afraid of that guy.
- Wagstaff: Displays an intriguing amount of hostility toward architecture.
- Wigfrid: Rays will shine through my spear and poke out your eyeball!
- Webber: He might be able to digest me!
- Walani: Yikes! We're in the impact zone now!
- Warly: I once had a saucier who looked like that.
- Woodlegs: Arrrr ye serious?
- Wilba: 'TIS EVIL-EYED BEASTIE
- Wormwood: Branch Head branches
- Wheeler: Mind holding my stuff while I run away in terror?
- Winona: Don't even think about it, you dumb lug!
- Wortox: So large, so rude, so full of 'tude!
- Wurt: She not look happy, florp.
- Walter: Woah! It's you!
- Wanda: Do we really have to do this again?

## Behavior

The Deerclops spawns during Winter near the player. Its approach is signaled by a deep moaning sound, which the character will eventually comment on, similar to the way that Hounds are signaled. Unlike Hounds, the Deerclops will not follow the player wherever they go, the player can move away and, with skill, leave the Deerclops behind to despawn when Winter ends.

The Deerclops has an attack in which it will either swipe or pound the floor at its current target. Both animations have the same effect (the animation seen depends on which direction Deerclops is facing), damaging all mobs and structures within a radius of about 2.5 berry bushes.

## Hunting

The Deerclops can be kited, a process by which the player attacks, moves away to avoid an attack, then attacks again. It is possible to strike the Deerclops three times in between attacks, or four times if the player is walking over cobblestones or road, or can quickly equip a Walking Cane.

## World Customization

Deerclops attack frequencies may be adjusted in World Customization as follows:

| Option     | Number of Attacks per Season | Attacks During Summer? |
|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| None       | 0                            | No                    |
| Default    | 1                            | No                    |
| Less       | 1                            | No                    |
| More       | 2                            | No                    |
| Lots       | 3                            | Yes                   |

## Reign of Giants

In the Reign of Giants DLC, Deerclops is now the giant of Winter, gaining the ability to freeze its victims. It will take two hits from the Deerclops to freeze either the player or a mob, the first hit will turn the target blue and the next one will freeze it.

## Trivia

- The Deerclops was added in A Winter's Tale update.
- The name "Deerclops" is a portmanteau of "Deer" and "Cyclops".
- Artwork of the Deerclops can be used as a rare Steam profile wallpaper.
- Despite being a monster, the Deerclops drops normal meat rather than monster meat.
- Even though other characters refer to the Deerclops as male, Wurt calls it a female.

# Bees

## Overview
Bees are neutral mobs that spawn from Beehives and Bee Boxes. Their primary function is honey production. If provoked, they will defend the hive.

### Attributes
- **Naughtiness:** 1
- **Health:** 100
- **Damage:** 10
- **Drops:**
  - Honey: 16%
  - Stinger: 80%
  - Blueprint for Bundling Wrap: 4%
- **Attack Period:** 2
- **Attack Range:** 0.6
- **Walk Speed:** 4
- **Run Speed:** 6
- **Special Ability:** Pollinates Flowers.
- **Spawn From:** Beehive, Bee Box, Bee Mine
- **Spawn Code:** "bee"
- **Icon:** Bee.png
- **Stack:** 20
- **Spoil:** DS: Does not spoil, All DLC: 2 days
- **Dropped By:** Tumbleweed (0.1% ×3)

### Quotes
- Wilson: "To bee or not to bee."
- Willow: "It's fat, but that stinger looks dangerous."
- Wolfgang: "Is fat and angry-looking."
- Wendy: "I'd steer clear of that stinger."
- WX78: "A MINDLESS DRONE. I LIKE HIM."
- Wickerbottom: "Apis mellifera. Quite large!"
- Woodie: "She's making the flowers grow."
- Maxwell: "They work so hard, the fools."
- Wagstaff: "I am oddly intrigued by its sadistic nature."
- Wigfrid: "Wee warriörs! I dön't knöw if I like them."
- Webber: "Always Be Pollinating."
- Walani: "Well 'bzz bzz' to you, too!"
- Warly: "Where there are bees, there is honey!"
- Woodlegs: "A honey-makin' devil."
- Wilba: "WHATFORE FOOLS THESE MORTAL BEES!"
- Wormwood: "Buzz!"
- Wheeler: "Flying is wasted on insects."
- Winona: "She's an incredible worker."
- Wortox: "Buzz buzz buzz, tiny bee!"
- Wurt: "Buzzy stinger."
- Walter: "Heh... sure wish I wasn't deathly allergic to them!"
- Wanda: "It's thinking about stinging me, I can see it in its beady eyes."

### Behavior
Bees travel between their nest and nearby Flowers during the Day. They leave their nest in the morning and return home at Dusk or when they have collected pollen from 6 different sources. The closer the Flowers are to the nest, the faster the Bees will produce Honey for Bee Boxes.

### Combat
When killed, Bees drop either 1 Honey or Stinger and increase the player's Naughtiness by 1 point.

### Usage
Bees can be caught with Bug Net. Starving bees can be fed with food, like Rot.

### Tips
The optimal way to get a large number of bees is to burn bee boxes and put out the fire with Ice Flingomatics. All the bees evacuated from bee boxes will be normal bees that are available to capture, and if they are captured quickly, no killer bees will spawn.

# Killer Bee

## Overview
Killer Bees are an aggressive variant of Bees. They spawn from regular Beehives, Killer Bee Hives, and Bee Boxes when attacked or when a Bee is caught with a bug net nearby.

## Description
Maxwell's Door is an indestructible [[Structure]] that always appears in a vanilla or **Reign of Giants** world. It is located in a **Set Piece** on the Surface, consisting of a circle of **Forest Turf**, filled with **Evergreen**s and **Evil Flower**s. It resembles the machine that **Maxwell** tricked **Wilson** into building, as seen in the **Forgotten Knowledge** animated short, and is a portal resembling Maxwell's face when opened. The interior of the door shows a red void filled with shadowy lines. A **Divining Rod** can be used to help locate it.

The Door serves as an entryway to **Adventure Mode**. Upon interacting with it, the player will be warned of the contents of Adventure Mode and be asked if they are sure they want to proceed. If they choose to use the Door, a pair of **Shadow Hand**s will grab the player and pull them into the ground, causing the player to wake up in Chapter 1 of Adventure Mode. The player cannot take any items or prototyped recipes (with the exception of character-specific items such as **Willow's Lighter**, **Abigail's Flower**, or **Lucy**) with them, but their stats will be fully restored. If the player dies in Adventure Mode, they will awaken outside the Door with their original stats, inventory, and prototyped recipes, as if they never went through the Door.

## Trivia
- Maxwell's Door was added to the game with the **Doorway to Adventure** update.
- Getting close to the Door, a faint version of the **Ragtime** song can be heard (referring to the epilogue of Adventure Mode, with the **Gramaphone**).
