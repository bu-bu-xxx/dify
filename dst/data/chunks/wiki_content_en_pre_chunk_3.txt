# Infused Iron

## Exclusivity: Hamlet

- **HP Restored**: 10
- **Hunger Restored**: 1
- **Sanity Restored**: 0
- **Stack**: 40
- **Dropped By**: <img src="Large Iron Hulk.png" width="32px"> Large Iron Hulk
- **Spawn Code**: "infused_iron"
- **Spoil**: 2 days (turns into <img src="Iron Ore.png" width="24px"> Iron Ore)

### Quotes
- **Wilson**: Metal touched with science.
- **Willow**: Are you supposed to be special or something?
- **Wolfgang**: Is strong and glowing.
- **Wendy**: Nothing surprises me anymore.
- **WX-78**: NEW COMPONENTS ACQUIRED
- **Wickerbottom**: Perhaps there is something I can build from this.
- **Woodie**: I still prefer wood.
- **Maxwell**: Hello... Let's see what I can make with this.
- **Wagstaff**: Ferrous metal infused with a kind of ancient arcane technology.
- **Wigfrid**: It glöws with a warriör's spirit.
- **Webber**: We could make something cool with this.
- **Walani**: Whoa. It's got a weird glow.
- **Warly**: Iron marinated in magic.
- **Woodlegs**: 'as th'look 'o treasure to't.
- **Wilba**: ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NAUGHT IRON
- **Wormwood**: Oh... shiny
- **Wheeler**: Was it glowing like that before?
- **Choose**: Wigfrid

### Usage
Infused Iron is a resource introduced in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. It is exclusively obtained from the Large Iron Hulk and used solely to craft the Living Artifact. Infused Iron spoils and will turn into regular Iron Ore after two days.

#### Recipe
- **Item 1**: Infused Iron
- **Count 1**: 6
- **Item 2**: Magic Water
- **Tool**: Blueprint
- **Result**: Living Artifact

### Tips
Like Food items, Infused Iron spoils faster on the ground. Putting it in a valid refrigerating container (like an Insulated pack or a Sea Sack) halves its spoiling rate.

### Trivia
Infused Iron is one of three items that spoil into an item other than Rot, Spoiled Fish, or Rotten Eggs, the others being Tea and Infused Moon Shards from DST.

# {{See also|Portable Crock Pot|text= for [[Warly]]'s unique cooking recipes.}}

The following is a list of [[Crock Pot]] recipes.

The ingredients with a numeric value (like 1.0) represent how many of ingredient from that [[Food Value]] is needed (such as {{pic24|Vegetables}} x 0.5). The icons without values are specific ingredients (such as {{pic24|Honey}}). Required ingredients are the minimum food items to make a dish, and the player can fill the rest of the Crock Pot slots with ingredients that are not restricted.

A calculator to show what dishes can be made from given ingredients can be found [here](https://keckrich.github.io/). For players on PC/Steam, several mods can help to predict the recipe result, and one of them is [Craft Pot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=727774324/).

## {{pic32|Priority}} Priority

Priority ratings decides the result of a particular cooking session based on the ingredients used; the highest rated recipe will always be chosen. If there are several valid recipes with the same priority, a random one of those specific recipes will be chosen. Some recipes have priority of 0 or below, which means they will never be chosen over recipes of positive priority. One such recipe is Wet Goop, which is in fact always a valid result, but it's never chosen over anything else because it has -2 priority.

As a simple example, cooking with 4 [[Meat]] pieces, both the [[Meatballs]] recipe (priority -1) and the [[Meaty Stew]] recipe (priority 0) are valid, but the completed dish will always be Meaty Stew, because of greater priority.

If there are more than one recipe with highest priority, the game will pick at random. Here is a final example; a dish that uses {{pic24|Fish}}{{pic24|Frog Legs}}{{pic24|Corn}}{{pic24|Twigs}} as ingredients fulfills ''four different'' recipes: [[Fishsticks]] (10), [[Fish Tacos]] (10), [[Kabobs]] (5), and [[Froggle Bunwich]] (1); two dishes tie, so the result will be [[Fishsticks]] 50% of the time, and the other 50% [[Fish Tacos]].

## Spawning Mechanics
A Beehive will (re)spawn a new Bee every game hour (30 seconds) up to the maximum population of 6 Bees per hive. Bees will leave their hive during the daytime, one at a time every 50 seconds. They return to their hive at dusk. During Winter, Bees do not leave their hive.

A Killer Bee Hive will (re)spawn a new Bee every 20 seconds up to the maximum population of 6 per hive. Killer Bees normally stay inside their hive all day. If the player wanders too close to their home they will immediately swarm out and attack even at Night and during Winter. Other creatures do not trigger this behavior.

## Trivia
- Killer Bee Hives were added in "A Little Rain Must Fall" update.
- The Killer Bee Hive is called a Wasp Hive in the game files, meaning that Killer Bees could be Wasps. This is made more likely by the fact that their hives resemble wasp hives.
- Killer Bee Hives found in Sandbox Mode will sometimes spawn near the Wooden Thing, as if it were some sort of defense.
- There is a Set Piece consisting of a neat field of Grass with Killer Bee Hives among the tufts.
- In the early stages of the Adventure Mode chapter, Archipelago, there would be a Killer Bee Hive right next to a certain Wormhole, but this was later changed so the player could have a chance.
- Killer Bees and Bees are technically the same species, due

# Wortox

### Character Overview
- **Exclusivity**: Don't Starve Together
- **Nickname**: The Soul Starved
- **Motto**: "Pardon me if I don't shake your hand."
- **Health**: 200
- **Hunger**: 175
- **Sanity**: 150
- **Birthday**: March 28
- **Favorite Food**: Pomegranate and Sliced Pomegranate
- **Survivability**: Grim
- **Starting Item**: Soul ×6
- **Spawn Code**: wortox
- **Links**: [Quotes](Wortox quotes), [Clothes](Wortox clothes)

### Biography
Wortox is a mischievous imp whose levity masks a deep well of guilt. He has taken many souls in his time.

### Perks
- Is an imp
- Can hop through time and space
- Less nourished by physical food

### Origin
Wortox was once a gentle (if rascally) forest creature without a care in the world -- until the day he inherited a terrible curse, and lost a close friend. Unlike the other Survivors, he does not appear to be trapped in the Constant. Perhaps he views this as some sort of game?

### Trivia
- Wortox has been in the game files for Don't Starve since at least December 2012.
- His voice is a violin.
- Wortox is one of three characters to have more than one ghost transformation.
- He is the second DST-exclusive character after Winona.
- Wortox is the second DST character to receive a special idle animation.
- Wortox's birthday is listed as March 28 in the Compendium, the day he was added to DST.

### Cultural References
- Imps are mythological creatures known for their prankish nature.
- The name Wortox is also used by a Swedish Death Metal band.
- Wortox being voiced by a violin may reference the cultural association of the violin with the devil.
- His old design resembled Hellboy.
- Wortox's favorite food, Pomegranate, may reference the myth of Hades and Persephone.

### Lore
- Wortox is described as "a fun, mischievous fellow with a big, kind heart… minus the fact that he eats souls for sustenance."
- Wortox wasn't trapped in the Constant; he arrived through the Ancient Gateway.
- Wortox may know who the Ancient Statue depicts.
- Wortox has a mother.
- Wortox's quotes reveal parts of his nature as an imp, including his sensitivity to the sound of the Lucky Whistle, his inability to cry, and possibly hatching from an egg.

### Quotes
- "Oh, we're going to have some fun!"

The **Green Gem** is an **item** used to craft two **Ancient** items. It can be used to craft the **Construction Amulet**, which raises **Sanity** as well as halves the resource cost of crafting items, and the **Deconstruction Staff**, which can be used to destroy structures/items and receive all of the resources used in their construction (barring **Gems**).

### Gathering
Green Gems can be obtained by mining **Ancient Statue**s, destroying **Broken Clockworks**, breaking certain **Relics**, opening **Ornate Chest**s, and **hammer**ing **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**s in the **Ruins**.

### Downloadable Content
In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, Green Gems have a 0.02% chance to be dropped by **Tumbleweed**s.

In the **Hamlet** DLC, there is a very low chance for Green Gems to drop by hammering **Smashing Pots**.

### Usage

- **Ingredients:**

# Year of the Beefalo

![Year of the Beefalo promo](Year%20of%20the%20Beefalo%20promo.jpg)

| Dates       | 2021: Feb 4 - Mar 11 |

| Developer   | Klei Entertainment |
| Preceded by | Year of the Carrat  |
| Succeeded by| Year of the Catcoon |

**Year of the Beefalo** is an event in **Don't Starve Together** that began on February 4th, 2021. It is inspired by the Chinese Year of the Ox, which starts on February 12, 2021 and ends on January 31, 2022. In the Chinese zodiac, each year is related to an animal in a 12-year cycle.

It is similar to the Year of the Gobbler, Year of the Varg, Year of the Pig King, and Year of the Carrat events, which came in the years before, and shares mechanics with them, such as the Offerings crafting filter, and most crafted items from those events. However, there are several additions and differences to be implemented into this event. Players can revisit this event by setting **Events** to **Year of the Beefalo** in the **World Customization** menu.

During the official Year of the Beefalo event, the Festive Saddle Skin was given to players upon opening the game.

## Beefalo Pageant

Competing in a Beefalo Pageant is the only method of obtaining Lucky Gold Nuggets during the event. It can be initiated by hitching a Beefalo at a Beefalo Stage and talking to the judge at the Judge's Booth during the day. Only one contest can occur each day. You need at least 4 beefalo stages to start the pageant. If there are not enough players to Beefalo Stages, the extra stages will be occupied with Merman and Pig competitors with their own Beefalos. To initiate a pageant, all participating players have to hitch their beefalos to a Beefalo Stage. Beefalos cannot be hitched to anything if they are in heat. Once all participating beefalos are hitched, a player has to activate the Judge's Booth.

Once the contest begins, the Judge will tell the contestants what kind of beefalo he is looking for to be the winner. Then, the players choose the beefalo they believe matches the Judge's criteria. They only have a set amount of time to choose. Players choose by clicking on the beefalo or beefalo's stage, which places a ribbon. The choice is not set until the timer ends, so players

- **wx78**: DEBUGGING RESIDUE

- **wilba**: FUEL O' HEEBIE-GEEBIES
- **wormwood**: Dark Floaty Man
- **wheeler**: A perfectly normal fuel source made of dark souls.
- **choose**: maxwell

**Nightmare Fuel** is a **Refined** **Item** used in the ways of **Shadow Tab** and **Ancient** **Magic**. It requires a **Prestihatitator** to prototype and costs 4 **Dark Petals** to craft. It can also be obtained as a drop from various mobs and objects.

Aside from being used to craft magic items, it is also used to fuel **Night Lights** and **Maxwell/Character**'s **Codex Umbra** (to summon Shadow Puppets). **Chester** can transform into **Shadow Chester** by placing Nightmare Fuel in each of his nine inventory slots during a **Full Moon**.

**Gathering**

See also: **Guides/Nightmare Fuel Farming**

If a Survivors's **Sanity** decreases below 40% of their maximum (100 for **Wickerbottom**, 80 for most characters, 48 for **Willow**, 30 for **Wes**, and varies for **WX-78** based on the upgrade level), all **Rabbit**s change into Beardlings and can be killed to gather Nightmare Fuel (along with **Monster Meat** and **Beard Hair**). An easy way to do this is by **trap**ping a large number of Rabbits and then lowering Sanity to below 40%, after which they can all be murdered all at once while in inventory. However, be careful, as this is liable to trigger the **Krampus** by advancing the player's naughtiness level beyond the threshold.

Alternatively, Nightmare Fuel can be acquired by killing **Crawling Horrors** and **Terrorbeaks**. **Crawling Horrors** are easier to deal with than **Terrorbeaks**; the latter don't appear until Sanity is very, very low, so it's possible to kill **Crawling Horrors** one at a time.

A safer and simpler way to get Nightmare Fuel is to capture **Bee**s with a **Bug Net** and then release them at an **Evil Flower** patch, which can be found where the **Things** and **Maxwell's Door** are. This will eventually cause more Evil Flowers to spawn, and their **Dark Petal** petals can be crafted into Nightmare Fuel.

Perhaps the most dangerous yet lucrative way is to venture into a **Ruins** or **Cave** and find a location with **Nightmare Lights** and **Nightmare Fissure**s. When the **Nightmare Cycle** ends, all of the Shadow Creatures that spawned from the Lights and Fissures will die and drop Nightmare Fuel.

**Downloadable Content**

In the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC, Nightmare Fuel can be obtained by hammering **Pig Head**s and **Merm Head**s during a **Moon Cycle | Full Moon**.

In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, Nightmare Fuel can also be acquired by

### Quote
"ADVENTURE LIE'ETH YONDER!" - Wilba

Wilba is a playable **Character** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. She is the daughter of **Queen Malfalfa**, making her the Princess of the Pig kingdom. She has also inherited the **curse** of being a **Werepig** from her father. Wilba is the only **Hamlet** character that cannot be unlocked via Experience.

- **Special Ability:** Can become playable when the **Pig Queen** is given the **Royal Crown**.

Wilba starts as a passive, non-attacking **Mob** in the Souvenir Shop located two rooms to the left in the **Royal Palace** on the second island. She tells the player that she lost the **Royal Crown** and is therefore grounded. The player must kill the **Queen Womant** and mine its throne with a **Pickaxe** to get the **Royal Crown**. Return the **Royal Crown** to the Pig Queen. Once the player does this, Wilba will be unlocked as a playable character and disappear from her room.

#### Quotes

  - HAVE'ST THOU THE CROWN?
  - WHEREFORE IS'T THE CROWN?
  - WILBA 'TIS STUCK'ETH IN MINE CAGE
  - WILBA LOST'DED YON CROWN

- **Given Royal Crown:**

  - 'TIS NAUGHT WILBA'S
  - GIVE'ST THEE TO MAMA

### Trivia
- Wilba was added to the Early Access of **Don't Starve: Hamlet** on November 8, 2018.
- Wilba's voice is played by an Ocarina.
- In the forum post introducing her as a playable character, she is described as follows: "Daughter to Queen Malfalfa, Princess Wilba has the love of her people. If only she wanted the job. She would much rather be out in the world exploring and soaking up life, even if she still requires a nightlight when she gets tucked in."
- Wilba's style of speech is a parody of archaic (Shakespeare's) English. Other **Don't Starve: Hamlet** Pigs also speak this way.
- The player is able to kill Wilba before unlocking her in the Palace. She will drop one **Pig Skin** and one **Meat**. Once she has been killed, she will never respawn, forcing the player to create another world to unlock her.
- Before the Character Update, her perks read as follows: "Is a pig. Is royalty. Is afraid of the dark."
- Wilba, **Wormwood**, **Wortox**, and **Wurt** may be the first survivors to originate from the **The Constant** itself and not the real world like the others.
- Her hair, skirt, and bow have bones, as shown when struck by lightning.

# Light Flowers

Light Flowers are plants that serve as sources of light that can normally be found in [[Caves]] and [[Ruins]]. They are generated all over the caves but mostly spawn in Cave Swamp, and [[Wilds]] in the Ruins.

**Can Be Burned:** 1

## Quotes

- **Wortox:** How kind of you to light my way.
- **Wurt:** Useless flower, florph.
- **Walter:** Will I start glowing if I eat it?
- **Wanda:** I don't have time to stop and smell the flowers.

## Details

Light Bulbs can be picked from Light Flowers. There are three types of light flowers, each yielding a different number of Light Bulbs.

The Light Flower is a small light source, capable of protecting the player from Charlie's attacks. It ceases to act as a light source once picked. The double- and triple-bulb plants yield 2 and 3 bulbs respectively when picked. It takes 3 days for a flower with one bulb to regrow, 4-5 days for a two-bulbed flower, and 6 days to spawn a three-bulbed flower.

Light Flowers cannot be relocated elsewhere with a shovel, and are thus limited to their natural habitat in Caves and Ruins.

## Trivia

* Light Flowers were added in the Underground update.

# Tumbleweed

## Description
A **Tumbleweed** is a form of flora found in the **Reign of Giants** DLC. They spawn from an invisible spawner in the **Desert** biome and can be found tumbling around, often in groups; they may also tumble from a Desert into nearby biomes. **Catcoon**s can also spit up Tumbleweeds. When the player is near a Tumbleweed, it will make a musical sound.

## Properties
- **Image**: ![Tumbleweed](Tumbleweed.png)
- **Can be Burned**: Yes
- **Picked**: Can be picked.
- **Resources**: See below
- **Renew**: Yes
- **Biome**: Desert
- **Spawn Code**: "tumbleweed"
- **Spawner**: c_spawn ("Tumbleweedspawner")

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Who knows what that tumbleweed has picked up."
- Willow: "It looks highly flammable."
- Wolfgang: "Come back little tumbling ball!"
- Wendy: "Alone and rolling through life."
- WX78: "IT COULD CONTAIN MANY THINGS."
- Wickerbottom: "A dried collection of plant matter."
- Woodie: "I wish it was sturdier so I could chop it."
- Maxwell: "Tumble on, weed."
- Wagstaff: "What mysteries are within that mobile sphere of branches?"
- Wigfrid: "Flee, bouncing coward!"
- Webber: "Who knows what that tumbleweed has picked up."
- Walani: "It's on a journey called 'life'."
- Warly: "What secrets do you hold?"
- Woodlegs: "I like me weeds settin' still."
- Wilba: "THE UNDISCOVER'D RUNT TREE."
- Winona: "Rollin' along the road of life."
- Wortox: "Does it know where it wants to go?"
- Wurt: "Where you going?"
- Wormwood: "Come back!"
- Walter: "It's just minding its own business."
- Wanda: "I'm sure it's seen a lot during its travels."
- Wheeler: "The chase is on!"
- Choose: WX78

## Tips
- It is recommended for players to have a weapon prepared when harvesting large amounts of Tumbleweeds as hostile Mobs can spawn on occasion.
- Tumbleweeds can catch on fire if they touch unprotected fires, or spontaneously during Summer like other flammable objects. Burning Tumbleweeds will continue to roll with the same speed, and can ignite anything they come in contact with. Players should make sure their bases or structures are protected by not creating unprotected fires (like Campfires) where Tumbleweeds can spawn. Protected fires, such as a Firepit, will not ignite nearby flammable objects.
- The Magma Pools found in the Dragonfly Desert can cause Tumbleweeds to catch fire. It's advisable to build away from the magma pools, or to encase either the Tumbleweed Spawners in walls, or the Magma Pools with walls if you're building anything flammable, and unprotected.
- As Tumbleweeds make Gears and Rare Gems renewable, living close to a desert may provide these items, although they still are extremely rare.
  - This makes the Desert an ideal choice for WX-78 to set up camp early in the game, since they can collect gears without fighting Clockworks until they are prepared to do so.
  - However, rare Gems are also available by killing the Dragonfly in Don't Starve Together, as she drops at least 1 Gem of every type.
- Even without rarer items, Tumbleweeds are a good source of Twigs and Cut Grass during Winter.
- If a player can manage to find the spawn point of the Tumbleweeds, a player can build a "Tumbleweed Farm" by placing walls around the Tumbleweed spawn point, thereby trapping the Tumbleweeds so that the player can collect them.
  - This can be done by creating enclosures randomly in the Desert. Rarely, Tumbleweeds will spawn onscreen, making it easy to locate their spawn point.
  - The prefab code of the spawner is `tumbleweedspawner`.

## Trivia
- Tumbleweeds used to be a possible source of Fireflies. The #103865 revision patch removed this functionality.
- The speed at which Tumbleweeds hop around is relative to the player's current movement speed. This can easily be seen if the player uses console commands to increase their speed.
- Although Tumbleweeds appear to be blown by wind, two nearby Tumbleweeds will not always be blown in the same direction.
- Musical sound made by the Tumbleweed

| Rock Lobster | Loyalty (When hand-fed) | Adds 3 minutes (6 day segments) of Follower time, with questionable efficiency. |
| Moleworm | Nothing! | Though it does delay their starvation. |

### Downloadable Content
In the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC, Orange Gems have a 0.02% chance to be dropped by Tumbleweeds, making them a renewable resource. In **Shipwrecked**, Orange Gems can be found in buried X Marks the Spot treasure chests while in **Hamlet**, there is a very low chance for Orange Gems to drop from hammering A Smashing Pot.

# Crabby Hermit

The Crabby Hermit, also known as Pearl, is a [Mob] exclusive to [Don't Starve Together], introduced in [Return of Them]. She can be found on the [Hermit Island].

## Behavior
The Crabby Hermit goes out of the [Hermit Home] during the day. She roams on her island, performing various tasks, mostly fishing. She will approach and comment while the player is performing a task. She is immune to any damage.

In worlds where daytime is turned off, she will roam her island regardless of the time of day.

## Tasks
Beyond level 1, being in proximity to the Crabby Hermit grants access to the [Bottle Exchange Tab]. More recipes are unlocked at friendship level 3, 6, 8, and 9.

When a task is completed for the first time, the friendship with the Crabby Hermit increases by one level. Each task can be redone several times for extra Bundle of Thanks, but they will not grant extra friendship.

When friendship goes to levels 2, 4, 5, and 7, she gives the player a [Bundle of Thanks]. She also gives a Bundle of Thanks when a task is performed for the second time and for each of the following ones.

The color of the Crabby Hermit's speech is initially light pink. At level 4, the color changes to light magenta. At level 8, the color changes again to light purple, and players will see her as Pearl and her [Hermit Home] as Pearl's Place. At this point, she will also dance when a player performs the dance emote.

After completing 10 tasks, including all three of the Hermit Home upgrades, she will give the player the [Pearl's Pearl].

## Bottle Exchange
Below is a table of the levels of friendship required to unlock each of the Bottle Exchange Filter items.

| Item | Name | Level | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Bundle of Thanks] | Shell Bell Bundle | 1 | ![Empty Bottle (DST)] |
| ![Blueprint (rare)] | Pinchin' Winch Blueprint | 1 | ![Empty Bottle (DST)] |
| ![Blueprint (rare)] | Shell Beach Turf Blueprint | 1 | ![Empty Bottle (DST)] ×3 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Bundle of Thanks
A [Bundle of Thanks] is given by the Crabby Hermit to reward tasks. It contains 8 random Shell Bells, except at level 2 where there aren't any. It also contains 1 [Honey] if the Flower task has been completed.

At level 2, 4, 5, and 7 the Bundle of Thanks also contains one random [Lures] from the following: Rainy Day Lure, Snow Day Lure, Stupefying Lure, and Heavy Weighted Lure, with a 25% chance each.

## Shell Bell Bundle
[Shell Bell Bundle] can be obtained in exchange for 1 [Empty Bottle] in the [Bottle Exchange Tab] of the Crabby Hermit. Shell Bell Bundle contains 4 random Shell Bells with a 40% chance for Soprano Shell Bell, a 40% chance for Alto Shell Bells, and a 20% chance for Baritone Shell Bell.

## Trivia
* The Crabby Hermit and the Bundle of Thanks were introduced in the [Return of Them#She Sells Sea Shells|She Sells Sea Shells] update.
* She appears to be based on [Mary Anning], a fossil collector, paleontologist, and dealer who inspired the popular tongue twister "She sells seashells".
* The name "Crabby Hermit" could be a play on Hermit Crab.

## Description
The Slot Machine is a naturally occurring Structure in Shipwrecked worlds. It can usually be found on a small island with a Mangrove Biome connected to its own Set Piece, on four Wooden Flooring tiles with two Skeletons and two Dubloons lying around. Players can spend a Dubloon to get a random outcome. After the Dubloon is spent, the slots will spin for a moment, then stop in one of the 3 possible configurations. All possibilities, good or bad, spawn a number of Items or Mobs. One rare result will simply refund the used Dubloon. In addition to the Dubloon spent, each spin costs 5 to 40 Sanity.

The Slot Machine cannot be destroyed, however it will not function while being flooded.

## Outcomes

### Skulls (33.3% chance)
- (50% chance) Dubloons or (33.3% chance) Oinc, Tenpiece Oinc, Centapiece Oinc
- Mobs will be spawned.

### Carrots (50% chance)
- (50% chance) Dubloons or (33.3% chance) Oinc, Tenpiece Oinc, Centapiece Oinc
- A selection of basic items will be thrown out.

### Gold Nuggets (16.6% chance)
- A selection of valuable items will be thrown out.

## Downloadable Content
In the Hamlet DLC, an Oinc, Tenpiece Oinc, and Centapiece Oinc can be used as a substitute for a Dubloon to spend into the Slot Machine in a Shipwrecked world with Hamlet compatibility.

## Tips
- Webber will not be attacked by the Spiders spawned by Three Skulls outcome.
- Dubloons are dropped randomly by Parrot Pirates, up to once per day from a Booty Bag, or given by the Yaarctopus in exchange for fish or trinkets, which can be farmed indefinitely.
- During Monsoon Season, the Slot Machine may get flooded by a pool of water, making it unusable until the water disappears. This can be avoided by placing Sandbags around it.
- It is recommended to be armored while gambling at the Slot Machine. Seashell Suit or Horned Helmet are particularly good for this, since there is a chance to get Poison Snakes or Mosquitoes. An alternative is carrying an Anti Venom along with an armor of the player's choice.
- Because there is a chance to get Prime Apes as well, it can be handy to have an item that can stop them and keep them in check, such as an Ice Staff, a Sleep Dart or a Pan Flute to prevent them from stealing any items nearby.
- Elephant Cacti planted next to the Slot Machine will kill any mobs that spawn. Wearing Cactus Armor while gambling will protect the player from AoE damage.

## Trivia
- The insanity effect of the Slot Machine suggests that repeat players may gain a sort of problematic addiction to gambling.

![Charlie and her portal](Charlie and her portal.jpg)

**Be warned, assisting the Shadow Queen will alter your world and cannot be undone. Beautiful, terrible things will rise to the surface. Are you sure you'd like to continue?**

## Activating
After defeating the Ancient Fuelweaver, the Beckoning Hand appears and asks for 5 Dreadstones to be offered. If the player does not offer the 5 Dreadstones, the Beckoning Hand will stay and wait for tribute, so players can offer 5 Dreadstones any time they want. The Beckoning Hand only disappears when the Ancient Key is inserted into the Ancient Gateway. 

Once the player assists Charlie, the world will change irreversibly: The Shadow Rift will spawn periodically.

## Shadow Rift
The Shadow Rift is a dangerous feature that spawns in Caves after assisting Charlie. It has three phases, each with increasing difficulty. It spawns Miasma and Fused Shadelings, and its presence has several effects on the cave world.

- Wormwood: "Anybody down there?"
- Wurt: "Glorp! Ground broken!"
- Walter: "I wish I could get a better look inside..."
- Wanda: "This isn't good..."

- Lurking Nightmare spawn chance increases.
- Mimicreep item will spawn near conforming Items and imitate them in the Night.
- Ickers will spawn when players are near their spawning location.
- Ornate Chests have a chance to be replaced by Ornery Chest when renewing the Ruins.

## Shadow Thralls
Each time the Shadow Rift spawns, a Shadow Thrall is randomly selected to be released into the world. When the player comes near a Nightmare Fissure, it turns into a Dreadstone Outcrop and spawns this kind of Shadow Thralls.

- Jitters, Rasp, and Shrieks.
- Three Rictuses.

# Farm Plants in Don't Starve Together

## Introduction
Farm Plants are objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in **Return of Them**. Plant farming provides **Food** in the form of **Vegetables**, **Fruits**, and to some extent **Crop Seeds**.

## Farming
![Wolfgang in a thriving Potato farm in Don't Starve: Together](DST%20-%20Potato%20farm.PNG)

Farm Plants are obtained by planting **Crop Seeds** or **Seeds** into **Farm Soil**. The seeds have a chance to produce **weeds** instead.

### Growth Stages and Stress
Plants have 5 growth stages: Seeds, Sprout, Small, Medium, and Grown. At each new growth stage, the plant may gain **Plant Stress** points depending on its condition. The total accumulated stress changes the output of a grown plant:

- From 0 to 1 stress point, the plant grows a **Giant Crop**.
- From 2 to 6 stress points, the plant gives 1 normal product and 2 crop seeds.
- From 7 to 11 stress points, the plant gives 1 normal product and 1 crop seed.
- From 12 or more, the plant gives 1 normal product.

The growth rate of the plant depends on its level of stress: The greater the stress, the slower the growth. Only the stress level gained at the beginning of each stage counts. Growth is twice as fast if the season is one of the plant's favorite seasons. Farm plants only grow in the presence of daylight, i.e., during **day** and **dusk** on the surface, near the natural light from the ceiling in the **Caves**, or near a **Dwarf Star**.

### Stress Sources
There are 7 sources of stress for farm plants. The condition of the plant is checked at the beginning of each new stage (sprout, small, medium, and growth), it can accumulate up to 28 stress points.

#### Ground Nutrient
There are 3 types of **Nutrients** and each farm soil tile contains some amount of each nutrient. At the end of each growth stage, farm plants consume and produce nutrients. If the farm soil tile contains fewer nutrients than the plant requires, the plant accumulates 1 stress point and produces fewer nutrients itself.

Weeds only consume nutrient and produce none. **Fertilizer** can be used to increase nutrients in the ground. Because only farm soil tiles can contain nutrients, seeds planted by Wormwood on other tiles will always accumulate 4 nutrient stress points. Nutrient levels can be made easier to see by wearing the **Premier Gardeneer Hat**. Wormwood can naturally see nutrient levels without the aid of the hat.

#### Ground Moisture
At each stage, if the plant was on wet ground for less than 10% of the time since the previous stage, it accumulates 1 stress point.

* Each tile has its own moisture, from 0 to 100 points; a non-zero moisture value makes it "wet ground".
* Each use of a **Watering Can**, a **Waterfowl Can**, or a **Water Balloon** will add 25 points of moisture. **Ice** melting will add 20 points of moisture. **Rain** increases moisture at up to 1.5 points per second depending on the rain rate.
* Moisture naturally decreases, depending on the world temperature, with no drying below 0° to 0.05 points per seconds above 70°, regardless of the time of day.

#### Killjoys
At the end of each growth stage, the plant accumulates 1 stress point if there are rotten plants, **Garden Detritus**, rotten giant crops, or weeds within 1.5 tiles.

#### Season
At the end of each growth stage, if the current season is not one of the plant's favorites, the plant accumulates 1 stress point.

Additionally, Crops will grow twice as quickly when grown during their preferred Seasons.

#### Family
At the end of each growth stage, the plant accumulates 1 stress point if there are less than 4, including the one checking, of the same type within 1 tile.

#### Overcrowding
At the end of each growth stage, the plant accumulates 1 stress point if there are more than 10 farm plants or weeds on the same tile.

#### Happiness
At each growth stage, if the plant was not attended to since the last stage, the plant accumulates 1 stress point. Plants can be attended manually by the player (unless playing as Wes as he is unable to talk), a **Friendly Fruit Fly** or by using items that attend to all plants within their range (see table).

The Cactus Armor is a craftable Armor introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It can be crafted with 1 Log Suit and 3 Cactus Spike, and requires an Alchemy Engine or Sea Lab to prototype. It has 450 durability and absorbs 80% of physical damage like the Log Suit used to craft it. Whenever a Character wearing the Cactus Armor is hit by a Mob, it will deal 17 damage to the attacker, even if the attack was projectile such as those used by MacTusk or Clockwork Bishop. This damage is not affected by characters with damage modifiers. Unlike the Log Suit, the Cactus Armor is non-flammable. Wearing the armor will cause the Elephant Cactus to ignore the player, and grants immunity to its attack, but attacking it with a Melee Weapon still does damage to the player.

## Tips
- Cactus Armor's ability is not useful while on a boat, since the vessel is the one that takes full damage. This means critters such as Stink Rays, Ballphins, Floaty Boaty Knights or Crocodogs won't get hurt when attacking the armored player on the sea.
  - This even includes Jellyfish, despite being the only sea critter that can harm the player's health directly.
- Shadow Creatures do take damage when attacking the player. However, they won't disappear and respawn in the proximity of the player when successfully hit, as they usually do.

## Trivia
- The Cactus Armor was added in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#February 25, 2016 - Release the Quacken Update.

In DST, Wigfrid has all the abilities from *Don't Starve* alongside additional abilities exclusive to DST.

## Abilities

Wigfrid is now able to eat food items classified as "goodies", such as [Taffy], [Jellybeans], and [Volt Goat Chaud-Froid], not counting special event food.

She gains Health and Sanity from attacking mobs based on the damage before the 25% bonus (instead of killing), `Health & sanity gain = Mob's damage × 0.25 × (original damage ÷ Mob's Health)`.

For example, if she attacks a [Spider] with the Battle Spear, she gains 2.125 Health and Sanity per hit (20 × 0.25 × (42.5 ÷ 100) = 2.125).

![Inspiration Meter](Inspiration_Meter.png)

Wigfrid has a unique Inspiration meter, which allows her to perform her [Battle Songs]. Wigfrid's Inspiration level rises when fighting foes, giving up to 2.4 Inspiration points for every 100 damage inflicted. Fighting bosses grants triple that amount, up to 7.2 Inspiration for every 100 points of damage. The amount of gained Inspiration lowers depending on the current amount of Inspiration, scaling down the higher the current Inspiration percentage is.

`Inspiration gain = damage × 0.024 × (1 - current percentage of inspiration) (×3 if Boss)`

It is important to note that the damage variable in the above equation is the actual damage inflicted. This means that all damage modifiers such as her own 25% damage bonus, Volt Goat Chaud-Froid, [Chili Flakes](spicy foods) or even damage reduction from enemies will affect the amount of inspiration she gains.

Wigfrid also gains Inspiration when receiving damage from mobs.

`Inspiration gain = health loss × 0.024 × (1 - percentage of inspiration)`

After 7.5 seconds without gaining Inspiration, Wigfrid loses 2 Inspiration every second.

Wigfrid has exclusive access to the [Stagecraft Tab] to craft the Battle Songs. She can sing up to 3 Battle Songs at a time (unlocked at 16.6, 50 and 83.3 Inspiration respectively) to apply various buffs to her and all surrounding players. Each battle song remains active until the Inspiration falls below the corresponding unlock threshold.

There are five battle songs:
- The [Weaponized Warble] makes weapons drain durability 25% slower, or 0.75× the normal rate.
- The [Heartrending Ballad] provides +1 hp per hit for all other players nearby, while Wigfrid players gain additional +0.5 hp per hit.
- The [Clear Minded Cadenza] provides +1 sanity for nearby players for each hit they land on enemies.
- The [Bel Canto of Courage] reduces sanity drain by half for nearby players.
- The [Fireproof Falsetto] provides immunity against fire damage.

There are also two instant Battle Songs that apply a one-time effect at the cost of 16.6 Inspiration:
- The [Rude Interlude] focuses nearby enemies' attention on Wigfrid.
- The [Startling Soliloquy] startles nearby enemies, sending them into

- **Wanda**: It's trying to drain the life right out of me!

## Hunting

The most effective way to deal with Mosquitoes is to capture them with a [[Bug Net]]. When caught, the Mosquito will turn into an [[Item]] in the player's [[Inventory]], which can be Murdered for a 50% chance of getting a Mosquito Sack. Due to their fast flying speed, Mosquitoes are difficult to hit with melee [[weapons]]. When hit, the Mosquito will be "stunlocked" and spin around for a moment before recovering. This makes them very easy to kill in a 1v1 fight.

## Damage Table

| Weapon | No. of hits for<br />{{pic32|Mosquito}} |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| Fishing Rod, Bug Net | 24 |
| Lucy the Axe | 6 |
| Shovel, Pitchfork | 4 |
| Hammer, Torch, Umbrella | 3 |
| Walking Cane, Willow's Lighter | 2-4 |
| Axe, Pickaxe | 2 or 3 |
| Luxury Axe, Opulent Pickaxe | 2 |
| Boomerang, PickSlashAxe | 1 |
| Spear, Bat Bat | 1 |

Mosquitoes take one blast from the [[Ice Staff]] to be frozen and one [[Sleep Dart]] to be put to sleep.

## Downloadable Content

In all [[DLC]]s, Mosquitoes inside the player's inventory will starve in 2 days unless fed. They can be fed with anything edible to the player, even [[Mandrake]]s, [[Deerclops Eyeball]]s, [[Rot]], and such.

In the ''[[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]]'' DLC, Mosquitoes can be collected by harvesting [[Tumbleweed]]s.

In the [[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]] DLC, Mosquitoes are replaced by their [[Poison Mosquito|Poisonous]] variant, spawning from puddles and [[Mangrove]]s in [[Seasons/Monsoon|

- Walter: "Are there any bugs on it?"
- Wanda: "I have far more pressing things to do than pick flowers."
- Choose: Maxwell

## Description

Flowers are found in Grasslands, Forests, or Savanna biomes. They cannot be found in Marshes or Rockyland. When picked, they restore 5 Sanity and produce Petals, which, when eaten, restore 1 Health. There are 10 different kinds of Flowers, but they all have the same effect.

Flowers serve a variety of purposes. Picking 12 of them for their Petals allows the creation of a Garland, which provides a Sanity boost over time in addition to the 5 Sanity gained from picking each Flower. This is especially useful early on in the game.

Flowers also spawn Butterflies, which can be killed for their Butterfly Wings or Butter, or be captured in a Bug Net. Captured Butterflies can be planted anywhere to produce a new Flower, thus making each of these items renewable. Homeless Bees can also produce Flowers over time, after pollinating 6 Flowers. Many Flowers can be planted together to build a Butterfly farm, an area where Butterflies can easily be killed for their wings. Large groups of Flowers are also useful for Honey production. Building Bee Boxes near such fields increases the speed at which the Bees produce Honey.

## Cultivation

Flowers can be manually cultivated by planting living Butterflies. Using a Bug Net to capture any number of Butterflies, the player can right click them on the ground to plant them as they would plant Pine Cones or Grass Tufts. One Butterfly can be planted to create one Flower in a location of the player's choosing. The physical area occupied by the Flower is very small, allowing for densely planted Flower gardens.

Cultivation of Flowers is of interest because of their Sanity bonus when picked and use for Crafting the Garland and the Pretty Parasol, however the long term use of cultivation is the creation of efficient Honey farms through the use of Bee Boxes, for which an ample supply of Flowers is necessary.

Because Flowers spawn Butterflies, cultivation of a large Flower bed can usually proceed very quickly, provided the player has sufficient materials to build new Bug Nets.

## Downloadable Content

In all DLCs, new Flowers will spawn without the aid of Butterflies or Bees in the Rain. During a full moon, Flowers will turn into Evil Flowers, and return to normal afterwards.

# Dumbrella
The Dumbrella is a **Dress Item** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC and serves as a counterpart to the Eyebrella in the **Reign of Giants** DLC. It can be crafted using 2 **Shark Gills**, an **Umbrella**, and a **Straw Hat**, and requires an **Alchemy Engine** or **Sea Lab** to prototype. It can also be found within a **Steamer Trunk**. A **Sewing Kit** repairs 41% of its durability.

## Attributes
- **Equip Slot:** Head
- **Water Resistance:** 100% resistance
- **Overheating Resistance:** 240
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** "double_umbrellahat"
- **Durability:** 12 days
- **Perk:** Delays overheating in Dry Season. Protects from Rain and Lightning. Protects from Jellyfish electrocution.

## Crafting Ingredients
- **Ingredient 1:** Shark Gills (Multiplier: 2)
- **Ingredient 2:** Umbrella (Multiplier: 1)
- **Ingredient 3:** Straw Hat (Multiplier: 1)

## Quotes
- **Wolfgang:** "Two umbrellas is better than one."
- **Wilson:** "The second umbrella keeps the first umbrella dry."
- **Willow:** "If I bought this in a store I'd feel burned."
- **Woodie:** "Double the protection!"
- **Maxwell:** "This looks silly."

- **Wilba:** "HATH TWICE THE FANCIES!"
- **Wormwood:** "Two Times Rain Taker"
- **Wheeler:** "I'll be twice as sure to forget it at home now."

## Trivia
- The word "Dumbrella" is a combination of "double" and "umbrella", purposefully spelling "dumb" to indicate the strange look of the item, despite it being very practical.
- Before it was made craftable with Shark Gills in the **Eye of the Tiger Shark** update, the Dumbrella had altered colors of blue and white, instead of orange and white, with additional black stripes.

# Nutrients (Don't Starve Together Exclusive Feature)

Nutrients are a feature exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in **Return of Them**. Nutrients are present in the ground of **Farm Soil**. They are important components in the growth of **Farm Plants**. There are 3 types of nutrients: **Growth Formula**, **Compost**, and **Manure**.

## Quotes on Nutrients
- Wilson: "This poor plant needs nutrients!"
- Willow: "Ms. Wickerbottom's always going on about nutrients in the soil. Maybe it needs that."
- Wolfgang: "Is hungry! What do plants like to eat..."
- Wendy: "It is starved for nutrients."
- WX78: "SUB-OPTIMAL SOIL DETECTED. NUTRIENTS REQUIRED"
- Wickerbottom: "It requires more nutrient-rich soil."
- Woodie: "Might not be enough nutrients in the soil..."
- Maxwell: "Richer soil might be needed."
- Wigfrid: "Yöu are unhappy with the dirt yöu have? Dö nöt löök tö me tö help yöu!"
- Webber: "Maybe it needs some better dirt?"
- Winona: "Better give it some nutrients."
- Warly: "Some fresh nutrients might be just the thing to perk it up."
- Wortox: "It needs better soil or our hard work will be spoiled!"
- Wormwood: "Needs food!"
- Wurt: "Need plant food."
- Walter: "Maybe it needs some better soil..."
- Wanda: "I'm sure I gave it some fertilizer not too long ago... or maybe I will soon."
- Choose: Webber
- Source: examining a plant in need of nutrients.

## Cycle
Each tile can contain up to 100 points of each nutrient. The initial value is random, between 20 to 40 points for each nutrient. Farm plants consume one type of nutrient and produce the other two in return (see [Farm Plant](#)). The cycle conserves the total amount of nutrient but the relative quantities of each nutrient will change depending on the consumption or production. Weeds consume nutrients when growing but they do not produce nutrients in return (see [Weeds](#)). They decrease the total amount of nutrients.

## Fertilizer
Fertilizer can be used to increase the amount of nutrients in the ground. One farm tile can hold up to 100 units of nutrients (or 12.5 "arrows").
