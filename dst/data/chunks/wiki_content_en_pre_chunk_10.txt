## Crafting
The Obsidian Spear is a craftable Weapon exclusive to the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It requires 1 Spear, 3 Obsidian, and 1 Dragoon Heart to craft. It can also be found as a reward from X Marks the Spot treasure chests. Like all items in the Volcanic Tab, it cannot be prototyped and the player must be wearing a Brain of Thought or be near an Obsidian Workbench to craft it again.

## Gameplay
Initially, the Obsidian Spear deals the same damage as a Tentacle Spike per hit, but as the Obsidian Spear is used to attack, it will become charged causing it to deal up to 2x damage when fully charged. It takes approximately 30 hits to reach full charge. As the charge level increases, the Obsidian Spear will also produce more heat and light, which protects the players from Charlie, but can rapidly cause Overheating when unequipped. If dropped into water while sailing, the Obsidian Spear will lose all of its charge. It should be noted that it has a very high durability, 2.5x that of the regular Spear.

Players should take caution when using an Obsidian Spear with high levels of charge, as the targeted Mob is likely to be killed and burn, causing Meat to be cooked and the loots to ignite. Like other Obsidian tools, the Obsidian Spear will not gain any charges during Hurricane Season.

## Tips
- The bonus damage from charging the Obsidian Spear (or Obsidian tools in general) is not affected by character damage modifiers. For example, Wolfgang in max Mighty Form with a fully charged Obsidian Spear deals 153 damage instead of 204.
- The Obsidian Spear, along with the Obsidian Axe and Obsidian Machete, will still gain charges when used in Winter.
  - As the weapon gains charges, the heat and light that it provides makes it an effective weapon to use during the long and cold winter nights. However, since it requires an attackable target to be charged, it may be preferable to carry around an Obsidian Axe and cut down Trees instead.
- The weapon can be charged safely by attacking passive Creatures that can regenerate health such as Chester or Packim Baggims. However, the high damage of the weapon combined with the relatively low health and slow regeneration of the companions makes this process impractical. However, a more practical method is attacking a Lureplant and replanting the Fleshy Bulb

# Safe
The **Safe** is a structure added in **The Gorge** event. Almost identical to the chest: it has 9 slots for items, characters can transfer things from the safe to the inventory only next to it, etc. The main difference is that there are locked safes (and most of them), which must first be opened with a **Key**.

Initially, there are four safes on the map, 1 unlocked and 3 locked. The unlocked one is located near the starting area, for more convenient storage of ingredients and livestock. Locked safes are located in the area of the destroyed city, near the salt ponds. Such safes contain silver dishes (which is characteristically indicated by a plate with a **Sapphire Medallion**) and roomy kitchen utensils, which prompts the opening of the safes. Initially, it may appear that there are only two locked safes marked with a sign, but players may notice another one behind a broken van on the way to the **Mealing Stone**.

The contents of locked safes change every match, but there is always one of three sets in the safe (they are not repeated per match).

Safes are one of the key points of the game, with their help you can get a lot of useful things.

## Item sets in safes
### First safe:
- **Serving (Silver Plate)** x3
- **Large Casserole Dish**
- **Serving (Silver Bowl)**

### Second safe:
- **Serving (Silver Plate)**
- **Large Cookpot**
- **Serving (Silver Bowl)** x2

### Third safe:
- **Serving (Silver Plate)**
- **Serving (Silver Bowl)**
- **Syrup Pot**
- **Tree Tapping Kit** x3

# Ancient Orchestrina

_Exclusive to Don't Starve Together_

## Object Info

- **Image**: ![Archive Orchestrina](Archive Orchestrina.png)
- **Spawn Code**: `archive_orchestrina_base`
- **Biome**: Ancient Archive
- **Perk**: Unlocks ![Distilled Knowledge](Distilled Knowledge).
  
The Ancient Orchestrina is a naturally spawning object exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in the Return of Them. It can be found in the Ancient Archive biome.

## Activation and Puzzle

The Ancient Orchestrina is initially nonfunctioning until activated by the Archive Switch. A player can drop a Distilled Knowledge in the center circle to activate a puzzle.

The puzzle consists of walking onto the 8 outer edge circles in the correct order. The order is numerical, with lights corresponding to the number flashing on the circle once the player steps on it. The order is randomized and must be guessed by trial and error.

Once the puzzle is solved, the Distilled Knowledge is consumed, and the player can learn the associated recipe.

## Trivia

- The Ancient Orchestrina was introduced in the Forgotten Knowledge update.
- The circles on the outer edge could represent phases of the moon.

# Bottle Lantern

- **Perk:** Refuelable portable light.

- **Wheeler:** I'm sure they love it in there.

## Bugs
When placed on the ground, a Bottle Lantern, at full durability, can provide a small range of infinite light. This can happen by waiting for a Bottle Lantern to run out on the ground; when that happens, quit the current game session, relog the save slot with the same Bottle Lantern, and the Bottle Lantern will emit a low range light source. This can be undone by simply picking up the Bottle Lantern.

# Ice Staff

![Ice Staff](Ice Staff Dropped.png)

- Wanda: "It'll freeze anything in its tracks."

## Description

The Ice Staff can freeze enemies in their tracks. When used, it temporarily freezes a mob usually within 1-4 blasts. Each use costs 5% durability, equating to 20 uses. Each time an Ice Staff is used, the character's Sanity is decreased by 1. Creatures that periodically drop things will still leave them behind while frozen.

Certain creatures are immune to the Ice Staff's freezing effect, including Lureplants, Eyeplants, Rock Lobsters, Depths Worms, Chester, Baby Beefalo, Blue Hounds, Ghosts, and Shadow Creatures.

Occasionally, an Ice Staff can be found surrounded by sleeping Blue Hounds: this is a Set Piece trap. When the Staff is taken, the player will lose 33 Sanity, it will rain, and all the Hounds will wake up and attack.

The Ice Staff can be used to extinguish smoldering or burning objects. Select freezable mobs (mostly bosses) have the diminishing returns trait, requiring more and more hits with the ice staff to freeze, up to a maximum of 2.5 times its natural resistance.

## Freezing Effect

Mobs have varying resistance to the Ice Staff's freezing effect and may require several charges in order to be frozen. See the table below for details:

| Blasts | Mobs |
|--------|------|
| 1      | Bee, Birchnutter, Butterfly, Catcoon, Crabbit, Crow, Redbird, Snowbird, Canary, Doydoy, Flup, Frog, Grass Gekko, Moleworm, Mosquito, No-Eyed Deer, Red Gem Deer, Parrot, Parrot Pirate, Seagull, Toucan, Poison Mosquito, Rabbit, Beardling, Smallbird, Wobster |

# Telelocator Focus

The **Telelocator Focus** is a craftable **Structure** found in the **Magic Tab** and used to control the randomness of the **Telelocator Staff**. It requires a **Shadow Manipulator** to prototype, and costs 4 **Nightmare Fuel**, 4 **Living Log**s, and 8 **Gold Nugget**s to craft.

## Quotes

- **wolfgang**: Pretty rock now hovers.
- **wendy**: The gem has focused it.
- **wx78**: POWER == ON
- **wickerbottom**: What a strange effect.
- **woodie**: Looks ready.
- **maxwell**: This one's ready.
- **wagstaff**: Contains a precisely placed gem of a particular pigment.

- **wanda**: This thing sure takes up a lot of space.
- **choose**: winona
- **source**: when examining a filled Gem Stand.

## Tips
- Enemies that are transported can be set on fire from the lightning strike and will quickly spread the fire anywhere they go. Creating walls around the Telelocator Focus will prevent this from happening, but placing a **Lightning Rod** near the Telelocator Focus will make this a non-issue altogether.¬†
- Deerclops will likely destroy the Telelocator Focus after being teleported.
- If the player is standing in the center of a Telelocator Focus and uses the Telelocator Staff on themselves, they will be teleported to the second-nearest Telelocator Focus instead.
- In the **Hamlet** DLC, a Telelocator Staff and Telelocator Focus are useful for gathering the Iron Hulk's parts in one place, at the cost of gems and living logs. Putting them on the fourth island ensures that the parts will always respawn close together when the Hulk is killed.

## Trivia
- The Telelocator Focus was officially introduced in the **Hungry for your Hunger** update. It was previously implemented into the game without the sockets and with unlimited uses.
- The Telelocator Focus used to be a Gemology Tab item.

## Exclusivity
- Don't Starve

- Don't Starve Together

## Quotes
- Wilson: Iconic, isn't it?
- Willow: It's very pointy.
- Wolfgang: Pick!
- Wendy: So that I may penetrate the earth itself. That the earth itself might be penetrated. (DST)
- WX-78: MINING IMPLEMENT DETECTED
- Wickerbottom: A specialized axe for chipping away at rocks.
- Woodie: Almost an axe, but not quite.
- Maxwell: Everybody loves a little mining.
- Wagstaff: A useful tool for acquiring minerals.
- Wigfrid: I can use it t√∂ get preci√∂us spear and helm materials. A trusty t√∂√∂l f√∂r securing spear and helm materials. (DST)
- Webber: Rocks will be ours!
- Walani: My back hurts just looking at it.
- Warly: For those tough to crack nuts.
- Woodlegs: Let's get them treasures!
- Wilba: TIS AXE WITH POINTY PARTS.
- Wormwood: Pokey
- Wheeler: Swell. Now I have no excuse not to do back-breaking mining work.
- Winona: Not my preferred kind of manual labor.
- Wortox: Heigh ho, heigh ho!
- Wurt: Rock cracker.

## Usage
To mine an object with the Pickaxe, right-click it from the inventory to equip it and left-click on the object. Once the character begins to mine, hold down the LMB or Spacebar to keep mining until the object breaks. Alternatively, one can mine faster by repeatedly clicking LMB with specific timing.

## Recipe
- **Item 1:** Pickaxe
- **Item 2:** Rocks (count 10)
- **Item 3:** Flint (count 3)
- **Result:** Heat Stone
- **Count:** 3
- **Tool:** Alchemy Engine

## Bugs
- There is a glitch where the Pickaxe (and other tools) can have 0% durability and remain equipped in the weapon slot instead of breaking. It disappears when the player opens and closes the map, unequips the tool, or quits and resumes the game. Trying to mine something with the bugged Pickaxe will often crash the game or will only cause the player to examine the rock.

## Trivia
- The Opulent Pickaxe was added in the October 2nd, 2012 update.
- When the Opulent Pickaxe is equipped, a 'ding' sound can be heard.

- **Winona**: That's some proper metalwork.
- **Wortox**: A place where little birds are penned.
- **Wurt**: Stick bird inside!
- **Walter**: Now we just need to catch a bird!
- **Wanda**: All it needs now is a little cuckoo bird.
- **Choose**: webber

The **Birdcage** is a craftable **Structure** that allows the domestication of **Birds** (Redbirds, Crows, Snowbirds, Canaries, Parrots, Pirate Parrots, Toucans, Kingfishers, Pigeons, etc.). It requires 6 **Gold Nuggets**, 2 **Papyrus**, and 2 **Seeds** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.

A **Birdcage** can only house one bird; however, it can be easily swapped with another at any time. As of yet, there is no functional difference between the four types of birds, other than the aesthetic appeal. Birds go to sleep at **night** and wake up in the morning or when offered an item. If offered an item, once the bird is done reacting to it (eating or refusing), it will go back to sleep. Additionally, the **Birdcage** accepts **Monster Meat** but doesn't accept **Cooked Eggs**.

## Usage
Feeding a bird in a **Birdcage** a raw **Fruit** or **Vegetable** (except Berries, Mushrooms, Lichen, Cave Banana, Banana, Seaweed, Cactus, and Mandrake) will make it drop 1‚Äì2 **Crop Seeds** of the same type, as well as having a 50% chance to drop an additional regular Seed. These specialized seeds can be planted on a **Farm** plot, enabling selective crops. The player can also feed the bird regular Seeds to get fresh Seeds in return.

If fed any kind of **Meats** (excluding eggs and raw monster meat) or **meat-based food** in any state of spoilage, the bird will produce a fresh **Egg**.

Birds imprisoned in a **Birdcage** will perish in 20 days if not fed. This timer is affected by the current **season**, speeding up and slowing down respectively. If the bird dies it will drop a fresh **Morsel**, which will then turn into rot as usual. Birds that die within the **Birdcage** will never drop a feather.

## Tips
- Spoiling Meats can be saved from turning into **Rot** or **Rotten Egg**s by converting them into fresh Eggs.
- The bird can be used to convert meats that are not accepted by

# Mussel Stick

**Exclusivity:** Shipwrecked

**Item Infobox:**
- **Ingredient 1:** Bamboo (x2)
- **Ingredient 2:** Vine (x1)
- **Ingredient 3:** Seaweed (x1)
- **Durability:** 1 use
- **Tab:** Food
- **Tier:** 1
- **Stack:** 20
- **Perk:** Attracts Mussels for harvest.
- **Spawn Code:** mussel_stick
- **Description:** Mussels stick to it!

**Quotes:**
- Wilson: I'm really going to stick it to those mussels.
- Willow: The mussels like this stick for some reason.
- Wolfgang: Mussels love little stick.
- Wendy: The mussels cling to this stick. Fools.
- WX-78: PROTEIN ATTRACTION AND GROWTH SYSTEM
- Wickerbottom: To harvest mollusks.
- Woodie: The mussels can't get enough of this thing.
- Maxwell: The mussels won't be able to resist.
- Wagstaff: An ingenious invention fabricated from readily available materials.
- Wigfrid: The foolish mussels shall climb this stick.
- Webber: The mussels do pull-ups on this.
- Walani: They glop to it.
- Warly: Mussels aren't strong enough to resist this stick!
- Woodlegs: For luring mussels into me belly.
- Wilba: INSHELL'D MEAT O' THE STICK
- Wormwood: Stick is swimming!
- Wheeler: Huh. I don't know what those sea creatures see in this stick.
- Choose: Webber

The **Mussel Stick** is a **Food Tab** item used solely for harvesting **Mussels** from **Mussel Beds**. It can be created from 2 **Bamboo**, 1 **Vine**, and 1 **Seaweed** at the **Science Machine**.

The stick can be planted on a Mussel Bed. Later the Mussels can be harvested, consuming the stick, the Mussel Bed, and giving 1, 3, or 6 Mussels (depending on how long ago the stick has been planted). The number of Mussels is indicated by how much of the stick is covered in them. New Mussel Beds will spawn randomly to replace those consumed, additionally they can also be crafted and planted by the player.

### Tips
- Mussels attached to the Mussel Stick do not spoil, making it an excellent tool for creating an emergency food supply. Given enough time has passed after planting, each planted stick will yield 6 mussels.
- Just two of these around the player base with a Crock Pot means an emergency supply of 4 Fishsticks by just adding 1 Twigs in each recipe, or 4 Seafood Gumbo if one Jellyfish is added to each recipe.
- Strong Winds during Hurricane Season can uproot planted mussel sticks, causing all materials to sink into the Ocean. These can be retrieved by sailing over them with a Trawl Net, if done so within 2 days.

# Pillow Fight Pit
The **Pillow Fight Pit** is an arena where Cozy Bunnyman can be summoned to fight with pads. In order to fight in the arena, players need to approach one or more of the Cozy Bunnyman in the evening or at night and give them the **Glove of Challenge**. Then go to the Pillow Fight Pit and click on the bell, then the battle will begin. You only need to use Pillow Armor and Pillow in combat. Your task is to throw Cozy Bunnyman out of the arena by pushing his pillow. If you push all the Bunnymans out of the arena, then they will return to their original positions and one of them will give you a **Red Pouch**. If one of the rabbits pushed you out of the arena, then you will lose and get nothing, and the Bunnymans will return to their places. If you ring the bell during the day, then all Cozy Bunnymans will wake up. They can also be driven away by taking the spinning carrots. They can't be challenged to a duel if they're spinning carrots. If you fight in the arena for more than one minute, then you will be given Lucky Gold Nuggets only for those hares that you managed to defeat.

# Nightmare Amulet

The Nightmare Amulet is a craftable **Item** found in the **Magic Filter**. It costs 6 **Gold Nuggets**, 4 **Nightmare Fuel**, and 2 **Purple Gems** to craft and requires a **Shadow Manipulator** to prototype. It can also be dropped by an **Ancient Pseudoscience Station** when it is damaged with a **Hammer**, **Gunpowder**, etc. It can be equipped in the chest slot and lasts for 3 minutes and 12 seconds (2/5th of an in-game day).

## Description
While equipped, the Nightmare Amulet allows the player to experience the effects of 0 **Sanity** without actually setting the character's Sanity to 0. The screen will become distorted with the usual low Sanity effects, and **Shadow Creatures** will spawn. While under effects of the Nightmare Amulet, more Shadow Creatures will spawn and more frequently, compared to the player being insane without the amulet. During this time, the player's Sanity will start dropping by 3.33 **sanity** per minute.

## Tips
- This item can be useful for collecting items that are only available at low Sanity levels, such as **Beard Hair** and **Nightmare Fuel**, while still being able to opt out of the dangers of insanity at will.
- This item can be especially useful when playing as **Maxwell**, since not only does his Sanity regeneration make it hard to go insane the normal way, but it also mitigates the Sanity loss caused by the Amulet.
- Using the Nightmare Amulet to its full potential to farm Nightmare Fuel can yield around 20-24 Nightmare Fuel.
- The Nightmare Amulet will almost always spawn a Shadow Creature upon equipping it. Paired with a low Sanity level, this can be utilized to spawn Shadow Creatures, and unequipping the amulet will not despawn them. This can be used to obtain more Nightmare Fuel.
- The Nightmare amulet can be used to lower your lunacy on the lunar island.

## Trivia
- The Nightmare Amulet shares the same in-game model with **Magiluminescence**, but its gem is purple instead of yellow.
- Prior to the **The Stuff Of Nightmares** update, the Nightmare Amulet actually restored 2 Sanity per minute, instead of reducing it.
- This item was previously crafted from the **Gemology** Tab before the latter was removed from the game.
- The gem in the Nightmare Amulet has eight corners, however the Purple Gems used to craft it only have six.
- According to **Wickerbottom** and **Maxwell**, the Nightmare Amulet communicates with the shadows.
- Eating a **Grim Galette** while wearing a Nightmare Amulet will instantly kill the player due to its effects.

## Construction & Function
The Celestial Portal is constructed by using the Portal Paraphernalia on the Florid Postern, and adding a Purple Moonlens and twenty Moon Rocks to it. Items can be added incrementally, and adding more than what is required will cause the excess to fall to the ground. Items committed cannot be removed.

When offered a Moon Rock Idol, the Celestial Portal will send the player back to the Character selection screen. When leaving the world, all items in the player's Inventory will be dropped automatically. Upon choosing a new character, the player will be transported back to the same world, keeping their Day count and Map exploration progress, along with any prototyped Crafting recipes and any adopted Critters.

Additionally, the Celestial Portal serves the same functions as the Florid Postern. It still marks the server's spawn point, and, if the server is set to Endless Mode, it can be used by Ghost Characters to resurrect at a cost of 25% of their maximum Health (this penalty can be reversed by using Booster Shots).

Using the Celestial Portal to switch character resets Touch Stone usage.

The Celestial Portal gives off a small amount of light at night, but is not an appropriate light source to ward off Charlie.

## Tips
- Players should not build a Celestial Portal in the Caves since it does not work as it should down there.

## Trivia
- When it was first introduced in the Celestial Update, changing characters at the Portal used to reset the player's map, day count, and crafting recipes. This is no longer the case as of update 288118.
- Since Wickerbottom is able to craft Science Items with a lower tier Crafting Station than other Characters from the start, she never properly "learns" those recipes, thus even if the player had crafted any of those recipes, it would appear "locked" when changing from Wickerbottom to another character.
- If Woodie offers a Moon Rock Idol to the Portal, Lucy the Axe will turn into a regular Axe when returning as a different character.
- The 'eye' of the portal resembles the awakened Alter.
- Each character has a unique quote before the game returns to the character selection screen.

# Bramble Husk

## Overview
- **Image**: ![Bramble Husk Dropped](Bramble Husk Dropped.png) ![Bramble Husk Equipped](Bramble Husk Equipped.png)
- **Name**: Bramble Husk
- **Damage**: 
- **Durability**: 450 hp
- **Perk**: Prevents damage from Brambles, Bramble Blooms, Bramble Traps, and cactus. Picking these things does not wear out the husk. Deals 22.6 average damage to every mob around wearer when hit.
- **Ingredients**:
  - Living Log: 2
  - Bone Shards: 4 (Wormwood Portrait only)
- **Tab**: Green Thumb
- **Tier**: 0
- **Description**: Nature's way of saying 'keep away'.

## Exclusivity
- **Don't Starve Together**: Hamlet

## Quotes
- Wilson: The best offense is a good defense.
- Willow: I think Wormwood made it.
- Wolfgang: Mighty Wolfgang does not need armor!
- Wendy: So my outside matches my inside.
- WX78: HE MADE IT WITH HIS POOP HANDS
- Wickerbottom: I believe our friend knit it himself.
- Woodie: All natural safety precautions.
- Maxwell: Who's frail now?
- Wigfrid: My ally is surely a str√∂ng warri√∂r.

- Useful in tandem with the Bramble Trap, as using it will let the player avoid their splash damage altogether.
- Not prevent an Elephant Cactus from damaging the player.
- Works well against swarming monsters like Spiders, Baby Tentacles, Frogs, and Bees.

## Trivia
- The only armor that has more durability in Don't Starve Together than in Don't Starve.

## Description
The **Produce Scale** is a structure exclusive to "Don't Starve Together" and introduced in "Return of Them". It is crafted at an Alchemy Engine with four Boards and four Cut Grass. Players can submit a Vegetable to the Produce Scale to display its Weight. All vegetables can be placed, but only Giant Vegetables have a weight. If the new vegetable is heavier than the current vegetable, the new vegetable takes its place and the old one is dropped next to the Produce Scale. Examining the Produce Scale also tells the day of the vegetable's harvest. Vegetables placed on the Produce Scale have their rot timer paused. Vegetables preserved with Beeswax cannot be placed on the Produce Scale.

In addition to this, if the player sets their own personal record by a giant vegetable on the scale, it will show it in the Compendium in the form of a photograph. It will show the player's character posing beside it wearing whatever skin they were wearing at the time of harvest.

## Trivia
The Produce Scale was introduced in the "Reap What You Sow" update.

## Description
The Mini Sign is a craftable item located in the Structures tab. 1 Board is used to craft 4 Mini Signs, requiring a Science Machine to prototype. By placing an item near a Mini Sign, the player can draw that item on it once by using a Feather Pencil.

Unlike other structures, Mini Signs cannot be destroyed with a Hammer to return their crafting resources, but can be dug up with any kind of Shovel. Digging them up will not remove images that have already been drawn on them.

## Tips
- Mini Signs can be used to sort Chests or other containers in the players' base, as they can be placed very close to them.

## Trivia
- Mini Signs were introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Herd Mentality update during A New Reign. They were later added to Don't Starve in the Quality of Life update.

## Usage
The Potter's Wheel is a [[:Category:Crafting Stations|Crafting Station]] in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'', introduced in ''[[A New Reign]]''. It requires 2 [[Cut Stone]], 2 [[Boards]] and 4 [[Twigs]] to build, and a [[Science Machine]] to prototype. It allows players to access the [[Sculptures Filter]] and build 26 different sculptures, mostly based on [[Chess Pieces]] and [[Giants]]. 3 of these sculptures are only available to craft during their associated seasonal [[:Category:Events|Event]].

The Bubble Pipe Carving and Carved Hornucopia sculptures are available near any Potter's Wheel, while the others must be unlocked by giving the Potter's Wheel the respective [[Sketch]]es, which will be returned if the Wheel is hammered.

After being placed, a Potter's Wheel requires [[Marble]], [[Cut Stone]], or a [[Moon Shard]] to be placed on top it to work. After the chosen material is placed, the player can turn it into the chosen sculpture with 2 [[Rocks]]. Based on the material used, the sculpture will be white if Marble was used, black if Cut Stone was used, and a translucent green if a Moon Shard was used. After the sculpture is made, players can pick it up and carry it similar to [[Suspicious Marble]].

## Trivia
- The Potter's Wheel was introduced in the ''[[A_New_Reign#October_13.2C_2016_-_Arts_and_Crafts|Arts and Crafts]]'' update.

# Rabbit Hole

![Rabbit Hole](Rabbit Hole.png) ![Collapsed Rabbit Hole](Rabbit Hole Collapsed.png)

**Spawns:** Rabbit, Winter Rabbit, Beardling  
**Biome:** Savanna, Grasslands  
**Spawn Code:** "rabbithole"  
**Renew:** No  
**Tool:** Can be Dug with Shovel

## Quotes
- Wolfgang: "You can not hide forever, jumping meat!"

- Willow: "Stupid rabbits. Come out so I can eat you."
- Woodie: "I doubt there are trees down there."

- Wortox: "Hopping wonders live within."
- Wurt: "Rabbit house."
- Walter: "We found its den!"
- Wanda: "I'd better watch my step, wouldn't want to fall down a rabbit hole."
- Choose: Wilson

## Description
Rabbit Holes are the home and spawning place for Rabbits. They run back to their holes at dusk, or when they are frightened. When a Rabbit is captured or killed, another will eventually respawn from the hole. A Rabbit Hole can be dug up with a Shovel to force a Rabbit out; however, this will destroy the hole, preventing future Rabbits from spawning there. If a Rabbit is caught outside its hole after dark for any reason, it will fall asleep.

A Rabbit Hole will spawn a new rabbit every 2.5 days. Since a Morsel restores 12.5 hunger and the necessary calorie value per day is 75, this means that having access to 15 Rabbit Holes would be enough to sustain oneself through winter (75/12.5)*2.5=15). It is also of note that a Rabbit that manages to flee into a Rabbit Hole after e.g a failed hunting attempt will not trigger the 2.5 days respawn timer. Instead, it will occupy the Rabbit Hole and leave it again (if the conditions are met) after a random amount of time between 1 and 3 real-time minutes.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, during Spring, Rabbit Holes will turn into Collapsed Rabbit Holes and won't spawn Rabbits anymore. A few days after Spring has ended, Collapsed Rabbit Holes will go back to normal and start spawning Rabbits again. A Collapsed Rabbit Hole can be dug up as well to force a Rabbit out, this will also destroy the hole forever.

## Tips
- Putting a Trap directly above a Rabbit Hole will ensure a captured Rabbit most of the time.
  - In the base game, multiple traps can be placed after the first trap has caught a Rabbit, to stockpile Rabbits. This is useful during Winter or when one wishes to farm Nightmare Fuel when the Rabbits have turned into Beardlings.

The Regular Jungle Tree is a variant of [Tree] found in Jungle Biomes in the *Don't Starve: Shipwrecked* DLC. Much like the Totally Normal Tree, it drops 2 Living Logs when cut, and the stump may be dug up with a Shovel to obtain another Living Log. Because it drops no seeds, it cannot be replanted. It is usually found along with some Evil Flowers encircling the tree.

## Mosquito Bugs

# Campfire

## Overview
The Campfire is a key to basic survival in the world. It provides Light, Heat, and allows Food to be cooked.

## Requirements
- 3 Cut Grass
- 2 Logs

## Characteristics
- Cheaper than a Fire Pit in terms of resources
- Less efficient, cannot be re-lit
- More susceptible to Rain
- Can set nearby flammable objects on fire

## Fuel and Duration
- Lasts 2 minutes and 15 seconds unless more fuel is added
- Maximum duration of 4.5 minutes with additional fuel

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Sure beats darkness."
- Willow: "I like fire."
- Wolfgang: "Good bye dark times!"
- Wendy: "I might survive this night!"
- WX78: "A TEMPORARY ENCAMPMENT"

## Usage
Generally, campfires are built when lacking resources to make a Fire Pit or when camping in a location that is not meant to be permanent.

## Fire Pit

## Overview
The Fire Pit is the center of most base camps. It provides light and heat, allows food to be cooked, and is a contained, safer fire than a Campfire.

## Requirements
- 2 Logs
- 12 Rocks

## Characteristics
- A persistent structure, unlike Campfires
- Can be re-lit by putting fuel in it
- More efficient, fuel lasts 2 times longer
- Less susceptible to Rain

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Sure beats darkness."
- Willow: "I could watch it for hours."
- Wolfgang: "Good bye dark times!"
- Wendy: "A flame to keep the horrors at bay."
- Wickerbottom: "A fire pit."

## Usage
Fire Pits provide a great deal of light and heat to the surrounding area. Once placed, they cannot be moved unless destroyed by a Hammer or Deconstruction Staff.

## Fuel and Duration
- Lasts 3 minutes unless more fuel is added
- Maximum duration of 6 minutes with additional fuel

## Trivia
- The flame sprite is reused in "The Screecher."
- Before Ash was added to the game, the fire pit was left as a pile of burnt logs before disappearing about a minute later.

## Skins
In "Don't Starve Together," skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the Belongings page.

## Tips
- Since unwrapping a Bundled Supplies returns the Wax Paper used to craft Bundling Wrap, the only net loss per use is 1 Rope.
- Each held Bundling Wrap can be used to gain three extra inventory slots, useful when collecting a lot of resources and transporting said resources from one place to another.
- A common use for Bundling Wraps is for storing Light Bulbs, as they no longer spoil quickly while bundled.

## Trivia
- Bundling Wraps and Bundled Supplies were first introduced to "Don't Starve Together" in the "Herd Mentality" update during "A New Reign." They were later added to "Don't Starve" in the "Quality of Life" update.
- According to Wickerbottom, Bund

## Description
Mini Glaciers are naturally occurring objects found in the **Reign of Giants** DLC. When mined, they will drop **Ice** and **Rocks**. Mini Glaciers are only at their fullest during the **Winter** and will begin to melt in the **Spring**. By **Summer**, all that will be left is a puddle of water, and the player will have to wait until **Autumn** for them to slowly begin to freeze again. If exposed to a heat source (such as a **Campfire**) Mini glaciers will melt, reducing down to the puddle state. Once the heat source is gone, and if the ambient temperature is low enough, the Mini Glacier will freeze again. It will return to the maximum state allowed by the current temperature. When mined, Mini Glaciers make a different sound from boulders.

Additionally, Mini Glaciers will appear next to **Pengull** breeding grounds during **Winter**, making them a renewable resource.

# Life Jacket

- **Description:** Safety first!

## Ingredients

- **Vine:** 2
- **Empty Bottle:** 3

## Quotes
- Wolfgang: Big seawater will not take Wolfgang now!
- Wilson: Keeps me afloat, without my boat!
- Willow: But will it keep my lighter dry?
- Woodie: A lil reassurance.

# Kitcoon

Don't Starve Together's Kitcoons are a mob based on Catcoons. The name is a portmanteau of Kitty and Catcoon, with Catcoon itself being a blend of Cat and Racoon.

## Description
Kitcoons initially hide behind various objects in biomes corresponding to their type. They can be discovered by their tail wagging behind the object they are hiding under. Entities with Kitcoons hiding will have an "investigate" command when hovered over. Interacting with the object will reveal the Kitcoon.

## Behavior
Kitcoons trail behind a specific player, acting as invincible companions. Unlike other critters, there is no limit to how many Kitcoons can follow a player. Initially, Kitcoons follow the player who found them but will stop if the player dies, leaves the server, or enters the caves. Any neutral Kitcoon will remain where they were abandoned and can be bound to another player that pets them. Players can adopt any of the 9 Kitcoons by petting them and can unbind the Kitcoons following them by right-clicking to abandon them.

## Finding Kitcoons
Kitcoons are hidden across different biomes. They can be found in Grasslands, Savanna, Deciduous Forest, Desert, Forest, Marsh, Mosaic, and on the Lunar Island. They hide behind objects such as trees, saplings, rocks, etc., with their tails sticking out from behind.

The easiest way to locate Kitcoons is to summon and follow a Ticoon. Ticoons can be summoned from an active Catcoon Shrine for 1 Lucky Gold Nugget. Players may befriend regular catcoons by visiting a Deciduous Forest biome, who puke a sack of single gold nugget.

## Kitcoon Nursery
The Kitcoon Nursery is where Kitcoons can be returned after being found. When standing near the Nursery, a "Send Home" option will appear while hovering the mouse over any Kitcoons that currently following the player. Sending a Kitcoon home will cause them to be attached to that Nursery, and they will stay wandering within a certain short range of that Nursery.

Players can click the Kitcoon Nursery to play Hide and Seek mini-game with Kitcoons.

### Hide and Seek
When there are 3 or more Kitcoons stayed around a Nursery, the player can click on the Nursery to start the game Hide and Seek. Each Nursery can play one game per day.

To play the game, within 1 to 7.5 tiles radius, there must be hiding places for 5 times the number of Kitcoons in the Nursery. The player has to find all the Kitcoons before time runs out. When time is over, they will be rewarded with Red Pouches based on how many Kitcoons they found. Finding all 9 Kitcoons will drop a Large Red Pouch.

### When Event is Over
When not in Year of the Catcoon, the drops will be as following:

| Chance | Drops |
|--------|-------|
| 13.5%  | Flint, Cut Grass, Twigs, Petals |
| 4.1%  | Birchnut, Pine Cone, Twiggy Tree Cone, Rocks, Dark Petals, Spoiled Fish Morsel, Crimson Feather, Jet Feather, Saffron Feather |
| 2.7%  | Frayed Yarn |
| 1.4%  | Needlenosed Squirt, Smolt Fry, Gord's Knot, Frazzled Wires, Lucky Cat Jar |

# Obelisks

![Obelisk](Obelisk.png)

Obelisks are indestructible **Structures** usually found surrounding the **Pig King** in **Survival Mode**, but also act as an indicator of the **Sanity** level of a player. When the Sanity level is 15% and below, the Obelisks around the Pig King change their states: the lowered ones raise, and the raised ones become lowered. The **Shadow Creature** **Shadow Creature#Mr. Skitts|Mr. Skitts** briefly appears to raise and lower the Obelisks.

In **Adventure Mode**, Obelisks act as road barriers and can be great for many defensive ideas. However, it will be hard to deal with, as one might have to eat a load of raw **Green Mushroom|Green Caps** to lower their Sanity and **Cap/Green|Cooked Green Caps** to raise their Sanity, and it would take a while to defend against something, like **Hounds**.

## Quotes

### Raised Sanity Obelisk
- **Wilson**: That's a CRAZY looking rock!

### Raised Insanity Obelisk
- **Wilson**: TAKE THAT, SANE SELF!

## Usage

Obelisks may be found in one of two states, depending on the Sanity level of the player: **raised** and **lowered**. Obelisks in the **lowered** state will not act as obstacles in the player's path. Obelisks in the **raised** state will act as obstacles and the player will need to adjust their Sanity level accordingly in order to lower them again. The player cannot use the **Nightmare Amulet**'s insanity effect to raise or lower the Obelisk.

In **Adventure Mode**, the player may encounter Obelisks that will impede their progress if their Sanity is not in the correct range. In **Sandbox Mode**, they serve as a decoration, which surrounds the Pig King.

## Trivia

- Obelisks were added in **A Little Rain Must Fall** update.
- Sometimes a **Grass Tuft** will spawn on an Obelisk, making it impossible to harvest.
- The image in the fourth **William Carter Puzzles** includes what looks like a drawing of blueprints for an Obelisk.

## Description

Hounds are monsters that attack periodically in packs. They attack every 3-13 days and can also spawn from Hound Mounds. At least two Hounds will typically appear during an attack, which is signaled by growling noises heard for a short time. The player will also comment on the growling three times until it stops, and the Hounds attack. More Hounds will spawn at a time as the game progresses.

Hounds take two blasts from an Ice Staff to be frozen. When killed, they drop one Monster Meat and have a chance of dropping a Hound's Tooth.

In the Reign of Giants (ROG) DLC, if a player tracks a Varg, the Varg can spot the player and howl, calling two Hounds to help attack the player. Depending on the season, these Hounds can be normal, Blue, and Red.

In the Shipwrecked (SW) DLC, the Slot Machine has a chance to spawn two normal Hounds. Hounds in periodic attacks are replaced by Crocodogs.

In the Hamlet (HAM) DLC, Hounds in periodic attacks are replaced by Vampire Bats.

## Periodic Hound Attacks

When a Hound attack is imminent, snorting and growling sounds will be heard. These sounds start off softly and grow louder as the Hounds approach. Characters will also call attention to these sounds with phrases such as, "Did you hear that?". Usually, these warnings appear at least twice before the Hounds come. When the Hounds appear, the growling sounds will be replaced with the very real running and panting sounds that Hounds make when they attack. Any spawning hounds appear within a 30 unit or 7¬Ω pitchfork tile radius of the player.

## Behavior

Hounds are naturally aggressive, but easily distracted as they will attack all creatures on sight. Hounds will immediately charge the player when they spawn during a Hound attack. After a while, they can become distracted by nearby Mobs or Meat.

## Fighting Strategy

Hounds are much faster than the player and cannot be outrun unless they become distracted or belong to a Hound Mound. The player can use a Walking Cane or run along a Road to outrun them.

## Tips

- While Hounds are attacking, Chester can and will be targeted.
- 2 or 3 Hounds can usually be defeated, without issue, by using a Spear, Log Suit, and Football Helmet.
- Red Hound is the most volatile as it will burn anything around it upon its death by setting flames on the floor which could lead to serious loss of flammable Structures and Items. It is advised to fight them in an isolated area from the flammable Structures and Items. They can also be killed near an active Ice Flingomatic to avoid the fires.
- Hounds are easily distracted. As such, many strategies involve leading Hounds to other Mobs.

## Trivia

- Hounds and Red Hounds were added in "The Birds and the Bees & Dogs

## Usage

The **Compass** tells the orientation of the player when the player is not using minimap. When examined, the player will state what direction they're facing (the camera is rotated with the E and Q buttons). The player will start out oriented Northeast.

This item is useless to **Wes** and **Wilbur**, since they cannot talk and thus cannot interact with the item.
