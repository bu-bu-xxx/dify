# Moose/Goose Egg

## Description

The Moose/Goose Egg is an object in the Reign of Giants DLC. During Spring, Moose/Goose will wander off to lay an egg. The egg radiates electricity and can be struck with a Hammer 4 times to cause it to hatch; otherwise, if the Moose/Goose is left alone, it will hatch on its own. Each strike with the Hammer deals 10 damage to the player. A Weather Pain can be used to hatch the egg from a distance without taking damage. 5 Moslings will hatch from the egg and attack if the player gets too close.

Once the Egg hatches, the small nest will remain behind, giving Moose/Goose the possibility to lay another Egg. At the end of Spring, both the egg and the nest will despawn.

## Trivia

- The egg will randomly alternate between being called a "Moose Egg" and a "Goose Egg".

## Bugs

- Occasionally, the Moose/Goose will spawn, and no egg will spawn, even if left alone for days.
- Spawning in this item spawns an empty nest. To fix this, you need to add the 'InitEgg()' variable to the end. Eg: 'c_spawn("mooseegg"):InitEgg()'
- Occasionally a Moose/Goose egg that did not hatch while the Moose/Goose was still alive will remain in place, unhatched through all the seasons. Using wormholes, moving many screens away or relogging will not cause the egg to hatch or despawn.
- Dying by hammering the egg will result in the morgue listing the death as "Shenanigans".

# Maxwell's Light

![Maxwell's Light](File:Maxwell's Light.png)

Maxwell's Light is a special **Structure** that appears in Chapters 5 and 6 of **Adventure Mode**. It will light up when approached, and will turn off when the player walks away from it.

## Properties
- **Renew**: Cannot be destroyed
- **Spawn Code**: `maxwelllight`, `maxwelllight_area`

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: I wonder how they work.
- **Willow**: These are no fun. They light themselves.
- **Wolfgang**: Scary light!
- **Wendy**: What a curious light.
- **WX-78**: THEY SENSE MY PRESENCE.
- **Wickerbottom**: How magical!
- **Woodie**: That's unnatural.
- **Maxwell**: Aw, it remembers me.
- **Wagstaff**: A light source that sensitive to motion! Revolutionary!
- **Wigfrid**: Dark magic lives here.
- **Webber**: Well, these would've been handy before.
- **Walani**: Weird.
- **Warly**: A light is always welcome.
- **Woodlegs**: 'Tis a dark flame.
- **Wilba**: HOW LIKE A SPOOKY LIGHT
- **Wormwood**: Bright rock
- **Wheeler**: Whoever put this here is my new best friend.
- **Winona**: How does that even work?
- **Wortox**: Ooohoohoo, it warms in my presence!
- **Wurt**: Don't like it...
- **Walter**: That's a pretty neat trick.

Maxwell's Light cannot be destroyed and does not drain sanity when standing next to it. It's possible to light a Maxwell's Light with a **Torch** or **Fire Staff**. Standing among the eyes in the shadows around Maxwell's Lights will not cause them to disappear.

## Trivia
- Before **The End of the Beginning** update, Maxwell's Light used the same model as **Night Lights**.
- Some of the Maxwell's Lights in Chapter 6 have a much smaller light radius than those in Chapter 5.
- Maxwell's Lights make an appearance in Klei Entertainment's **Don't Starve Together** promo, **A New Reign**.

## Bugs
- If the player sleeps near a Maxwell's Light, it will not light up upon waking up until they move out of the Light's radius. This also applies when **Woodie** awakens from **Werebeaver** form or when resurrecting via **Touch Stone**.

## Scrapbook_Info

Frequently, hits on this crown will cause it to create an impenetrable barrier for a short time.

## Details

The Thulecite Crown is a craftable item found in the Ancient Pseudoscience Filter. It requires 4 Nightmare Fuel, 4 Thulecite, and an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. It also has a 33% chance to be found inside a Large Ornate Chest. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Thulecite Crowns cannot be prototyped and can only be crafted when near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

The Thulecite Crown is head armor that will absorb 90% of physical damage and has 1200 durability. When the wearer takes damage from an attack, it has a 33% chance to create a force field. The force field lasts for 4 seconds, preventing all damage from attacks (except for Fire) and granting stun immunity. While the force field is active, 5% of incoming damage is reduced from Sanity. The force field cannot occur more than once every 9 seconds. Unequipping the Crown will disable an active force field, even though the animation remains. The Crown's force field emits enough light to protect the player from Charlie.

Thulecite is renewable by killing the Ancient Fuelweaver to reset the Ruins and by feeding Ambrosia to Dust Moths. Therefore, an unlimited amount of Thulecite Crowns can be crafted.

## Tips

- The Thulecite Crown is more suited for tanking enemies instead of kiting them.
- The Crown is really useful when facing big groups of Mobs like Spiders, Hounds, and Birchnutters, as the force field will protect the players from being stunlocked.
- The force field will protect from the special effects of enemy attacks, such as those of Frogs.
- The Crown is a great armor for Willow, Maxwell, and Wigfrid since these characters can regain their sanity easily.
- It is generally advised to also wear disposable body armor to increase the life of the Thulecite Crown. In Don't Starve

# Gigantic Beehive

## Object Infobox
- **Image**: ![Gigantic Beehive](Gigantic_Beehive.png)
- **Resources**: 
  - Honey: 49%
  - Honeycomb: 1% (when hit with a Hammer)
- **Spawns**: Bee Queen
- **Biome**: Grasslands
- **Spawn Code**: "beequeenhivegrown"

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: How in science did it get so big?!
- **Willow**: Dare you guys to smack it with a hammer.
- **Wolfgang**: Wolfgang's mighty punches do nothing.
- **Wendy**: Dripping with enmity. And honey.
- **WX-78**: PROOF OF BEES' INDUSTRIOUSNESS
- **Wickerbottom**: An Apis mellifera nest of unusual size.
- **Woodie**: Nature is something else, eh?
- **Maxwell**: I don't see what all the buzz is about.
- **Wigfrid**: A hive of winged warriors.
- **Webber**: Oh, bother!
- **Winona**: Yeesh! I'd take a hammer to that.
- **Warly**: That's almost definitely bigger than before.
- **Wortox**: The mystery grows!
- **Wormwood**: Big Buzz home!
- **Wurt**: Have bad feeling, Florp.
- **Walter**: Woah, it's huge!
- **Wanda**: This is giving me a bad feeling...
- **Choose**: Maxwell

The Gigantic Beehive is a naturally spawning object exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It can be found in the Grasslands along with other Beehives. It looks similar to a normal beehive, but much larger in size. The Bee Queen resides within, and hammering it repeatedly will spawn her.

A stream of Honey flows out of the hole near the top, and hammering the Gigantic Beehive will reduce the size of the stream. Every 120 seconds, the honey stream will grow, and can be hammered again to receive more Honey. The Gigantic Beehive has 4 stages of honey growth, each signified by how much honey is dripping out of it.

Each hammering has a 49% chance of dropping 1 Honey and a 1% chance of dropping 1 Honeycomb onto the ground, which can be picked up. Honey can be repeatedly harvested until the stream is gone, without spawning the Bee Queen; however, there is a chance that hammering it to Stage 1 (a tiny bit of honey showing) will still spawn the Bee Queen, and hammering it at Stage 1 will always cause her to awaken. As a result, care is to be taken, as there is always a risk of the Bee Queen being summoned if one wants to maximize honey collection.

When destroyed, the Gigantic Beehive will become a Honey Patch, which cannot be walked on. It will regenerate in 20 days, which also makes Honeycomb renewable. As it is growing, the Gigantic Beehive will have two extra growth stages, each called the Somewhat Gigantic Beehive. Each character has a different quote for a Somewhat Gigantic Beehive.

## Tips
- As Bee Boxes do not produce Honey during Winter, the Gigantic Beehive is the only renewable source of Honey during said season.
- In general, a base can be made a few screens away from the Gigantic Beehive, as the free Honey is relatively riskless to obtain; even if the Bee Queen is summoned, the player can simply run away till the Bee Queen loses interest and replants herself.

## Trivia
- The Gigantic Beehive was added in the **Cute Fuzzy Animals** update.

- **Skill Owner**: Wurt
- **Ingredients**:
  - Boards: 2

- Warly: "The fishmongers seem to be doing quite well for themselves."
- Wigfrid: "The armery of the fish beast warriors."
- Maxwell: "Apparently, I'm not invited. Oh how shall I ever go on."
- Webber: "They don't seem to like sharing their toys."
- Wendy: "Mermfolk Ownlee"... hmph. How childish.
- Wickerbottom: "Mermfolk Ownlee"? Hm. I see more spelling lessons are in order.
- Willow: "I can't look inside? But that just makes me want to even more!"
- Wilson: "It says 'Mermfolk Ownlee.'"
- Winona: "Get your merm hats here!"
- Wolfgang: "For fish man only."
- Woodie: "We're not welcome here, Luce."
- Wormwood: "Glub Glub only"
- Wortox: "A Merm millinery."

- WX78: "IT IS POORLY BUILT"

## Scrapbook Info
While stocked with Cut Grass and Logs, Guard Merm will grab a Swamp Brawler Helmet from it, reducing its stores. Swamp Brawler Helmets are a cheap way for a merm to get 50% protection from damage for a short while.

# Superior Armermry

## Description
For merms with discerning taste in combat headgear.

## Details
- **Filter**: Wurt Filter
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes (1)
- **Icon**: Superior Armermry.png
- **Skill Required**: Hardheaded II
- **Skill Owner**: Wurt
- **Ingredients**:
  - Boards: 4
  - Tentacle Spots: 1
  - Log: 5
  - Cut Grass: 5 (only in Wurt/DST)
- **Spawn Code**: "merm_armory_upgraded"

## Quotes
- (Same as Armermry)

## Scrapbook Info
While stocked with Cut Grass and Logs, Guard Merm will grab a Swamp Warrior Helmet from it, reducing its stores. Swamp Warrior Helmets are a better design over their Brawler cousin, providing 70% resistance from damage for a longer period of time.

# Tips
You can first build an Armermry or Superior Armermry with the necessary skills and then respawn your Wurt at the Celestial Portal with different selected skills. This will allow you to fill an Armermry with resources without the "Hardheaded I" or "Hardheaded II" skills.

Only one spawns per world, and it can be **Hammer**ed to yield one **Can of Silly String** and **Boards**. It always spawns next to a **Deflated Balloon**. The Wicker Basket has its own **Map** icon, allowing it to be easily found later. It is the only way to build the **Skyworthy** outside of a **Hamlet** world.

## Resources
- **Boards**
- **Can of Silly String**

## Tips
- The Wicker Basket has its own icon on the player's **Map**.
- The piece of Cloth can be used to craft a **Pith Hat** for **Humid Season** or a **Gas Mask** to explore the **Gas Rainforest**.

## Trivia
- The Deflated Balloon and Wicker Basket share their textures with the Deflated Balloon and Wicker Basket found in Hamlet-compatible worlds.
- The Crashed Balloon is functionally similar to the **Debris** from the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC.

# Ponds

Ponds are small bodies of water that usually spawn in **Grasslands**, **Forests**, **Marshes**, and **Ruins**.

There are three types of Ponds: purple, green, and blue. Purple Ponds appear in Marshes and spawn **Mosquitoes** at **dusk and night**. Green Ponds appear in Grasslands and Forests and spawn **Frogs** during the day. Blue Ponds are found in Ruins and contain **Eels** instead of **Fish**.

Using a **Fishing Rod**, **Fish** (in Common or Marsh Ponds) or **Eels** (in Cave Ponds) can be caught at any time of **day**. Fishing takes 4 seconds plus 4 seconds for each missing fish in the pond. All variations of Ponds contain up to 10 fishes/eels, and one fish/eel is regenerated every 160 seconds.

In **Don't Starve Together**, Ponds can be used to fill up **Mosquito Sacks** to make **Water Balloons** and to fill up **Watering Can** or **Waterfowl Can**.

After **Shadow Rifts** are enabled, Blue Ponds in the Caves form **Nitre Formations** during **Acid Rain**.

## Frozen Ponds

Ponds will freeze in winter once the temperature is low enough, and when frozen, they won't spawn creatures. They also cannot be fished, though they can be walked over. If you run on it, you might slip.

## Nitrified Pond

After **Acid Rain**, Cave Ponds will form **Nitre Formations**. It will also be possible to walk on it and you will not be able to fish.

## Plants

Ponds spawn with 2-4 **Plants** along their banks, which can be examined separately. They cannot be picked, but they can be set on **Fire** to yield **Ashes**. The plants will grow back every **Summer**. Ponds found in the Ruins are surrounded by **Cave Lichen** that resemble **Lichen** instead of the normal plants.

### Tips

- When fishing, one should be wary of Frogs and Mosquitoes, as they are aggressive.
- When fishing in a Marsh, it should be noted that the Marsh is also the native habitat of **Tentacles** and **Merm**s.
- One may fish in Frog Ponds unbothered at dusk when the Frogs return to the water, and in the spring and fall when it is warm enough to thaw the Pond but not warm enough for Frogs to spawn. One may fish in Mosquito Ponds unbothered during the day, since Mosquitoes only come out at dusk/night.
- Frog Ponds will sometimes show up in a small cluster. Pig houses can be built near/inside this cluster (preferably walled off) and the frogs will kill any pigs that spawn during the day but will not eat the meat. With this setup, Pig Skin and Meat can be collected regularly at dusk/night.

### Trivia

- Frog Ponds and Mosquito Ponds were added in the **"A Little Rain Must Fall"** update, while the ones found in the Ruins were added in the **"Stuff of Nightmares"** update.
- After burning the Plant or Algae, saving and reloading the game will cause them to reappear on the pond.

The **Year of the Varg** is an **event** in **Don't Starve Together**, lasting from February 9 until March 16, 2018. It is inspired by the Chinese Year of the Dog, which started from February 16, 2018, and continues until February 4, 2019. In the **Chinese zodiac**, each year is related to an animal in a 12-year cycle.

## Exclusive Features

## Trivia
- The **Verdant Skin Collection** was added alongside the event.
- The event was originally announced to end on March 1, 2018. However, on that day, the event was extended to March 16.
- During the time of the event, the theme in the main menu of the game is slightly different by being mixed with Chinese instruments.
- The Hound Figure's crafting description ("It ain't nothing but a clay hound dog.") is a reference to the Elvis Presley song **Hound Dog**.
- The two Vargling skins introduced with the Year of the Varg event (the Purebred and Pedigree Varglings) resemble two dog breeds believed to originate from China (the **Chow Chow** and **Shih Tzu**, respectively).
- According to **Rhymes with Play** #179, the reason that the new Clay Hounds and Vargs in the event are earthen-themed is because the developers discovered that the Chinese lunar year that the event was held in (2018) was associated with the element of earth.

## Scrapbook Info
- Raises sanity while cooling the wearer.

## Tips

- The Chilled Amulet requires more hits from mobs to freeze them than the Ice Staff needs.
- The Chilled Amulet provides no protection against any fire damage.
- Since the amulet can only be worn for 6 minutes, its best use is early in the game during the middle of summers.

## Trivia
- The Chilled Amulet shares the same in-game model with the Lazy Forager but its gem is blue instead of orange.

## Scrapbook Info
Contains map data of the survivor who created it. Used to share map information.

The Map Scroll is a craftable Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in A New Reign. It requires 1 Feather Pencil and 1 Papyrus to craft and is found in the Cartography Filter. This tab can only be accessed while standing next to a Cartographer's Desk, therefore the Map Scroll can not be prototyped.

Upon examination, the character will say who drew the Map Scroll and on which day. The Map Scroll contains the data of the preparing player's Map at the time of the scroll's creation. When used by another player, the knowledge in the scroll will be added to the user's Map. Therefore, players can organize map exploration and gain quicker access to full map knowledge.

If the Map Scroll is created on the surface, it will not transfer any Caves map data and vice versa. Map Scrolls must be in the Caves to transfer cave map data and on the surface to transfer surface map data.

## Trivia
- Map Scrolls were added in the A Little Fixer Upper update.

## Scrapbook Info
While stocked with twigs and rocks, regular Merm will grab a Shoddy Tool from it, reducing its stores. Shoddy tools will increase the amount of work a merm does for a short time. With a shoddy tool, follower Merm will help chop trees, mine rocks, dig in a garden, and till soil.

## Quotes
- Same as Shoddy Tool Shed

## Scrapbook Info
While stocked with twigs and rocks, regular Merm will grab a Slightly Less Shoddy Tool from it, reducing its stores. Slightly Less Shoddy tools increase the amount of work a merm does a little more than their lesser sibling, the Shoddy Tool. With a shoddy tool, follower Merm will help chop trees, mine rocks, dig in a garden, and till soil.

# Tips
You can first build a Shoddy Tool Shed or Slightly Less Shoddy Tool Shed with the necessary skills and then swap characters back to Wurt at the Celestial Portal, with a different skill tree. This will allow you to fill a Shoddy Tool Shed with resources without the "Industrious Merm I" or "Industrious Merm II" skills.

# Gramaphone (Phonograph)

## Overview
The **Gramaphone** (or **Phonograph**) is a **Structure** found in the Epilogue of **Adventure Mode**, located near **Maxwell**, who is in the **Nightmare Throne**. It cannot be destroyed and has no practical function in the game. When Maxwell is first reached, the Gramaphone plays the **Ragtime** theme used in some update trailers.

## Features
- **Image**: ![Gramophone Build](Gramophone Build.png)
- **Spawn Code**: `maxwellphonograph`
- **Renew**: Cannot be destroyed
- **Biome**: Chess

## Exclusivity
- **Don't Starve**

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "So that's where the music was coming from."
- **Willow**: "I like more exciting music."
- **Wolfgang**: "Is box that sings!"
- **Wendy**: "Shall we have a danse macabre?"
- **WX-78**: "IT IS A MUSICAL SLAVE."
- **Wickerbottom**: "It appears to have no power source."
- **Woodie**: "Better than most of the stuff on the radio."
- **Maxwell**: "That accursed thing!"
- **Wagstaff**: "Ah, the Gramophone ML-77. I know it well."
- **Wigfrid**: "A mechanical s√∂ngstress."
- **Webber**: "We could listen to that forever!"
- **Walani**: "Jaunty, but grating."
- **Warly**: "I wonder what is in his record collection?"
- **Woodlegs**: "A bewitched tune it plays."
- **Wilba**: "FOOD OF LOVE?"
- **Wormwood**: "Can't dance to it"
- **Wheeler**: "Is there some kind of dance party going on?"
- **Winona**: "I prefer blues."
- **Wortox**: "Ooo, music! I'm practically giddy!"
- **Wurt**: "Noisemaker..."
- **Walter**: "I wonder how an antique like this ended up here."
- **Wanda**: "Ah! Now there's a tune I'm familiar with."

## Behavior
- The Gramaphone can be turned off and back on. When turned off, Maxwell says, "Thank you. I have been listening to that song for an eternity." When turned back on, Maxwell says, "I guess I deserve that."
- Freeing Maxwell stops the Gramaphone from playing. Once the player character is in the throne, the Gramaphone plays again to taunt the player as it did to Maxwell.

## Trivia
- The Gramaphone music emanates from **Maxwell's Door** while the door is open.
- The game refers to this device as "Gram"a"phone", while its real-life counterpart is called "Gram"o"phone". Whether it's a mistake or purposeful is not known.
- If the player spawns the Gramaphone using the **Console** and is resurrected next to it, the Gramaphone will be playing.
- The **Chorusbox Circuit** plays a simpler, musicbox rendition of this song.
- In the game files, the song that the gramophone plays is called "d9ney."
- **Wagstaff** identifies the Gramaphone at the end of Adventure Mode as a Gramophone ML-77 in his examination quote for it.

- **Choose:** Wilba

## Description

The **Coral Nubbin** is a craftable Item introduced in the *Don't Starve: Shipwrecked* DLC. It is found in the *Refine Tab*, requires a *Science Machine* to prototype, and 3 *Limestone*s and a *Coral Larva* to craft. The Coral Nubbin will spoil after 20 days once crafted, but can be placed in an *Ice Box* to slow spoilage. It allows the player to plant a new *Coral Reef* at a chosen location in *Shallow Ocean*. Once planted, the Reef will first be in an empty state, but will slowly grow *Coral*s over time. After 12 *Days*, a Coral Reef is fully regrown.

## Tips

- As the Coral Nubbin spoils, but the Coral Larva does not, it may be better to refrain from crafting the Coral Nubbin until the player is ready to place it.

## Trivia

- Coral Nubbins were added to the *Shipwrecked* DLC more than a year after its official completion in the *Home Sea Home* update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.

## Phobic Experiment
The **Phobic Experiment** is a feature exclusive to the **Hallowed Nights** event in **Don't Starve Together**. It can be conducted at the **Mad Scientist Lab**, using **Frog Legs** and a **Gold Nugget**, and depleting 10 **Sanity** for the player. The experiment has a 66% chance to result in a **Brew of Phobic Abatement** and a 33% chance to result in a **Brew of Phobic Abrogation**.

Consuming the Brews protects the players from **Sanity** loss caused by totally normal bats spawned by chopping **Trees** or opening **Chests** for a limited period of time. The small Brew's effects last 4 minutes, while the large Brew's effects last 6 minutes. Both of them can also be used as **Fire** **Fuel**.

## Trivia
- The Mad Scientist Lab and all related craftable Items were introduced to the Hallowed Nights event in 2018.

# Cave Cleft

- **Wheeler**: Those bats are wasting their time in a cave when they should be outside flying.
- **Choose**: Wilba

The **Cave Cleft** is a naturally spawning **Structure** exclusive to **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC.

## Interior
Within, only a single room is able to be explored unlike **Ancient Pig Ruins** and **Mant Hill**s. The room is dark with the exception of some light near the exit during **Day** and **Dusk**.

Upon entering a **Cave Cleft**, the player will find some structures such as **Stalagmites** and **Unimportant Pillars** which can be mined with a **Pickaxe** or **Opulent Pickaxe**. One can also find some **Fern**, **Mushrooms** on the ground, and sometimes **Flint**. At the center of the room, a **Spooky Hole** will be found.

Only one **Cave Cleft** per world will lead to another area. After the player is flown to the **Pinacle** (fourth island) by the **BFB**, the cave entrance from that island will lead to an exit blocked by a **Stone Plug**. Mining this Plug will unlock the exit, which leads to a random **Cave Cleft** on any of the other 4 islands. This entrance does not have to be re-mined in order to travel through it again.

It is possible to find one or more **Vampire Bat(s)** sleeping inside. They will remain asleep unless intentionally woken up either by attacking it or from being hit with debris from a cave-in.

While inside a **Cave Cleft**, the character loses no **Sanity** because of the darkness.

## Bugs
*Dying in a different world (any of the three DLC realms, as well as caves, ruins, and the volcano) and respawning from a **Meat Effigy** or **Magic Flower** that was placed inside any **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC interior (Slanty Shanty etc.) will cause the player to be respawned out in the void of the world holding the respawn structure. It is recommended to use the command c_warp("'prefab'") to teleport the character back into the world, as walking back in can be problematic for world types such as **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**.

## Tips
* It is advised to visit these caves in the very early stages of the game to obtain **Gold Nuggets** to build a **Science Machine** or **Alchemy Engine**.
*Killing sleeping **Vampire Bats** will reduce the size of upcoming **Vampire Bat** attack waves.

## Description
Living Logs are [[Item]]s dropped by deceased [[Treeguard]]s. They can also be obtained by [[Axe|chopping]] down [[Totally Normal Tree]]s, the stump of Totally Normal Tree can be dug for another Living Log. [[Wormwood]] can always "craft" Living Logs at the cost of 20 Health.

They are used to craft several magic items, including a [[Shadow Manipulator]], and can also be used as fuel for a [[Fire]]. Living Logs will scream when burned on a fire and when eaten by the [[Woodie/Cursed|Werebeaver]] form of [[Woodie]] or the [[Doydoy]], though this has no effect on gameplay.

__NOTOC__
[[Tree/Birchnut|Poison Birchnut Trees]] also drop Living Logs.
In ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' the [[Mush Gnome]] drops Living Logs upon death.

## Usage
A Living Log may be used to repair a [[Wood Wall]]. This works in a similar fashion to using a standard log, except that the Living Log repairs three times the wall health of a standard log.

A Living Log can be used to fuel a fire.

## Scrapbook Info
Can be placed on dirt ground to change the type of ground.

Deciduous Turf is one of the Turf items that appears in Don't Starve Together. It is commonly found in Deciduous Forest. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as fuel.

Plants like Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Lureplants, Pine Cones, and Birchnuts can be planted on these Turfs. It will not stop Lureplants' Eyeplants from spawning.

When placed on the Surface World in a large enough area, Crows are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs.

Deciduous Turf can be crafted and prototyped with 1 Twigs and 1 Birchnut at Terra Firma Tamper in the Decorations Filter.

The Thulecite Suit is a craftable Item found in the Ancient Pseudoscience Filter. It requires 4 Nightmare Fuel, 6 Thulecite and an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. It also has a 33% chance to be found inside a Large Ornate Chest. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Thulecite Suits cannot be prototyped and Characters always need to be near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft them again.

When equipped in the chest slot, the Thulecite Suit acts as an Armor that will absorb 90% of physical damage and has 1800 Durability. While equipped it also increases the Character's Sanity by 3.3 sanity per minute. Not considering its durability, the Thulecite Suit effectively adds 1350 hp to the average survivor.

Thulecite creation is lost to time in the base version of Don't Starve, therefore only a limited number of Thulecite Suits can be crafted.

Players have a 0.02% chance of finding Green Gems inside Tumbleweeds, thus making Thulecite Suits renewable, since more Thulecite can be gained with the use of Construction Amulets and Deconstruction Staves as described below.

## Skins
- The **Woven - Elegant Jagged Grand Suit**, **Silken Grand Suit**, **Steadfast Grand Suit**, and **Whispering Grand Suit** skins were introduced during the official The Forge event in 2018.
- The **Loyal Nouveau Crown** skin was awarded for watching 3 hours of Don't Starve Together on Twitch from July 27, 2022 to August 10, 2022.

## Tips
- While providing slightly less protection compared to the Night Armor and Marble Suit, the Thulecite has more Durability and no drawbacks, making it more favorable to craft.
- Unlike Dress items, wearing the Thulecite Suit to regain Sanity will not decrease its durability, allowing infinite Sanity regeneration, as long as players don't get hit enough for it to break.
- It is possible to use a Construction Amulet to craft 5 Thulecite Suits for 15 Thulecite, then use a Deconstruction Staff on those 5

By using a [Fishing Rod], the player can obtain [Tropical Fish] from Tidal Pools. [Fishermerm]s can also harvest Tropical Fish from Tidal Pools, however they will not eat the fish, allowing the player to collect them. Tidal Pools contain a maximum of 10 Tropical Fish, and they spawn a new one every 160 seconds if there are less than 10.

## Scrapbook Info

Can be planted in ground.

## Description

The **Spiky Bush** is an in-game flora commonly found in Marsh and Desert biomes. It acts as a source of Twigs, like Saplings. Spiky Bushes are not affected by Winter cold and will regrow after 4 game days during both Summer and in Winter. Harvesting Twigs from a spiky bush damages health by 3 points.

Spiky Bushes can be dug up with a Shovel and replanted in a new location. This gives a Twig and an equivalent Sapling and is the safer way of getting Twigs, as digging and picking up a Spiky Bush does not damage the player. The bushes themselves can also be used as an effective fuel for Campfires, though they are not renewable. In this regard, they are similar to Saplings and Grass Tufts.

Spiky Bushes can't be planted on Checkerboard Floorings, Wooden Floorings, Cobblestones, Carpeted Floorings, Rocky Turfs, Sandy Turfs, and Cave Rock Turfs, unless it has been planted before these turfs were placed.

Spiky Bushes can also be found in the Desert biome.

## Tips

- Spiky Bushes can be safely harvested with a Bramble Husk equipped, without losing health. The Bramble Husk also won't lose durability.
- With the Don't Starve Mega Update new mechanic changes, players can now collect, pick up items, craft and load weapons while mounted on beefalos. This makes harvesting twigs from spiky bushes have no player health penalty at all, while the thorns damage goes to the beefalo, increasing its ornery tendency points.

## Trivia

- There are two texture sets in the game, one in darker gray the other in very light, ashen gray. This is merely a cosmetic, visual difference and has no impact on the game.

![Umbrella Dropped](Umbrella Dropped.png) ![Umbrella](Umbrella.png)

The **Umbrella** is a **Survival** item that negates **Sanity** loss caused by **Rain** while equipped.

## Downloadable Content

In **DLC**s the Umbrella slows the rate at which the player gains **Wetness** by 90% and provides moderate protection from **Overheating**. It now also loses durability when passively held, like other **Dress** items. It can be repaired with a **Sewing Kit** for 83% durability. It will no longer prevent WX-78 from being struck by Lightning.

Because the durability has been tied to time being equipped, the umbrella is no longer a weapon, and attacking with it causes a generic punch damage (10 by default), costing no extra durability when used this way.

In the **Hamlet** DLC, Umbrellas can be bought for 10 **Oinc**s at the **Pigg and Pigglet's General Store**.

## Usage

**Recipe:**

| Item   | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Umbrella | 1 |
| Shark Gills | 2 |
| Straw Hat | 1 |
| Result: | Dumbrella |
| Tool: | Alchemy Engine |
| DLC: | Shipwrecked |

## Tips

For 100% water resistance, a player can hold an umbrella while wearing a **Battle Helm**, **Beefalo Hat**, **Breezy Vest**, **Football Helmet**, **Miner Hat**, **Rain Hat**, **Shelmet**, **Spiderhat**, **Straw Hat**, **Summer Frest**, or **Top Hat**.

## Trivia

- The Umbrella was added during **A Little Rain Must Fall** update of **Don't Starve's** beta testing period.

- Wheeler: Looks useful. I should go hunting for more of these.
- Wortox: My eye was caught by its dull glint.
- Walter: This should come in handy!
- Wanda: Aha, I've found some flint!
- Choose: Wolfgang

Flint is an item used to craft basic tools. It can be found on the ground or by mining smooth or gold veined Boulders with the Pickaxe. Flint is not flammable and easy to find on the surface, although eventually it can be used up. More can be found by venturing into a Cave, however.

Flint can be given to Rock Lobsters to befriend them. Like all mineral items, they are food sources for Slurtles and Snurtles.

Flint is one of the first and most needed items in the game and should be sought after as soon as a new game starts. It is recommended to always have a decent number of flint at all times in the case the player needs to make basic Tools such as an Axe or a Pickaxe. Combat wise, the Spear can be built.

Flint is a renewable resource:
- In Reign of Giants, it can be farmed from Moleworms, Rock Lobsters, and from Earthquakes in the caves.
- In Shipwrecked, it's rather more difficult, being generated by the Slot Machine and from mined or hatched Dragoon Eggs.
- In Hamlet it's a very common drop from Dung Balls which are renewable if you also kill the Dung Beetle. Also they are available at the Pigg and Piglet's General Store for 1x Oinc each.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, the Walking Cane cannot be crafted since **MacTusk** is not present. However, it can be obtained by using the **Slot Machine**, or as possible loot from the **Quacken**.

In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, the Walking Cane crafting recipe is unavailable, however, a **Blueprint** for it can be bought with 500 **Oinc**s from **The Tinkerer's Tower**. The Walrus Tusk is available at **The Sty' Oddities Emporium**.

In both these DLCs, the Walking Cane can also be used while sailing on **Boats**, providing the same speed boost.

## Usage

### Recipe

- **Item 1:** Walking Cane
- **Item 2:** Nightmare Fuel (count 2)
- **Item 3:** Orange Gem (count 2)
- **Result:** The Lazy Explorer

### Tips

- The Walking Cane can also be used as a weapon, although it is amongst the weakest in the game, as it only deals half the damage of a **Spear** when used as a weapon. However, it has an infinite durability, so it can be swung indefinitely.
- The Walking Cane's speed boost puts the **Character** on the same level as many other creatures who could otherwise outrun them, including **Followers** like **Chester**. This is amplified by both **Trail** natural and **Cobblestones** Cobble

### Usage
To chop down a Tree with the Axe, players can right-click it from the inventory to equip it and left-click the Tree (Or press "X" in the console edition). Once the player begins to chop the Tree, holding down the LMB or Spacebar will have the player character keep chopping until the Tree falls. Alternatively, one can chop faster by repeatedly clicking LMB with specific timing.

- The Luxury Axe was added in the October 2, 2012 update.
- The Axe used to have a value of 1-10 Science Points depending on its durability when used on a Science Machine, while the Luxury Axe gave 1-35.
