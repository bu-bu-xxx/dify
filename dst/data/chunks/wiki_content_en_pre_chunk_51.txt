# Wavey Jones
'''Wavey Jones''' is a Shadow Creature exclusive to ''Don't Starve Together'' introduced in ''[[Return of Them]]''. A Wavey Jones spawns on the ocean in place of Night Hands, appearing for players with sanity below 75%. It attaches to the border of a boat and spawns two hands on the deck.

The two hands try to raise [[Anchor Kit|Anchors]] and [[Mast]]s and lower [[Winged Sail]]s. If a player on the boat has less than 50% sanity they also try to extinguish [[Fire]]s. If a player has less than 25% sanity they also try to remove [[Boat Patch]]es and [[Trusty Tape]]s. Removed Boat Patches create a small leak, 50 hull damage and drops 1 Boat Patch. Removed Trusty Tapes create a small leak and drop a Trusty Tape.

Players can stay close to the hands to force them to retract briefly. Wavey Jones's body will be driven off by the proximity of a player, but will reappear 10 seconds later. Wavey Jones disappears completely after being driven off for the third time or when daylight appears.

## Trivia
### In-Game
* Wavey Jones and Terrorclaws were introduced in the ''[[Return of Them#Troubled Waters|Troubled Waters]]'' update.

### Cultural References
* Wavey Jones' name is a reference to the phrase Davy Jones' Locker, which is a common metaphor for drowning among sailors.

# Sustainable Life Underground Guide

This guide concerns sustainable life underground - in **Caves** and **Ruins**. Sustainable life means being able to survive for an indefinite period of time without needing to exit the current level. The guide contains instructions and opinions on the matter, and every player is free to find their own playstyle and methods for achieving the goal of sustainable underground life.

## Basics of the Underground Environment

### Caves
Caves and Ruins are free from all weather in the base version - it is permanently **Summer**, with a constant temperature and no Rain or Lightning. In Reign of Giants and Don't Starve Together, seasons DO affect the caves, causing freezing and heating. Occasionally, **Earthquakes** can happen on both levels, which drop **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Nitre**, **Gold Nuggets**, **Red Gems**, **Blue Gems**, or **Marble**, but the falling minerals will damage the player if they manage to directly hit them. It is permanently dark, and the player loses 5 **Sanity** per minute, regardless of the time of day. So better have a base up there too and make a lot of **Pumpkin Cookies** (see taffy recipe) or **taffy**.

Caves have a **day** and night cycle, as well as a **Moon Cycle**, although neither is clearly visible (there is no clock in the top right corner of the screen). The current state could be determined by listening to the music and by checking into a shaft of natural light. The shafts of natural light are patches of ground where light reaches from the surface. They could contain **Evergreen**s, **Grass Tuft**s, **Saplings**, or **Berry Bush**es, or they could be in an underground **Marsh**.

### Ruins
Ruins have no day and night cycle - it is permanent night for gameplay purposes. This means that surface animals that have been brought down - **Pigs**, **Rabbits**, **Bees**, **Beefalo**, or Flying **Birds** - are always asleep. Instead, there is a **Nightmare Cycle**, which alters the appearance of the place and causes **Shadow Creatures** to spawn from **Nightmare Lights** and **Nightmare Fissures**. There are no shafts of natural light and there is no way to tell what time it is. The Moon Cycle still affects the Ruins, albeit invisibly.

## Preparation

Before being able to live sustainably and indefinitely underground, one needs to gather all the non-renewable resources, required for sustainable life above ground. These include, but are not limited to: **Grass Tufts**, **Saplings**, **Berry Bushes**, **Honeycomb**s, **Bees**, **Pine Cones**, **Pig Skin**s, **Seeds**, **Fleshy Bulb**s, and a living Flying **Bird**. These would enable resources, such as **Grass**, **Twigs**, **Berries** (with occasional **Gobblers**), **Honey** and **Bees**, **Logs** and Living **Logs**, and **Pig Skins** to become renewable underground. The remaining resources, required for the construction of a camp underground, such as **Gold** and **Rocks** are already renewable and highly abundant there.

Also, because followers could be brought down, one can lure up to 5 **Beefalo** at a time and make **Beefalo Wool**, **Meat**, and **Beefalo Horn**s a renewable resource underground.

## Location of the Camp

### Caves
In Caves, there are shafts of natural light containing **Evergreens**, **Grass Tufts**, **Saplings**, and **Berry Bushes**. Rarely, the Shaft could also contain a version of the Cave Camp **Set Piece**, which includes a Frog **Pond**. These shafts are a good place for the camp (except if the shaft contains a Pond, in which case **Frogs** will be a constant nuisance). Try to place your **Tent** inside such a shaft, so when you sleep and your fires are extinguished, you don`t wake up in total darkness.

### Ruins
In Ruins, there are no shafts of natural light, and there are Nightmare Lights and Nightmare Fissures, which will spawn Shadow Creatures during the Nightmare Phase. The camp should be placed as far away from any Nightmare Lights and Fissures as possible. A good camp location is on the edge of a Light Flower field. **Walls** (upgraded at least once) could be used to

# Character Selection

## Healers
Every group should have a healer. The best options for healing are:
- **Winona** (faster cooldown)
- **Wickerbottom** (30% spell amplify)
Other characters that can use the healing staff include:
- **Willow**
- **Wendy**
- **Wes**
- **Maxwell**

## Reviver
For reviving, **Wilson** is the best option as he revives twice as fast and with three times more health. Otherwise, the healer is best for reviving.

## Runner
Another important character is the runner. The best options for running are:
- **Wes** (less likely to lose aggro and faster to revive)
- **Woodie** (can easily aggro enemies with Lucy)
Their job is to keep the boss enemies distracted by getting its aggro and running away from it while the other players focus on defeating the smaller enemies.

## Tank
The best tanks are:
- **WX-78** (because he shocks enemies when attacked)
- **Wolfgang** (because of his mightiness and high health)
It's best to have two tanks or one tank and **Wigfried** or **Winona** to support the tank.

## Mage
It is also useful to have a mage in the group, which can be either **Wickerbottom** or **Maxwell**. They can use their book to petrify enemies.

## Other Useful Characters
- **Willow** for using the fire staff or molten darts because of increased fire damage and for protection by Bernie.
- **Wendy** for Abigail.
- **Webber** for Baby Spiders.

# Items

## Healer
The healer of the group should get:
- **Living Staff** (for healing)
- **Silken Wood Armor** (for faster cooldown)
- Either **Crystal Tiara** (for faster cooldown) or **Woven Garland** (for 20% more healing). Before the Woven Garland drops, it might be useful to let the healer use the Crystal Tiara first. Later on, it might be useful for the healer to switch to the Woven Garland.

## Runner
The runner of the group should get:
- **Feathered Wreath** for +20% movement speed
- **Feathered Reed Tunic** for +10% movement speed. As the Feathered Reed Tunic does not drop, another group member (Willow, Wendy, Wes, Wigfried, or Webber) should give their starter armor to the runner. The best weapons for running are **Lucy** (because of easier drawn aggro) and darts.

## Tank
The tank should equip themselves with:
- **Steadfast Stone Armor** (90 defense and resistance to knockbacks)
- **Resplendent Nox Helm** (+15% physical damage) or **Flower Headband** (+25% healing received) or **Blossomed Wreath** (+2HP/s).
The second best armor for the tank are:
- **Stone Splint Mail** (85 defense)
- **Jagged Wood Armor** (+10% physical damage)
The second best head piece is the **Nox Helm** (+15% physical damage), third best is the **Barbed Helm** (+10% physical damage).

## Mage
The mage should be given the other **Silken Wood Armor** and the **Crystal Tiara** for cooldown. They can toggle between different weapons as the cooldown is associated with the weapon and not the person wielding it. They should use the **Petryfing Tome** or the **Tome of Beckoning**. If there is no **Willow**, whoever wants to wield the **Infernal Staff** can also use it, and if no one else is the healer, they should use the **Living Staff**.

## Infernal Staff User
The one wielding the **Infernal Staff** should also wear the **Clairvoyant Crown** (+25% Magic damage and cooldown).

# Gameplay

## Strategy
What is most important is that in the healing circle, no sleeping enemies should be attacked as they will wake up and damage the players that are trying to heal. Also, enemies that are petrified should not be attacked.

The best strategy is to lure all enemies into the healing circle to let them fall asleep and when they are about to wake up, to petrify them to give the players special attack the time to cooldown. Only one enemy should be attacked. When they are about to escape from their petrification, they should be attacked by the special attacks.

It is also important that all players try to focus on one enemy (except for the runner who will try to lure away the other enemies and the mage who will petrify the other enemies). Especially in the case

# Behavior

When within 12 units of the deer, Gem Deer will shine their gem to perform a magical attack on the player. The attacks affect the land around the player, giving them a short time to move away before being affected themselves. Each type has different powers:

- **Red Gem type**: Melts the land, which sets lingering players on fire. Immune to fire-related weapons such as the Fire Staff and Fire Dart. Vulnerable to freezing weapons such as the Ice Staff.
- **Blue Gem type**: Freezes the land, which freezes lingering players. Immune to freezing weapons and vulnerable to fire-related weapons.

# Trivia

- Gem Deer were introduced in the Winter's Feast update, alongside the event of the same name.
- During the Winter's Feast event, Gem Deer have a slightly different appearance. Their head and chest fur is silvery white instead of light-brown. Also, their collars and chains are golden and ornamented with bells rather than colored in iron.
- Spawning the Gem Deer without Klaus using Console Commands will cause them to permanently change into regular No-Eyed Deer after a few seconds.
- Attacking the Gem Deer after Klaus has been defeated, and before the Gem Deer have freed themselves, will cause them to chase the player and cast their respective powers before becoming unchained a few seconds later.

# Pig Farming

Pig Farming is an easy and simple way to gather large quantities of **meat** and **Pig Skin|pig skin**. With a proper pig farm, a player can create a reliable way to not starve.

## Gathering Pigs

The first part of the pig farm is the pigs. With a **hammer**, destroy as many **Pig House|pig houses** as you can. Although pig houses can be encountered in any area on occasion, the best way to find a lot of pig houses is by finding the **Pig King**'s village, which can be found in the **Deciduous Forest**. Pigs will not be hostile if their home is destroyed.

## Building the Pig Farm

Once you have destroyed as many pig houses as you desire, find a good location to build your farm. The ideal spot is somewhat close to your base, but not too close. Remember to distance it from any **Sinkhole|sinkholes** or **Spider Den|spider dens** to avoid the pigs getting distracted. Build a small pen of stone walls with a single pig skin in the middle, and some pig houses surrounding it. When day comes, the pigs will come out of their houses and try to eat the pig skin by walking into the wall. They will continue this, even at night.

## Harvesting the Pig Farm

Wait for a full moon to harvest the pig farm. Equip a **spear** and **Log Suit|log suit** if you do not already have a **Ham Bat|ham bat**. When the pigs turn into **Werepig|Werepigs**, attack and kill them one by one. Once you have killed one, craft a ham bat if you were using a spear, and use it on the rest of the pigs.

Continue killing the werepigs until they are all dead or day comes, whichever is first. Afterwards, use the pig skin to craft some more pig houses and expand the farm.

# Farming

This guide is made for farming **saplings**, **grass tufts**, and **berry bushes**. It will teach you farming techniques from day 1 to 4 and onwards.

## Saplings, Grass Tufts, Berry Bushes, and Pine Cones

Saplings, grass, trees, and berry bushes are found in **grasslands**. In every biome (except **rockyland**) everything important for survival will be in any **biome**, including **mosaic** biome, **savanna** biome, **forest** biome (although not recommended, the abundance of trees can lead for large amount of **pine cones** as long you don't run out of **flint**), and Marsh biome (same as forest but with **spiky bushes** and no grass but **reeds**).

Your preferred biome would be a **grassland** or a **savanna**. Grasslands have small amounts of **rabbits** but fair amount of grass, berry bushes, and saplings. Savannas are most preferred. While having no **saplings** at all you will have an abundant amount of **grass tufts** and **rabbit holes**. While having only grass and rabbits, savanna have **beefaloes** which can multiply. You can choose to camp near the rabbits and beefalos. Caution, however, is advised to settling too close to beefaloes, as they become hostile during mating season (which can be seen through their red butts and constant bucking).

## Day 1

Start out by exploring most of the map. Pick everything you see, enough to have 15 of everything. Not too fast! Craft an **axe** with flint and twigs that you found and start chopping down **trees**; that's the most important thing you need to do. Stop when you have 9 **logs**, as it is enough. Chopping more trees is just a waste of time.

Once you have finished, carry on exploring, probably will be about dusk, but don't make a campfire. It is better to wait until you have 2 spare clocks until night. That is the best moment to make a fire. Then drop 1 log in the campfire and cook some berries (3-4 along with carrots if you want).

## Day 2

After night is over, you want to pick more grass and everything too. When you find a savanna, find a good amount of rabbits and make a trap, 6+ rabbits are preferred, so set a trap around many rabbits. Start exploring more. It's about to be dusk and you may have found a rockyland, you have some spare flint? Then make a pickaxe, and mine 11 gold veined boulders that drop **gold nuggets**. Once you mined enough, make a fire. Cook up 3-4 berries and wait for the next day. You may have spare logs, so build a science machine, prototype a **razor** (if you need it), a **shovel**, and **backpack**, soon when the day ends, prototype a log suit, a spear, and it's probably enough.

## Day 3

And now, you must dig up everything to about 20 (berry bushes is enough to be 15-10). When done, you must explore more of savanna and when you find a forest **WITHOUT A ROAD**, explore it, it may end up into savanna full of **beefaloes**! Beefaloes are needed to have an infinite amount of fuel without wasting logs, free food source (you can make improved farms with that!). But don't set a fire pit near them. Set up where you marked a trap (so you will have rabbits). Make a science machine once again, and chop some trees for logs. It will probably be night, if you are far from camp, make a campfire and cook berries once again you found while exploring.

## Day 4+

During this day, you may take a little rest from exploring. Go back to the beefalo herd and harvest some manure. Once you have harvested 10-20, you may want to go back to your campsite. Now you must plant your saplings, grass tufts, and berry bushes. Fertilize everything, especially the berry bushes. After the fertilization, you may want to prototype an **alchemy engine** with your science machine: prototype 4 boards along with 2 cut stone, and make an **alchemy engine**. After these days, you probably want to harvest more manure and dig up more tufts along with saplings and fertilize them.

You can also prototype **improved farms** to grow **crops**!

When you can, you can dig **graves** and find **gears**, you can

## Behavior

Powder Monkeys populate the area around the **Queen of Moon Quay** and on the **Docks**. They have an inventory of 20 slots used for items they pick up from the ground. They will knock items out of the players' inventory on sight, similar to Frogs, but without doing any damage unless a player strikes back, causing other Powder Monkeys in a large radius to join the fight. Powder Monkeys, if not attacked, will not harass players who have the **Right of Passage** or **Wonkey**.

All knocked-out items are picked up by the monkeys and moved to their inventory. If the item is a **Banana**, the Monkeys will take it as a gift to the **Queen of Moon Quay**. Stolen items can be retrieved by killing the Powder Monkey who stole it or, after it escaped into a **Monkey Hut**, finding a **Pirate Stash**.

Monkeys are able to empty **Chests**, knocking the items on the floor to steal them, similar to **Krampus**. Dropped **Backpacks** and **Ice Boxes** are not targeted.

Additionally, Powder Monkeys will use any nearby **Cannons** if it is facing a boat, launching **Cannonballs** at the player.

# Deerclops Encounter Preparation

Deerclops is one of the first major obstacles a player will encounter in an Reign of Giants (RoG) or Don't Starve Together (DST) world if starting in Autumn. Its sanity drain and intense Area of Effect (AoE) attacks mean you will have to prepare thoroughly if you want to survive winter.

## Winter Survival Essentials

Before you start preparing for Deerclops, you will have to have enough tools and resources to survive a standard winter. Skip to the sixth paragraph if you already have the stuff to survive winter.

### Thermal Stones
Make two thermal stones and keep one by your fire pit and one in your inventory at all times. When the thermal stone in your inventory goes cold, swap it out for the one by the fire.

### Logs and Base Location
You should gather enough logs in winter to keep your fire going all day. Making your base near a lumpy evergreen forest is a good idea, as they produce 3 logs per fully grown tree (4 if you dig up the stump) and you don't have to worry about replanting them. This is a short-term solution, however. If you want a renewable source of wood, plant a grove of evergreens near your base, as twiggy trees do not produce much wood and birchnut trees do not drop birchnuts during winter as they are deciduous.

### Insulation Clothing
Making a clothing item for insulation is advisable, though not necessary. A beefalo hat or winter hat is good for your first year, although for the next years you may want to consider hunting Koalefants to make a Breezy or Puffy Vest. If playing as Wilson or Webber, do not shave your beard during winter, as it can be used for insulation.

## Preparing for Deerclops

You should start preparing for Deerclops about five days in advance (about day 25). You should have the above materials by then.

### Weapon
The first thing you will need is a weapon. For your first year, a ham bat will do. Feed a pig four pieces of monster meat (easily obtainable from hounds or spiders) to turn it into a Werepig. Werepigs have a simpler kiting pattern than pigs and defeating one should prove easy enough if you have a spear and a log suit. Use the drops from the Werepig to make a ham bat. You should at least wait until winter before you do this though, or the ham bat will spoil. If you are playing as Wigfrid and don't have enough time to make a ham bat or can't find any pigs, a Battle Spear will do.

### Boomerangs and Darts
Alternatively, burn some trees to collect charcoal. Using the charcoal, make some boomerang. Only do this if you have enough silk though. 15 boomerangs will do enough damage to defeat Deerclops, although you may want to craft more boomerangs for practice or as backup. Remember you will need a total of 60 logs to make that many boomerangs, so a luxury axe is advisable if you don't want to be crafting new axes repeatedly. If you have a bird trap, gather some feathers from birds to make darts, as those are a suitable ranged weapon as well. Remember you will need reeds to make all kinds of darts, though, meaning you will have to visit a swamp.

### Health and Sanity Replenishment
You will need to replenish your health and sanity during the fight, as Deerclops' attacks pack a punch and its insanity aura is one of the worst in the game. Pierogi is a good idea, as the eggs are easily obtainable from Pengulls during winter and the other ingredients can be either foraged for or obtained from traps. Pierogi also regenerates more health than other crock pot foods, and replenishes sanity as well. Even without ponds to fish from, Fishsticks can be made by entering the swamp and sweeping up after Merm and Tentacle battles.

Dragonpie can be used, although you will need a birdcage to produce dragonfruit seeds if you are to produce a lot of it. Dragonpie is an effective health regen and also regenerates sanity. Beware though; as it is not a meat item, Wigfrid cannot eat it.

Taffy and Jerky are both good options to regain lost sanity, however you will need to take down some bees or make a bee box for taffy, and remember that bee boxes do not make honey during winter. You will need to prepare jerky in advance, as it takes quite some time to dry.

### Character-Specific Preparations
Some characters will not have to prepare this way, as Wigfrid can regain lost health and sanity simply from fighting and Maxwell can easily regain lost sanity from his dapper personality. Glommer can also

# Wolfgang - The Strongman Guide

This guide will introduce you to Wolfgang - The Strongman - and explain some strategies to get the most out of his muscles while managing his weaknesses. For more basic information and trivia on Wolfgang, please visit the character page [here](#).

![Wolfgang](Wolfgang.png){:width="300px" style="float: right;"} 

> "I am mighty! No one is mightier!" - Wolfgang

## Background

Wolfgang is the strongest character in the game, potentially dealing double the damage of other characters when in his mighty form, in addition to gaining extra health and a slight speed boost. These benefits depend on the hunger value when he is in mighty form. For example, when hunger is capped at 300 Wolfgang will deal 2x damage, have 300 HP and gain the maximum speed boost, but as hunger decreases so will the magnitude of all three of these stats.

![Wolfgang forms](Wolfgang%20forms.png){:width="400px" style="float: right;"}

Here is an image showing you the various forms as well as the different gains/losses in health and damage. Wolfgang's hunger will decrease 3x faster when in Mighty/Mightiest form, 1.5x faster when in Normal form, and 1x when in Wimpy form. Due to the increased hunger drain when in mighty form, it is advised to only eat foods when necessary (before combat, avoid starvation, etc.). 

![Wolfgang drain slow](Wolfgang%20drain%20slow.gif){:width="300px" style="float: right;"}

Because Wolfgang's health pool also increases/decreases depending on hunger, it is actually beneficial to hold off on healing until he is wimpy form. For example, after combat Wolfgang is at 40% health in mighty form. If Wolfgang heals now, he will have to heal a significant amount of HP, which requires more resources. Instead, the player should wait until wimpy form, at which point each % of total HP is smaller and thus getting back to 100% health will be more efficient.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- High damage output (up to 2x regular damage with a full belly)
- High health (again, dependent on hunger but up to 300 HP)
- Suits aggressive, combat-oriented playstyle

Wolfgang has the potential to 2-hit spiders or frogs with a spear, or make short work of intimidating mobs such as Depth Worms or Terrorbeaks that other characters would take longer to kill off. The stronger the weapon, the higher the benefits of his Mighty form. This coupled with his health boost suits players who enjoy combat or who prefer his extra strength to survive in harsh environments such as caves, ruins, etc.

### Cons
- Hunger drains faster
- Sanity drains faster from darkness and mobs
- Survival inside caves is difficult without sanity-items

Despite Wolfgang's strengths, if you are not thriving in your game then you will more likely notice his weaknesses. He seems to always be hungry no matter how much you feed him, and before you know it your sanity is below half because of the drain from nights/caves. Success on Wolfgang depends highly on your ability to constantly create filling foods and sanity-restoring items. Venturing into the caves is particularly draining on sanity levels if you are unprepared, and facing multiple worms in addition to hallucinations is one of the worst situations to be in. All this is easily countered though, and with time you won't find them to be too harsh on you.

## Strategy #1: Early Game (Days 1-20)

### Exploration + Base Camp Selection
![Wolfgang Pots and Racks](Wolfgang%20Pots%20and%20Racks.png){:width="362px" style="float: right;"}

The first few days should be spent in nomadic fashion, only stopping to chop down necessary trees/boulders for wood, rocks, flint and gold. During the nights, try to find groups of trees (not forests) that can be burned for charcoal, which you will need later for crock pots and dry racks. This way, you will not even have to build a campfire and continue being productive at night. To counter the sanity drain in the first days, make sure to make a garland (or a top hat if you can) and pick all the flowers you can when at 195 sanity or lower. Remember that making a garland gives 60 sanity from the flowers you pick to make it too.

During resource collection, you should continue to explore as much as you can. Hopefully you will identify key locations that you want to be close to. This is better achieved by walking along the shore. This way you have an exact idea on the




# Finding A Camp And Building It

## Pre-camp Exploration
Pre-camp exploration is crucial for understanding resource locations and optimal camp setups. It's advisable to establish camp at corners of as many [[Biomes]] as possible to facilitate material and food gathering. Additionally, setting up camp near [[Beefalo]]s or [[Pig]]s for [[Manure]] can simplify food creation and reduce the risk of starvation. However, be mindful that both [[Pig|Pigs]] and [[Beefalo]] can relocate later on. Enemies like [[Hound|Hounds]] can be attracted to them for protection, but avoid building too close as they can become hostile. Under a full moon, [[Pig|pigs]] turn into werepigs and attack, while [[Beefalo]] may attack during mating seasons (which can be calmed with a [[Salt Lick|salt lick]]).

## Long-Term Survival
For long-term survival, consider non-relocatable resource pools like [[Reeds]], [[Cactus|Cacti]], rabbit holes, and the [[Pig King]]. Prioritize locations near renewable resources over non-renewable ones like boulders. If necessary resources are far from the base camp, consider building an outpost near those resources or relocating the base near a Worm Hole close to the needed resources.

## Difficult Biomes for Base Setup
- **[[Forest]]:** The numerous [[Tree]]s can obstruct progress, requiring chopping, which is resourceful but time-consuming. Creating a basic [[Campfire]] near a tree can help clear a large area quickly. Chopping Burnt Trees yields [[Charcoal]] for a [[Crock Pot]] or [[Drying Rack]].
- **[[Rockyland]]:** The stone ground makes planting [[Berry Bushes]], [[Saplings]], Trees, and [[Grass Tufts]] impossible. Consider camping just off the edge for easy access to [[Boulder]]s and farming.
- **[[Swamp]]:** Early game camps should avoid swamps due to [[Tentacles]], [[Merms]], and [[Mosquito]]es. However, camping near a swamp can provide quick access to [[Reeds]].

## Base Camp Set-up Guide
- Place the fire pit just inland from an [[Ocean]] if basing near one.
- Place research machines ([[Science Machine]] or [[Alchemy Engine]]) inland, near the Fire Pit.
- Collect [[Berry Bushes]] and plant them near [[Tooth Traps]] or [[Walls]] to trap and kill [[Gobblers]] easily.
- Gather [[Grass Tufts]], [[Saplings]], and [[Pine Cones]] and create farms near the Fire Pit.
- Hunt for [[Meat]] or [[Morsel]]s to last a long time, but be mindful of food spoilage.
- If a [[sinkhole]] is near, remember to make a camp there too. Refer to the [[Guides/Camping Underground|Camping Underground Guide]] for underground camping.
- Make a [[Lightning Rod]] to protect your base from lightning fires, and additional rods may be needed to cover the whole base.
- Spread out farms in lines of 10 to minimize fire damage.

## Semi-Passive Sustenance
Before winter, set up a sustainable food source:
1. Near a Pigman village, place a spider nest for a perpetual monster meat or meat farm. Cooked monster meat can be fed to a bird in a [[Birdcage]] for [[Egg]]s, a great food source.
2. Place rabbit traps directly on top of Rabbit Holes for a passive Rabbit catch.

## Biomes
{{Main|Biomes}}
- **[[Forest]]:** Sustainable Meat/Morsels from [[Pigs]], Rabbits, occasional [[Redbird|Redbirds]]/[[Crow|Crows]], and roaming Beefalo.
- **[[Swamp]]:** Abundant [[Monster Meat]], [[Fish]], and [[Frog Legs]], but dangerous due to [[Tentacles]], [[Merm]]s, [[Spider]]s, and [[Mosquito]]es.
- **[[Savanna]]:** Second best for food with [[Rabbit]]s and [[Beefalo]].
- **[[Grasslands]]:** Least threatening with plenty of [[Grass]] and Saplings for [[Trap]]s and a steady Morsel income.
- **[[Desert]]:** Abundant resources like [[Buzzard]]s, [[Cactus|Cacti]], [[Tumbleweed]]s, [[Boulder]]s, and [[Volt Goat]]s.
- **[[Deciduous Forest]]:** Abundant mushrooms, [[Pig King]] for [[Gold]], sustainable [[Pig]]s for Meat, and [[Catcoon]]s for easy Meat and/or Cat Tails.

# Instructional: Starting out

## 1: Starting out

So, you spawn at the very beginning of the day surrounded by trees and not a lot else. First, look for the basic resources. Scoop up **twigs**, **grass**, and **flint**. If you're starting in autumn, one torch will get you through the night. DO NOT attempt to make a campfire. By the time you need heat, you should be able to make a fire pit. Pick a direction and go that way until you find the coast, then follow that instead. Until you get full stacks of grass and twigs, pick up all you see. If you're playing as Wendy, don't craft any more torches - Abigail will do for now. However, anyone else should carry at least one torch (preferably two, but inventory space is a consideration). Even Willow - her lighter is much more expensive to replace than a torch.

## 2: Where to make a base

As you explore, mine boulders until you have enough to make a fire pit. Pick every berry you see, but leave the carrots. You might need them later, or someone else might. Chop down a few trees, too - enough to prototype that fire pit and have some pinecones or birchnuts, whichever you prefer, to plant at your future base. When you come across a cave - which may not be for several days - find a good spot fairly nearby, but not close enough that the Batilisks will attack you. They'll provide some monster meat and batilisk wings when you have to hole up for winter. Hopefully there's also at least one rabbit hole nearby. The natural resources don't matter much, though. Boulders aren't renewable, and you can transplant grass tufts, saplings, and your preferred breed of tree.

## 3: Setup

Plant a tree farm here and place down a fire pit. Build a science machine if you can, and gather the materials if you can't. If you're playing as Wormwood, plant 5-10 seeds. If you're not Wigfrid, try to get a Garden Digamajig. Also make a shovel. If you're near a rabbit hole, make a trap and try to get some rabbit earmuffs. Don't bother baiting the trap, just place it really close to the hole. Collect materials for a thermal stone and at least one drying rack.

## 4: Winter

When it's snowed for the first time, you're going to want to keep the fire going all the time. If you need to go away from the camp, stoke the fire up to the maximum heat before leaving. That time it takes to light the fire again could be the difference between life and death. I'm not even exaggerating. Go and fight those Batilisks every afternoon and dry the monster meat you get. It's for emergencies only, though. You'll probably have some veggies from farming, you might have an occasional morsel, you'll have batilisk wings - you'll probably be fine for a while. Keep chopping trees from the tree farm, and try not to starve!

## Also:

Please notify me of any character-specific information you feel should be added or of any typos you find. I might make another guide for summer strategies, but probably not for a while. Thanks for reading!

# Boss Drops Guide

This guide discusses items dropped by bosses in the game, including the following:

- Spider Hat
- Living Logs
- Bee Queen Crown
- Deerclops Eyeball
- Guardian's Horn
- Down Feathers
- Scales
- Thick Fur/Fur Tufts

For information on how to kill bosses, refer to the guide: [How to Kill the Giants](Guides/How to Kill the Giants).

## Spiderhats
Dropped from the [Spider Queen], Spiderhats cannot be crafted into anything and are used to transform into a spider-like form similar to [Webber] without downsides. They should be used for recruiting [Spiders] and massing them for battle.

**Do not use Spiderhats for:**
- Simply walking through spider-infested areas
- Engaging battle with Spiders
- Wetness resistance in [Reign of Giants]

If the hat has 5% durability left, repair it with a [Sewing Kit].

**Recipes:**
- Spiderhat can be repaired to produce Spider Gland or Silk infinitely.

## Living Logs
Living Logs should not be used as [Fuel] due to their value in obtaining [Magic Tab] items. They are dropped from [Palm Treeguard], [Poison Birchnut Tree]s, and [Totally Normal Tree]s.

Upon obtaining Living Logs, first build a [Shadow Manipulator], which requires 3 Living Logs, a [Purple Gem], and 7 [Nightmare Fuel] to access all Magic Items.

**Prioritize Magic Items based on:**
- [Seaworthy] for RoG/SW Merged saves
- [Dark Sword] for planning to kill another Boss
- [Bat Bat] for regaining health
- Avoid making [Telelocator Staff] & [Telelocator Focus] first due to high cost
- [Glossamer Saddle] if all 68 [Butterfly Wings] are available

When spelunking in ruins and finding the [Ancient Pseudoscience Station], build the [Deconstruction Staff] and [Construction Amulet] for renewability in RoG or a larger stockpile of unrenewable items in the base game.

**Recipes:**
- Living Log can be used to craft Icon Magic or Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

## Bee Queen Crown
Obtaining this item is long and tedious, and it should be handled with care. Its main use is turning [Insanity] auras into [Sanity] auras.

**Uses for Bee Queen Crown:**
- Stand near an evil flower for sanity gain
- Wearing both [Dark Sword] and [Night Armor] for increased sanity
- Standing near a pacified Treeguard or Spider Queen as Webber

Avoid standing around other players with the item, as it can anger them and make them unable to act. The item's durability is based on the number of hits, so it can provide 100 spm without needing repair.

**Recipes:**
- Bee Queen Crown can be repaired to produce Sanity Meter infinitely in [Don't Starve Together].

## Deerclops Eyeballs
Deerclops Eyeballs are dropped by killing the [Deerclops]. They should not be eaten and can be used for crafting instead.

**Uses for Deerclops Eyeballs:**
- First Eyeball should be used for the [Eyebrella] to combat rain and heat.
- Other Eyeballs should be used for [Houndius Shootius] to help with [Hounds] and potentially creating a Hound Farm with a [Varg].

**Recipes:**
- Eyebrella can be crafted using Deerclops Eyeball, Twigs, and Bone Shards.
- Houndius Shootius can be crafted using Deerclops Eyeball, Guardian's Horn, and Thulecite.

## Guardian's Horn
Dropped from the [Ancient Guardian], this item should not be eaten and should be turned into a [Houndius Shootius] immediately due to the Guardian spawning only once.

**Recipes:**
- Houndius Shootius can be crafted using Deerclops Eyeball, Guardian's Horn, and Thulecite.

## Down Feathers
Down feathers are dropped from [Moose/Goose] and her [Mosling]s.

**Uses for Down Feathers:**
- If the player has an [Eyebrella], make the [Weather Pain] for creature damage and farming living logs.
- If the player does not have an Eyebrella or has made 3 Weather Pains, make a [Luxury Fan] for cooling down and extinguishing fires.

**Recipes:**
- Weather Pain can be crafted using Down Feather, Volt Goat Horn, and Gears.
- Luxury Fan can be crafted using Down Feather, Cut Reeds, and Rope.

## Scales
Scales are dropped from the [Dragon

# Stranded (Days 1-5)
First off gather lots of [[Cut Grass]], [[Twigs]] ... Well, basically, materials. Make a [[Pickaxe]] and an [[Axe]] regardless of whether there are lots of rocks or trees nearby. Take the [[Eye Bone]] if found to summon [[Chester]] (this goes for any time in your playthrough, however). For the first [[Night]], if no [[Fire]] can be made, make 2 [[Torch]]es and stand around (It is better to scout, though). *Do not eat any [[food]] just yet if your [[hunger]] meter is mostly full.* Only eat food if the hunger bar is 35-40 or below. Gather [[Flower]]s too, just enough to make a [[Garland]] (12). Make a base camp complete with a [[Science Machine]] and a [[Fire Pit]] by [[Day]] 3, and try to find a [[Pig Village]] to settle down near if possible. Try to get a [[Crock Pot]] as soon as possible. Explore the world, and travel far from your base. This will help you find the things. If you find a Pig Village, don't setup a base too close to it, as [[Werepigs]] will spawn on Full Moons and after [http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Pig Pigs] consume 4 or more Monster Meats.

# Getting into the groove (Days 5-10)
By Day 9, try to have an [[Alchemy Engine]]. They are very important. Keep on gathering supplies. Also start catching lots of [[Rabbit]]s for food and as ingredients for a [[Prestihatitator|Prestihatitator.]] With this, [[Nightmare Fuel]] can be made, and be used to create a [[Divining Rod]], among other things. Also try to find [[Graves]] and to dig them up if your [[sanity]] is not too low. Get [[Gears]] for an [[Ice Box]] and a Divining Rod. Go to a [[Swamp]] and find an aggressive mob like [[Spider]]s or [[Merm]]s and lead them to a [[Tentacle]], and have them kill the Tentacle so it drops its [[Tentacle Spike]], a powerful [[Weapon]]. (Note: Pigs are useful for this task due to the fact you can befriend them with meat, unlike most critters.)

# Preparation (Days 10-21)
The main thing you want to do in this amount of time is to prepare for [[winter]]! That means, craft an [[Ice Box]], collecting lots of [[food]] to put in the [[Ice Box]], farms (actual farms or fertilized berry bushes near base) and a bee box for food during winter (Note: Farms cannot be used during Winter, and should be harvested beforehand). Craft higher tier [[weapons]] (Never know what dangers [[Winter]] has in store for you), make warm clothes such as hats, and coats. Also, Make at least 2 [[Thermal Stone|Thermal stones]]. Gather plenty of resources, such as [[Rocks]], [[Twigs]], [[Logs]], etc.

# Winter! (Day 21- 36)
Try to eat the least amount of [[food]] possible, because it needs to last you 15 days. Always hold a warm [[Thermal Stone]] in your pocket, And wear a warm clothing item too. Always keep the materials for 2 [[Fire|fires]] (One for when you start to [[freeze]], one for [[night]].). In [[winter]], you may want to try to craft a [[Prestihatitator]] if you haven't already done so. Make bird nets and keep a lot of [[traps]] around. Basically, you want to survive in [[winter]], and try to upgrade your base a little bit.

# Exploration (Day 36+)
After winter, you should be set. This may be difficult to survive, because this is the hardest part. You need to explore the land looking for [[Sinkhole|sinkholes]] to explore a descent amount of caves for better materials (this part is optional.) You then explore the land looking for parts to enter [[Adventure Mode|adventure mode]] with your [[Divining Rod|divining rod]]. If you see a [[Touch Stone|touch stone]], It is important to activate it because it acts as another life. While on touch stones, it is also advisable to build a small base with necessities nearby when possible to avoid a very short next life. Once found the portal you can go into the portal when created or you can escape the island with your parts. A third option is to

- **Stack:** 10
- **Burn Time:** 90/45 sec
- **Spawn Code:** `turf_volcano`

### Turf Info
- **Image:** ![Ground lava rock](https://example.com/Ground_lava_rock.png)
- **Pitchfork:** 1

### Quotes

- **Wilson:** Volcano-y turf.
- **Willow:** Hot footin'.
- **Woodie:** Just some ground, eh?
- **Maxwell:** It appears to be some turf.
- **Wagstaff:** Amazing! I can still see the lava underneath.
- **Wendy:** It's just ground.

## Description
**Volcano Turf** is one of the **Turf** **items** that appears in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, acquired by digging **Volcano** tiles with a **Pitchfork**. Like other **Turfs**, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as **Fire#Fuel**.

Plants like **Berry Bush**es, **Grass Tuft**s, **Saplings**, **Spiky Bush**es, **Bamboo Root**s, **Viney Bush Root**s, **Coconut**s, and **Jungle Tree Seed**s cannot be planted on these Turfs. **Elephant Cactus** and **Coffee Plant**s can be planted on these turfs. **Flooding** can happen on this turf, but this is not seen unless transported due to floods not spawning in the volcano.

**Lureplant**s can be planted on this Turf, but **Eyeplant**s cannot spawn, so it is great for Lureplant farms while not spending any more resources than those used to craft the Pitchfork.

When placed on the **Surface World** and the area is large enough, Toucans are the only **Birds** that will spawn and land on these turfs. During **Hurricane Season**, there are no birds that spawn and land on these turfs.

# Survival Guide for Don't Starve: Shipwrecked

This is a survival guide written primarily for the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, which introduces new gameplay mechanics and several other changes. Only techniques and strategies unique to **Shipwrecked** are discussed here. For players who have not played Don't Starve before, see [this guide](Getting Started Guide).

![Wilson stranded on an island](Stranded.png)

## Day 1
One should play Don't Starve how they usually play for the first day or two - collect resources and food, build a [Campfire] for the night, etc. The player will start on an island. Scout the island to get an idea of what resources are readily available, and what resources require a trip to a neighboring isle. Before being able to build a [Science Machine] for a [backpack], build a primitive version called the [Thatch Pack] for more carrying capacity. It might be a good idea to craft a [pickaxe], and mine [boulders], as [flint] can be scarce on the first island. When gathering trees for a Campfire, it is advised to chop down the tallest trees, as they give off the most wood and the seeds for planting new trees. If one chops down a [Palm Tree], the [Coconut]s can be hacked open with a [Machete] for [Halved Coconut]s, an edible food item. Jungle Trees can be chopped to obtain [Jungle Tree Seeds], which can be used for fuel for a fire, [Egg]s, and [Banana]s; however, be aware that [Snake]s may spawn.

## Day 2-5
For the second or third day, craft a [Machete] from the tools tab. Use the Machete to hack down four [Bamboo Patch]es and three [Viney Bush]es to make a [Raft] from Nautical tab, the wood raft could also be used if the player doesn't have a machete. Be careful when hacking viney bushes for the raft as snakes have a very big chance to spawn and attacking a snake almost always causes more to spawn.

Deploy the boat onto water and right click to start sailing. One can find [Seaweed] in shallow [oceans], which is a decent source of food in beginning days. Islands usually spawn in a ring, therefore the player should always sail on the edge between the shallow and the deep ocean. Most players only sail in one direction or in the direction of the waves, this is very dangerous in the first few days and it is strongly recommended to keep materials for a spare boat/boat repair kit. When one reaches medium and deep oceans, be sure to sail on the waves for a speed boost. This is accomplished by sailing into the wave from behind towards the direction wave is going. Be sure to avoid going into the waves the wrong direction, as this will add [Wetness] to the player and cause the boat to lose durability. If one is skilled at sailing, after much practice, one could 'compromise' with the waves. This is accomplished by going in one direction the wave is going, as waves do not go in just one direction, they go North-East, South-East, South-West, and North-West, however barely they could be. The Raft is superior to a [Log Raft] because of it's speed, although both the Raft and Log Raft have the same durability, 150.

### Tips:
- Explore the seas in circles near the discovered islands in case of need of landing. Searching far off, and finding no land for long time can lead to death.
- Pay attention to the color of the waters, as it indicates depth, meaning land, coral reef, tar, etc. can be nearby.
- Resources such as Twigs and [Gold Nugget]s are scarcer in **Shipwrecked**, so one may have to sail out to farther islands if one was unlucky. It is possible to spawn on an island without any particular resources, such as Flint.
- Be wary when chopping down [Tree/Palm Tree|Palm Trees]. [Coconut]s can fall onto the player's head, doing 20 HP damage each. It is possible for many coconuts to fall in a row.
- If hunting mobs such as [Spider]s or [Monkey]s for meat, be wary that [Crabbit]s will eat any food items they see on the ground.
- [Poison] is a new game mechanic, where players will slowly lose health and sanity for 3 days if [Anti Venom] is not consumed. As poison progressively worsen over time, it is very deadly. Poison is inflicted by yellow monsters such as poisonous [Snake]s, [Stink Ray]s
