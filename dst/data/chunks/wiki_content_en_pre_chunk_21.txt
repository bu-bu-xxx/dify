# Salt Lick

## Description
The Salt Lick is a structure found in the Tools Tab. It is used to keep your livestock content.

## Ingredients and Crafting
- Requires 2 Boards and 4 Nitre to craft.
- Can be prototyped at an Alchemy Engine.

## Structure Details
- Durability: 240 uses
- Tier: 2
- Tool: Can be Hammered
- Can be Burned: 1
- Perk: Keeps Beefalo domestication from reducing over time.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "How many licks does it take to get to the center?"
- Willow: "It's a big block of slobbery salt."
- Wolfgang: "Heh heh. Hair cow has funny tongue!"
- Wendy: "The beasts crave it..."
- WX78: "FLESHLINGS RUB THEIR FILTHY TONGUE-STUMPS ON IT"
- Wickerbottom: "A cube of sodium chloride to lure wild beasts."
- Woody: "My mouth's dry just looking at it."
- Maxwell: "So salty."
- Wagstaff: "A cube of sodium to placate my domesticated bovine."
- Wigfrid: "Minerals, not meat."
- Webb: "We really regret licking it. Blech."
- Walani: "Salt makes everything taste better. Even salt."
- Warly: "Too salty."
- Woodlegs: "Saltier than ol' Woodlegs."
- Wilba: "IT'S A BIG BLOCK O' SALT"
- Wormwood: "Lick rock. For Shaggy Buddy"
- Wheeler: "Swell. It's a big lump of salt."
- Winona: "Keeps livestock nice and docile."
- Wortox: "I've been told I don't make a lick of sense."
- Wurt: "What you mean, 'only for beefalo'?"
- Walter: "Don't eat that Woby, it's for the beefalo!"
- Wanda: "Imagine getting so distracted by a chunk of salt."
- Choose: "Webber"

## Tips
- Volt Goats and Koalefants cannot be domesticated nor will they gain domestication. Keeping them around a Salt Lick would only waste the uses of this structure with no benefits.
- The Beefalo can be "parked" close to a Salt Lick as they will stay in close proximity to it.

## Trivia
- The Salt Lick was first introduced to Don't Starve Together. It was later added to Don't Starve in the Quality of Life update.
- Salt Licks are considered to be part of A New Reign, even though they were introduced before the official start of the beta branch.
- Salt licks are real-life tools used particularly in zoos to give the ungulates all the minerals they normally obtain from mineral swamps.
- Wilson's quote is a reference to the classic Tootsie Pop slogan, "How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?"
- Contrary to its name, the Salt Lick is made with Nitre, not Salt Crystals. This may be to ensure that the Salt Lick is available for players to use before they have access to Salt Crystals, or because Salt Crystals were added to the game after the Salt Lick.

- **Wendy**: A fuzzy ball of emptiness.
- **WX-78**: THIS EXTERNAL STORAGE UNIT APPEARS TO BE SENTIENT

## Transformations

### Shadow Chester

Chester can transform under the magic of a Full Moon when filled with specific magic items in his 9 inventory slots. Filling all of Chester's inventory slots with at least one unit of Nightmare Fuel will create Shadow Chester, who has 3 more inventory slots bringing his inventory space to 12. Shadow Chester causes food inside him to spoil 50% faster, the same rate as if it were left on the ground. If Shadow Chester dies with items inside, the items will not be dropped.

### Snow Chester

Filling Chester instead with Blue Gems will turn him into Snow Chester. Snow Chester's ability causes food to last twice as long inside him, effectively turning Chester into a fuzzy and portable Ice Box. If Chester dies, he loses his transformation and returns as normal.

## Tips

- Eye Bone's location usually is close to the spawn and next to a road.
- Since Chester regenerates health at a fast rate, he can be a useful tool in restoring the player's health. If Chester is attacked with the Bat Bat, the player will regain health from the hit with no risk of being attacked but any followers will attack Chester. Chester's regeneration can be used to lure aggressive mobs like Spiders away from the player.
- It may be a good idea to keep the Eye Bone in a Backpack so that when armor is equipped, Chester will remain near the Backpack while enemies are dealt with. However, it may backfire if Chester dies in the combat he followed the player into.
- Krampus can steal the Eye Bone if it is in a Backpack. If Krampus despawns with the Eye Bone, it will be gone permanently.
- Chester can only transform into Shadow Chester or Snow Chester if the required materials to do so are placed inside the normal version of Chester. In other words, it is impossible for Shadow Chester to transform into Snow Chester (and vice versa).
- The Eye Bone can be dropped on the ground when not using Chester.
- Snow Chester cools down Thermal Stone if placed inside, allowing the players to combat Overheating during summer.

## Trivia

- Chester was added in the Spoiled Rotten update.
- Chester's name is a pun on him being a mobile chest.
- Chester is one of the few Mobs that cannot be frozen.
- Krampus cannot steal from Chester. However, Chester can be killed, allowing Krampus to steal items that were stored in Chester.
- Chester cannot be healed using healing items.
- If Fireflies are stored

## Ancient Pig Ruins
Ancient Pig Ruins are areas introduced in the Hamlet DLC. They can be accessed by entering a Ruinous Entrance, which can be found in the Plains, Rainforest, Deep Rainforest, or Gas Rainforest biomes. Clicking on the entrance will transport the player into an Indiana Jones-esque temple ruins containing many rooms connected to each other, complete with decorative wall art.

### Interior
Rooms will often include an assortment of hostile mobs like Batilisks, Scorpions, or Vipers, and many rooms will contain Unimportant Pillars or Smashing Pots. Some rooms will contain a Wishing Well or statues that can be chiseled for Gold Nuggets or Lost Relics.

Most rooms are completely dark, with the exception of light emitted from exits and ceiling gaps during Day and Dusk. Ceiling light is typically above an item surrounded by spike traps or above a room full of Grass Tufts and Saplings. Some rooms contain Wall Braziers that can be fueled like a Fire Pit, but are considered uncontrolled fires like a Campfire, potentially burning nearby flammables.

When being inside any Ancient Pig Ruins, there is no loss of Sanity in darkness.

### Connections to Islands
Entrances located in the Deep Rainforest and Gas Rainforest biomes will have Creeping Vines covering the entrance, which must be destroyed with a Machete or Shears.

The ruins with a Pig statue above the entrance will have a second exit leading to the island with the Palace.

The ruins with an artichoke above the entrance will have a second exit leading to the island with the Fountain of Youth.

The ruins with a Mant statue above the entrance will have a Pherostone located within them.

The ruins with the Ancient Herald statue above the entrance will have a second exit leading to the island with the Aporkalypse Calendar in the ruin located deeper in the island. This ruin is also where the End's Well can be found.

The Palace and Fountain ruin entrances are found in Deep Rainforest biomes on the first island and their respective islands.

The Pherostone and Aporkalypse ruin entrances are found in the Gas Rainforest biome on the first island.

The fifth island (with the Aporkalypse Calendar) has two ruins, both with the Ancient Herald statue. One connects to the first island; while the other contains the End's Well and Aporkalypse Calendar, and is surrounded by several Snaptooth Flytraps in a Set Piece-like fashion.

Many of the doorways within these ruins will also be covered by Creeping Vines, which, unlike the ones on the entrances, regrow upon next entering in the Ruins.

## Pressure Plates
Some rooms have Pressure Plates that, upon being activated by the player, Ghosts, followers (including Abigail), or even Shadow Creatures, do not trigger the Pressure Plates. Upon activating, it will close any surrounding doors besides the exit. One or more of these plates must be weighted down with an item to open the doors. Pressure plates may also

## Description
A Bunnyman is a [Mob] that spawns from a [Rabbit Hutch] in the [Caves]. They usually live in the [Mushtree Forest] [Biome]. Like [Pig]s, Bunnymen will attack any [monster] on sight, such as [Spider]s and [Batilisk]s. These attacks include [Webber] and [Wortox]. When killed, they will drop 2 [Carrot]s and 1 [Meat] (75%) or 1 [Bunny Puff] (25%). Bunnymen will respawn from their Rabbit Hutches after 1 day.

Bunnymen can be befriended by giving them a Carrot (cooked or raw) and will follow the player, the same way Pigs do, for up to 20 minutes or 2.5 game days (Carrot hunger points × 19.2 seconds). For example, feeding 1 Carrot to a Bunnyman will make it a follower for 4 minutes (half a game day). When befriended, Bunnymen will have a [Sanity] aura of 25/min.

Bunnymen will attack the player if any [Meats] or [Eggs] are in the player's inventory, including [Crock Pot] foods unless they are wrapped with bundling wrap. They can sense Meat food items on the player from a range of 8 away. Bunnymen detect monsters inside a radius of 16 'walls', or 4 tiles. A 14 layer thick wall is enough for a Bunnyman to not detect a distant monster.

Bunnymen are attracted by veggies on the floor and will attempt to consume them within in a radius of 10. Some example of veggies are [carrot], [powdercake], [birchnut], and [Glow Berry|glow berry].

Even befriended Bunnymen can become hostile if the player picks up meat. However, Bunnymen won't attack [Chester] ([Hutch] or [Woby] in DST) if he is carrying Meat food items, nor will they attack the player for carrying a [Ham Bat].

Bunnymen regenerate 8.67 Health every 5 seconds.

Bunnymen will flee when they have less than 67 [Health]. Unlike Pigs, they do not fight using a kiting style. Bunnymen will defend each other when attacked. Bunnymen also help fellow bunnymen in attacking; if the player attacks a Bunnyman while allied with other Bunnymen, the player's

The Mast is a craftable Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. It is found in the Seafaring Filter, requires 3 Boards, 3 Ropes and 8 Silk to craft, and a Think Tank to prototype.

The Mast item can be deployed on a Boat. The Mast's sail can then be lowered to allow the players to sail the Boat. A Steering Wheel can be used to direct the Mast's rotation.

Masts can be upgraded with a Deck Illuminator to emit light, or with a Lightning Conductor to protect from Lightning.

To raise the sail efficiently, the player should hover their mouse over the Mast with an open sail and wait for the text to say "Heave!". Clicking on the Mast at this time will have the character raise the Mast halfway. The text will change to "Ho!", and once the player clicks the Mast again, the sail will be closed completely. If the player clicks the Mast before or after these text prompts, the character will struggle and it will take longer to close the sail. This applies to the Winged Sail as well.

## Exclusivity
- Don't Starve, Reign of Giants, Shipwrecked, Hamlet, Don't Starve Together

## Quotes
- Wilson: "I get crazy when I don't sleep."
- Willow: "I got all the badges in Girl Scouts."
- Wolfgang: "It is time for a mighty nap."
- Wendy: "Sleep is but a preview of death."
- WX78: "I CAN REBOOT IN THERE"

## Scrapbook Info
A survivor can use the tent at Dusk or Night.
- Survivor recovers 2 Health per second and 1 Sanity per second but consumes 0.33 Hunger per second.
- It also reduces 1 Wetness per second and increases temperature 1 degree per second up to 40 degrees.

## Tips
- The Tent is unusable by Wickerbottom due to her insomnia.
- Unequipping any items that lose durability while worn before sleeping will save their durability.
- It is most efficient to sleep with low health and sanity and with high hunger to stay asleep longer.
- You should have food prepared to eat when waking up so health isn't lost from starvation.
- Even though Wormwood cannot heal from eating food, the Tent allows him to deal with this restriction by converting Hunger points to Health (and Sanity). Assuming there is an abundant supply of food, Wormwood can repeatedly replenish his health this way in order to farm valuable Living Logs.
- Wearing a Slurper, Belt of Hunger, Hibernation Vest or Funcap or playing as Wolfgang, Wes, or Warly doesn't change the Hunger cost of sleeping in a Tent.
- The Tent is one of the few structures in the game that costs Silk. Having it prebuilt can provide some emergency silk when carrying a Hammer to save inventory space.

## Trivia
- The Tent's original use was to allow the player to change their character. Crafting the tent cost more resources (15 Silk, 6 Twigs, and 3 Ropes), its crafting description was "Change your skin", and the Tent would be destroyed after one use. This functionality was changed in the 2013 "Progress!" update.

## Bugs
- Sometimes after a 100% torch is equipped before sleeping, after the character sleeps the torch will still have a durability of 20%, and it will not lose durability. Unequipping and equipping the torch again will fix the bug.
- Sleeping while taking damage from Freezing may cause the edges of the screen to be stuck red. This will persist until the game is reloaded or if the character starts taking freezing damage again and warms back up.

## Ruined Sculptures

Ruined Sculptures are statues introduced in the Hamlet DLC. They can be found occasionally in the Rainforest and Deep Rainforest biomes, as well as the Ancient Pig Ruins. There are seven different Ruined Sculptures that have different loot, including The Eroding Totem, the Tempting Idol, three types of Crumbling Visages, The Blue Sow and The Jeweled Truffle.

The Blue Sow and The Jewelled Truffle are unique in that they can only be found in special rooms of the Ancient Pig Ruins, which are typically hidden behind Suspicious Cracks.

Mining or chiseling the Ruined Sculptures found within Ancient Pig Ruins may trigger nearby Striking Carvings.

## Scrapbook Info
The Brush can be used on Beefalo to collect Beefalo Wool. Increases Beefalo Obedience by 40% and increases Beefalo domestication by 1.6% once per day.

## Prototype Tips
- The Brush can be used multiple times on the same Beefalo, but will only be beneficial the first time it is used per day. Thus, it should be used once per day on each Beefalo that is being tamed.
- Using a Deconstruction Staff will give back all the materials, enabling the creation of endless brushes with only 1 required Steel Wool.

# Conspicuous Chest

There will be various loot inside the Conspicuous Chest, but it will always have a **Terrarium** that can be used to summon the **Eye of Terror** and **Twins of Terror**. Besides the special loot, it works identical to a **Chest**, and can be hammered down to get **Boards**. Once found, the Conspicuous Chest will display an icon on the **Map**. If it is found with **Pig Torch**es around it the **Guardian Pig**s will turn into **Werepigs** and the Pig Torches will be put out upon opening the chest.

## Bookcase
A **Bookcase** is a Structure added in **Don't Starve Together** and only craftable by **Wickerbottom** in her **Survivor Items Filter**. It requires one **Feather Pencil**, two **Living Logs**, and four **Papyrus** to build. It allows to prototype most of her unique **Books** (with the exception of **Sleepytime Stories** and **The End is Nigh!**). It has twenty slots for storing her Books as well as the **Cookbook** and Papyrus.

It restores the **durability** of her books inside it at a rate of 1% per 30 seconds. The restoration rate is double while a Wickerbottom is within a three turf cell radius of a Bookcase. The additional restoration rate does not stack with more than one Wickerbottom in range.

In addition, the Bookcase is a science station that unlocks **Alchemy Engine** level recipes for all characters.

## Trivia
- The Dewey Decimal System referenced in the item description is a system of library organization.
- During the beta testing of the Wickerbottom Character Update, it was possible to put **Codex Umbra** in a bookcase despite the fact that when looking at the Codex Umbra, Wickerbottom says: "I'm not letting THAT in MY library!". This feature was later removed in beta update 516063.

## Description
Sandy Turf is one of the Turf Items that appears in the Reign of Giants DLC, acquired by digging Desert tiles with a Pitchfork. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as fuel.

Lureplants can be planted on these turfs, but its Eyeplants will be prevented from spawning.

When placed on the Surface World and the area is large enough, Crows are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs.

Farm Plots can be placed on Sandy Turf, so one does not need to worry about not being able to build farms in a desert.

In SW, Floods can spawn on this turf.

## Scrapbook Info
A fireproof container with 12 slots.

## Usage
The Scaled Chest is a craftable container. It requires an Alchemy Engine to prototype, and costs 1 Scale, 4 Boards, and 10 Gold Nuggets to craft. Unlike the regular Chest, the Scaled Chest is fireproof and has 12 slots, as opposed to the normal Chest's 9 slots. Items can be stored in a Scaled Chest by dragging them onto it or by opening the Chest to place them in specific slots. Chests help keep items better organized than by dropping them on the ground. Note that there are four Mobs in the game that can steal from, or knock items out of, chests; Splumonkeys, Krampus, Slurtles, and Bearger.

## Recipe

- **Name**: Tall Scaled Chest
- **Tool to build**: Can be Hammered ![Hammer](Hammer.png)
- **Resources**: ![Boards](Boards.png)
- **Perk**: Can hold up to 12 items. The chest no longer has a stack limit.
- **Spawn Code**: "treasurechest_upgraded"

## Collapsed Scaled Chest
If you destroy a Tall Scaled Chest that contains a large number of items, then instead of all items falling out, a broken version of it will appear in its place, along with some of items. The player can pick on the Collapsed Scaled Chest to get one stack of the items at at time, or you can repair it with the materials of a Scaled Chest plus an Enlightened Shard, in which case the chest will be restored with all the resources inside. When a boat with a Tall Scaled Chest is destroyed, it will only leave some part of the items but no Collapsed Scaled Chest, meaning that the player will lose the rest of items forever.

# Birdcage

The Birdcage is a craftable Structure that allows the domestication of Birds (Redbirds, Crows, Snowbirds, Canaries, etc.). It requires 6 Gold Nuggets, 2 Papyrus, and 2 Seeds to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

## Description

A happy home for your avian friends. A Birdcage can only house one bird; however, it can be easily swapped with another at any time. There is no functional difference between the different types of birds, other than the aesthetic appeal, with the exception of Canaries in the caves when Toadstool is alive and Misshapen Birds and Moonblind Crows.

## Quotes

- Wilson: I should put a bird in it.
- Willow: Bird prison!
- Wolfgang: Is home for birdies.

## Usage

A bird in a Birdcage can be fed uncooked Seeds, uncooked Crop Seeds, uncooked Farm Plant crops, or most Meat-based foods (including Dishes), excluding any eggs and Switcherdoodles, and will produce fresh seeds or Eggs.

- Feeding Seeds or Crop Seeds only has a 33% chance to drop Guano, without dropping any kind of seeds.
- Feeding a Farm Plant yields one item of its corresponding Crop Seed.
- Feeding any meat food yields an Egg.

Misshapen Birds and Moonblind Crows can only produce Rotten Eggs or Rot.

## Tips

- Spoiling food can be saved from turning into Rot or Rotten Eggs by converting them into fresh Eggs.
- The bird can be used to convert meats that are not accepted by the Pig King into Eggs, which are accepted in exchange for Gold Nuggets.
- The Birdcage is good for Winter, when food resources are limited, as the player can feed the bird easy-to-acquire Monster Meat-items to get fresh Eggs in return, which can be eaten or further be used in Crock Pot recipes.

## Trivia

- In older versions of Don't Starve, the Birdcage cost 100 Research Points.
- Initially, only Crows were worth keeping in birdcages because Redbirds would die in Winter and Snowbirds would die in Summer. This was changed soon after.

## Bugs

- If the player removes the bird from the cage but has no available slots, rather than the character holding onto it and remarking that there is no more space, the bird will either disappear or be freed.

# Obsidian Fire Pit

Exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, the **Obsidian Fire Pit** is a version of the normal **Fire Pit** that requires 3 **Logs** and 8 **Obsidian** to craft, and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. It allows **Fuel** to last 3 times as long as a **Campfire** and 1.5 times as long as a **Fire Pit**, while also emitting a massive light radius, making this the most effective and resource-friendly fire. Unlike other fires, the **Obsidian Fire Pit** doesn't set surrounding objects on fire.

## Features
- **Discharge Rate**: Fuel lasts 3 times longer than a normal fire.
- **Light**: Emits a large light radius, making it an excellent light source.
- **Immunity**: Immune to being extinguished by **Strong Winds**.
- **Flooding**: Can be flooded, but at a slower rate than a normal fire pit.
- **Rain**: Burns fuel up to 200% faster in the rain, similar to a **Fire Pit**.
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Two **Charcoal** will be dropped when the fire pit has reached at least 3/4 of the way to maximum fuel.

- **Wilson**: This fire pit is a conductor for even more... fire.
- **Willow**: I could watch it for hours.
- **Wolfgang**: Wolfgang did good job!
- **Wendy**: A flame to keep the horrors at bay.

# Compost Wrap

## Description
The **Compost Wrap** is a character-specific **Item** craftable only by **Wormwood** in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It is found in the **Green Thumb Tab** and requires 5 **Manure**, 2 **Rot**, and 1 **Nitre** (only for **Wormwood**) to craft.

## Usage
The Compost Wrap is used for **Health** restoration, healing 30 **hp** each after a short animation where Wormwood smears a brown substance over his body and face. Like most healing items, it can be used to heal most **Mobs** in the game, excluding **Chester** and most **Monsters**.

## Bugs
* Wormwood will still play the same healing animation when using the Compost Wrap to heal other Mobs.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: Respectfully, I'd rather eat dirt.
- **Willow**: That's disgusting!
- **Wolfgang**: Is very mighty poop.
- **Wendy**: It's poop. Sigh.
- **WX-78**: DISGUSTING

# Kitschy Idols

Kitschy Idols are character-specific items that only **Woodie** is able to craft in the **Magic Filter** and **Survivor Items Filter**. Woodie can then eat them to trigger specific transformations. When eaten, they cost 20 **Hp** and 15 **Sanity**, and restore 18.75 **Hunger**, the same as raw **Monster Meat**.

- **Choose**: Wendy

## Gameplay

The Boomerang is a craftable Ranged Weapon. It requires 1 Boards, 1 Silk, and 1 Charcoal to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

The Boomerang returns to the player after being thrown. The player must catch it by holding down the action key (default Space key) while it is on its way back. If it isn't caught after being thrown, it will hit the player, causing damage and losing twice the durability on return, and the player will have to pick it up from the ground in order to use it again.

## Tips

- The player can have more than one Boomerang out at a time. The action key must be held for each returning Boomerang, however.
- The Boomerang kills Rabbits and Birds in one throw (except for characters who don't hit as hard, such as Wendy and Wes), making it a great tool for gathering Morsels and Feathers. However, nearby Rabbits and Birds will run away after a death, and additionally, killing them raises the player's naughtiness.
- Birds are perhaps more preferable to kill with a Boomerang since Rabbits can still be caught easily with other means such as Traps, and the objects needed to craft items to kill birds are more demanding than Rabbit Traps.
- When playing as Wolfgang, he may do more or less damage depending on his hunger level, or mightiness in DST. He also receives the same damage multiplier from uncaught Boomerangs.
- The Boomerang serves much the same purpose on the console versions of the game, though because of the auto targeting system, it is not a recommended weapon. One must not stand near anything interactive (Grass, Flowers, Flint, etc.) and wait for the Boomerang to be selected on its way back before quickly pressing "X" to catch it. This can be hard to do, and if the player's health is too low, it can easily cause death.
- Because of the low damage, the easy to craft recipe, and durability the Boomerang is most useful at aggroing fast mobs such as Koalefant and Volt Goats or to kill Birds

Dragoon Eggs are the meteors that fall from the sky when a **Volcanic Eruption** occurs during the **Dry Season**, if the **Volcano Staff** is used in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** or if Wickerbottom uses **Joy of Volcanology**.

A direct hit from a Dragoon Egg will deal 300 damage. When they fall into the **Ocean**, they will sink and create big **Waves**. If they make impact on the land, they will destroy **items** and **structures** they hit, and ignite items around the impact point. When hitting the land, they have a 50% chance to create a **Lava Pool**, and 25% chance to stay intact, otherwise they are destroyed.

Intact Dragoon Eggs will hatch into **Dragoon**s after 120 seconds, if they are left alone. They can also be **mined** with a Pickaxe to obtain 1-2 **Flint**, 1-2 **Rocks**, and 1-2 **Obsidian**, which will prevent the egg from hatching.

## Description

The **Carrot Plant** is an object exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the **Reap What You Sow** update. It can be obtained by planting **Oblong Seeds** (also named Carrot Seeds, if researched with the **Gardeneer Hat**) into **Farm Soil** or on the ground as **Wormwood**. There is a chance to grow a Carrot Plant by planting regular **Seeds**.

The plant's favourite seasons are **Autumn**, **Winter**, and **Spring**, so in **Summer** it will grow slower and accumulate more **Stress** points.

When harvesting in the full stage, it will give 1 Carrot and 0-2 Oblong/Carrot Seeds depending on the amount of stress points the plant accumulated. It can also grow to a **Giant Crop**, if the plant accumulated only 0-1 stress points. When picked and **hammered**, it will drop 2-3 Carrots and 2-3 Oblong/Carrot Seeds.

The Carrot stays 4 days on the plant before rotting and the Giant Carrot stays 6 **Days** on the plant. If it has been planted by Wormwood, it lasts 50% longer before spoiling. Picking the plant in its rotten stage will give 1 **Rot** (normal) or 3 Rot and 1 Carrot Seed (giant). After 4 to 5 days of being in the rotten stage, a non-giant Carrot Plant grows back, but the new plant cannot become giant.

When picking up a rotten plant, a **Fruit Fly** has a 5% chance to spawn.

## Description

Sandbags are a craftable Structure in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. They are crafted with 2 Cloth and 3 Sand, yielding 4 Sandbags. Sandbags are used to prevent flooding by barricading tides rising from the shore or filling puddles that appear during Monsoon Season.

Although they count as Walls, unlike other walls, they are allowed to be placed very close to existing structures. Mobs may attack Sandbags if it is in the way to their target. As with any Wall, Sandbags can occasionally be targeted and destroyed by Spiders.

Both Puddles and Tides can be stopped by placing Sandbags in front of them, but if a puddle is not completely surrounded, it can continue to expand in any direction which isn't blocked by a Sandbag. This means that given enough time or a small enough wall, a puddle can seep around a wall of sandbags and overtake it. However, a complete encirclement of sandbags can keep a puddle from getting in or out, allowing you to either contain a puddle in one spot where it starts or keep a small area from being touched. Puddles can also be stopped from expanding by placing a single Sandbag in the exact center, even though this single Sandbag does not block any edges of the puddle. It is not known at this time whether this is a bug or intended functionality. This works for any size of the puddle, as long as the center "eye" is covered with a Sandbag.

Sandbags can be used to absorb puddled areas, creating a dry tile; however, if the "eye" of the puddle is still there after being Hammered, the area will be immediately flooded again.

Hammering a placed Sandbag that is blocking a puddle will cause the puddle to immediately extend. Hammering a Sandbag will drop 2 Sand if it was undamaged, otherwise, it will drop 1 Sand.
