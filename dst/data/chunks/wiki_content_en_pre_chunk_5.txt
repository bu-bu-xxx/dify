## Exclusivity

*Don't Starve Together*

## For

For the boats seen in **[Shipwrecked]** and **[Hamlet]**, see **[Boats]**.

## Description

The **Boat** is a **Float Platform** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It can be created by launching a **Boat Kit** into the **Ocean**.

A Boat starts with 200 health, represented by the icon **Hull**. When the **Hull** reaches 0, the boat sinks, leaving 3 **Boards** and half of the materials used to create all the structures on the boat. All Players **Drowning** and reappear on the nearest coast.

The Boat has one plank, which can be used to abandon ship at any time, suffering the same consequences as drowning.

Being made of wood, the boat itself is flammable and can catch fire (either from placing an open **Campfire** on it, or having the fire spread to other onboard flammable items), causing heavy damage to the boat depending on how many current segments are currently in flames (there are 5 segments total, the center, and 4 on each side). Contained fires, such as a **Firepit** or **Scaled Furnace**, can be safely placed and used on the boat.

In addition to sailing, a boat can be used to bridge together small gaps between land branches. This allows players to speed up their travel at little cost.

## Repair

When damaged, the Boat can be repaired by the following materials. **Trusty Tape** and **Tree Jam** can only be used on Leaks.

| Material | Repair Value |

# Hound Mounds

## Overview
Hound Mounds are naturally spawning objects found in both Sandbox Mode and Adventure Mode, more commonly in the latter. They house up to 3 Hounds which spawn in 5 second intervals until the mound is empty. Hounds that are killed will gradually regenerate at a rate of 1 every 30 seconds.

## Details
- **Image**: ![Hound Mound](File:Hound Mound.png)
- **Health**: 300
- **Resources**:
  - DS: Hound's Tooth ×3, Red Gem 1%, Blue Gem 1%
  - RoG: Hound's Tooth ×3, Red Gem 1%, Blue Gem 1%, Bone Shards ×2
- **Spawns**: Hound, Red Hound, Blue Hound
- **Renew**: No
- **Biome**: DS: Rockyland, Forest; RoG: Desert
- **Spawn Code**: "houndmound"

## Quotes
- Wolfgang: "Is house of bones."
- Wilson: "I've got no bones to pick with the owner. Really."
- Willow: "Uh oh, I don't like the look of that."
- Woody: "I know better than to mess with that."
- Maxwell: "It's a tunnel down to the hounds' nest."
- Wagstaff: "Are there hounds hiding within it?"
- Wendy: "Home to the foulest creatures."
- Woodlegs: "Th'ounds be livin' thar."
- Wickerbottom: "Those bones are foreboding."
- Webber: "This place scares us."
- Warly: "It smells wet."
- WX78: "SOMETHING DANGEROUS RESIDES HERE"
- Walani: "I think there are some angry pups lurking nearby."
- Wigfrid: "These höunds are truly warriörs."
- Wilba: 'TIS HILL O' HOUND
- Wortox: "It's the dog house!"
- Wormwood: "Woofers around?"
- Wurt: "Found doggy nest, florp."
- Wheeler: "Typical. Dogs never clean up after themselves."
- Winona: "So that's where they're comin' from."
- Walter: "I bet there's something interesting hiding in there!"
- Wanda: "Ugh, a dwelling made of old bones!"

## Behavior and Mechanics
- Hound Mounds have 300 health and drop 3 Hound's Teeth with a 1% chance each of dropping a Blue or Red Gem when destroyed.
- When hit, all hounds that are housed in the mound, but have not yet spawned, will spawn and attack the player.
- Special Hound Spawn Chance: 
  | Day       | Special Hound Spawn Chance |
  |----------|---------------------------|
  | 1-14     | 0%                       |
  | 15-29    | 10%                      |
  | 30-49    | 20%                      |
  | 50-74    | 33%                      |
  | 75+      | 50%                      |

## Reign of Giants DLC
- Hound Mounds can be found commonly in the Desert Biome, often in a cluster and near Gold Veins.
- When destroyed, the mounds will drop 2 Bone Shards in addition to their regular loot.
- The mounds now house between 2-3 hounds and have a 20% chance to spawn a Red Hound instead of a regular hound during Summer.
- Hounds now spawn from mounds in 30 second intervals, and hounds that are killed regenerate at a rate of 1 every 2 minutes.

## Tips
- Hounds spawned from Hound Mound will not continue to chase players if they are far away from the mound.
- Players should be careful when trying to lure a Deerclops or a Spider Queen to a Hound Mound, as the Hounds may kill the player before attacking the giants.
- In the Reign of Giants DLC, players can use Hound Mounds to farm Red Gems from the Red Hounds that have a 20% chance of spawning from the mounds during Summer. Blue Gems; however, only spawn from Blue Hounds, which will only have a chance of spawning when the mound is attacked.
- Hound Mounds can be destroyed by the fires spawned by Red Hounds.

## Trivia
- Hound Mounds were added in the "A Little Rain Must Fall" update.
- Hound Mounds will continue to spawn Hounds even if the player is playing on a world with Hounds set to the 'none' amount, as that only controls Hound waves. To avoid encountering Hounds from mounds, the

Players are to be wary around Bones, as they may indicate the presence of **Hound Mounds** nearby, which will spawn numerous aggressive **Hounds**, or the Bones may be part of traps.

## Reign of Giants DLC

In the **[Reign of Giants]** DLC, Bones can be found randomly scattered in the **[Desert]** **[Biome]**. They can also be **[hammer]**ed for **[Bone Shards]**. Type 3 bone piece (skull) has a 50% chance to also drop a **[Hound's Tooth]**.

## Trawl Net Details
The Trawl Net is a [[Boats|Boat]] attachment from the ''[[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]]'' DLC. It is crafted from 3 [[Rope]] and 2 [[Bamboo]] and must be prototyped at the [[Science Machine]]. It is also a reward from the [[Yaarctopus]] in exchange for [[Bisque]]. Trawl Nets cannot be attached to rafts.

The Trawl Net is used for capturing small marine life and items on the water bed. It has 9 storage slots and drops upon being full. It can be detached manually before it is full, but it cannot be attached or retrieved again. The player can click on a detached Trawl Net to open it and retrieve the contents. Detached Trawl Nets cannot be retrieved, and will sink 90 seconds after being detached, dropping any items it contains once it disappears. If the player fails to collect them before the Trawl Net sinks, any living creatures will die and their dead versions will drop instead. Items caught in the Trawl Net will not stack even if they normally would in the inventory.

The Trawl Net is equipped in the same slot on a boat as [[Sails]], forcing the player to paddle the boat. A new item can be caught in the Trawl Net for every 100 units traveled in any direction. Each item caught reduces the player's movement speed by about 2.8%, up to a maximum penalty of about -25% with 9 items caught. Dragging the Trawl Net over a [[Mussel]] spawn will yield a single mussel and consume the spawn. [[Jellyfish]] and [[Wobster]]s can also be caught with the Trawl Net by sailing close by them and catching them in the net. Trawl Nets are the only way to acquire [[Seaweed Plant|Seaweed Stalks]] and Sunken Prefabs. [[Bioluminescence]] can also be collected by the Trawl Net during the [[Dusk]] and the night time. The [[Quacken]] has a chance to spawn every time an item is collected in the deep ocean.

Additionally, items that sunk in the Ocean can be retrieved by sailing over them with an attached Trawl Net. These items will periodically generate bubbles to indicate their location. Items can only be retrieved this way if they didn't sink in the [[Ocean#Shipwrecked|Deep Ocean]], and less than 2 days have passed since they sunk. Items that remain sunk in the ocean after 2 days, are lost forever, and cannot be retrieved. Items sunk in Deep Ocean tiles are immediately lost and cannot be retrieved.

## Loot
The following items can be obtained through the Trawl Net depending on the [[Seasons#Shipwrecked|Season]]:

# Pig Heads

## Object Infobox
![Pig Head](Pig_Head.png) ![Pig Head Full Moon](Pig_Head_Full_Moon.png) ![Pig Head Burnt](Pig_Head_Burnt.png)  
Image width: 80px  
Resources: Twigs x24, Pig Skin x24  
Renew: No  
Tool: Can be Hammered  
Can Be Burned: 1  
Spawn Code: "pighead"  
Sanity Drain: -?/min (only during a Full Moon)

## Quotes
- Wilson: Looks like an offering to the beast.
- Willow: I guess I have it alright.
- Wolfgang: Why long face?
- Wendy: Kill the pig. Spill his blood.
- Wx78: THAT PIG WILL FEEL SILLY WHEN HE NOTICES HE HAS LOST HIS HEAD MODULE
- Wickerbottom: Tut tut. It's a head on a stick.
- Woody: What a waste of good pork.
- Maxwell: Er... charming.
- Wigfrid: This is savagery.
- Webber: We just wanted to be friends.

## Description
Pig Heads are decorative structures usually found around Touch Stones, Rundown Houses, and Merm villages. They are the severed heads of Pigs on sticks, similar to Merm Heads, the latter being often found in Pig Villages. Destroying a Pig Head with a Hammer drops 2 Pig Skin and 2 Twigs. This is a good way to get Pig Skin early in the game. Deconstructing a Pig Head with a Deconstruction Staff drops 4 Pig Skin and 4 Twigs, although it cannot be constructed.

In all DLCs during a Full Moon, the Pig Head's eyes will open and become pure white, similar to a Catcoon or Buzzard's eyes. Destroying a Pig Head during this time yields Nightmare Fuel, while deconstructing it yields 2. A burnt Pig Head will still drop 2 Pig Skin and 2 Twigs when destroyed by a Hammer.

## Trivia
- Pig Heads were added in the Doorway to Adventure update.
- Pig Heads can be found around the Merm camps, and Merm Heads can be found around the Pig Villages. This suggests that there is a war between Pigs and Merms, or at least hostility.
- The way the Pig Heads glow during a Full Moon looks similar to the way they were shown to glow when using a Touch Stone in one of the update trailers.
- Wilson's and Wendy's quotes are both direct references to the novel Lord of the Flies by William Golding.
- Initially, there was only one pig's head next to the Touch Stone. At the same time, it glowed only after activating the Touch Stone.
- You can see that there are black tears coming from the pig's head.

## Structure Infobox

- **Name:** Mandrake
- **Picked:** Can be picked

- **Dropped By:** ![Planted Mandrake](Planted Mandrake.png) Mandrake
- **Drops:** ![Mandrake](Mandrake.png)
- **Spawn Code:** "mandrake_active" "mandrake_planted"
- **Special Ability:** Follows the player when picked at dusk/night.

## Quotes

- **Wilson:** I've heard strange things about those plants.
- **Willow:** That's not a normal plant.
- **Wolfgang:** Is strange plant.
- **Wendy:** The mighty mandrake. I should pick it at night.
- **WX-78:** IT IS A PLANT
- **Wickerbottom:** Mandragora officinarum.
- **Woodie:** It's looking at me.
- **Maxwell:** What a disturbing root.
- **Wagstaff:** The appearance of that root raises my curiosity.
- **Wigfrid:** A rutabaga!
- **Webber:** That's a funny looking plant.

When picked during the Day, it will die instantly and can be obtained as an item. Mandrakes cannot be grown and therefore there is a limited number of them in a world.

With normal damage modifiers, it takes one hit from a Spear to kill a Mandrake (any version of an Axe or Pickaxe will do the same).

## Description

The **Chiminea** is a Structure in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC, which works just like the Firepit. It provides light and heat, allows food to be cooked, and doesn't set surrounding objects on Fire (unlike the Campfire). It requires 2 Limestone, 2 Sand, and 2 Logs to be crafted, and it is available from the beginning of the game without any stations.

The Chiminea is essential during the Hurricane Season, since Campfires and Firepits are extinguished much faster by Strong Winds and Rain. It is also immune to Tides and Flooding during Monsoon Season, meaning the fire will not immediately extinguish itself if there is flooding below the Chiminea.

The Ice Flingomatic can still extinguish the Chiminea if within range. The structure itself cannot be burned or catch fire. One Charcoal will be dropped by a Chiminea that has reached at least 3/4 of the way to maximum fuel (or 3 logs) when it goes out.

## Tips

While the Chiminea does not require a Science Machine to build, two of the ingredients, Limestone and Sand, are difficult to obtain without one (or otherwise having access to the required recipes through Wickerbottom).

# Tuber

## Exclusivity
- **Hamlet**

## Structure Infobox
- **Food Type:** Veggie
- **Can Be Burned:** 1
- **Icon:** Tuber.png
- **Image:** Tuber Dropped.png
- **HP Restored:** 10
- **Hunger Restored:** 12.5
- **Sanity Restored:** 0
- **Spoil:** 20 Days
- **Stack:** 10
- **Dropped By:** Tuber Tree
- **Spawn Code:** tuber_crop

## Quotes
- Wilson: Too bad tuber.
- Willow: Should be ripe before I burn it.
- Wolfgang: Is food?
- Wendy: Will I be dead before it ripens?
- WX-78: STILL LOADING...
- Wickerbottom: It's rather poisonous when it's not ripe.
- Woodie: Better not eat it until it's ripe.
- Maxwell: Looks unripe.
- Wagstaff: Given my delicate constitution, I'll refrain from eating it raw.
- Wigfrid: 'Tis unripe nön-meat.
- Webber: I don't think it's ripe yet.
- Walani: Doesn't look like it's ripe.
- Warly: Ah. It is not ripe yet.
- Woodlegs: Give ya a bout of scury that.
- Wilba: TUBER, OR NAUGHT TUBER
- Wormwood: Not ready
- Wheeler: How adventurous am I feeling?

## Usage
- Tuber can be cooked to make Fried Tuber.
- Tuber can be combined with Flytrap Stalk and processed at the Science Machine to make Bug B'Gone.

## Tips
- WX-78 is able to eat unripe Tubers as they are not affected by Poison.
- Since Pigs will eat any food left on the ground, one can drop an unripe Tuber near a Pig Guard, poisoning it and making it easier to kill it.
- As Blooming Tubers are only abundant during the Lush Season they allow one to easily stockpile food using Bundling Wraps.
- The Mud Spa sells Anti-venom for 5 Oincs, making this a potentially good method of healing in specific occasions if the Mud Spa has been located.

### Description
Shears are a tool exclusive to the **Hamlet** DLC. They can be crafted in the **Tools Tab** using 2 **Twigs** and 2 **Iron Ore**. They can be used to trim a variety of things, including:
- **Tall Grass**, giving two **Cut Grass**
- **Hedge**s, giving two **Clippings**
- **Hanging Vine**, giving a **Rope**
- **Creeping Vine**, 3 clips to open a ruin and 2 clips each to open doors inside
- **Nasty Spear Trap**s, destroying it

The main benefits of Shears are the increased yield and decreased harvesting time when used compared to a **Machete** and **Razor**.

Shears are more effective than its counterparts:
- **Tallgrass** - Shears clip once and give two cut grass, a machete strikes 3 times for 1 cut grass.
- **Hedges** - Shears give two clippings, a razor gives one clipping but the razor has infinite durability.
- **Creeping vines** - Shears clip 3 times for outside vines and 2 times for inside vines, a machete strikes 12 times for outside vines and 4 times for inside vines.

The materials for crafting shears are renewable. The shears are also obtainable from trawling in the **Lily Ponds** with a small chance (1.96%).

### Shipwrecked
If bought from a connected Hamlet world, they can be used to shear things including:
- **Bamboo Patch**, giving two **Bamboo**
- **Viney Bush**, giving two **Vine**

A Gold Nugget is a mineral in Don't Starve. It is a required item for many Crafting recipes.

Gold Nuggets can be found by mining Boulders (with gold veins on their side) or Stalagmites (found only in Caves). They can be found lying on the ground in Graveyards or Rocky biomes, and fall from the ceiling in Caves during Earthquakes. The Pig King will also exchange Gold Nuggets for certain items. As some of the aforementioned items exchangeable for Gold Nuggets are renewable, this makes it a fully renewable resource.

Like most other minerals, Gold Nuggets can be eaten by Slurtles and Snurtles, and Slurtles will attack a player carrying it if there aren't any other minerals in the immediate area.

### Downloadable Content

In the Shipwrecked DLC, Gold Nuggets can be Refined from Dubloons. Digging gold flecked Magma Piles can yield Gold Nuggets. Unlike gold veined Boulders, gold flecked Magma Piles do not have a preset amount of Gold Nuggets to drop. Instead, there is an independent 25% chance for each dug up item to be a Gold Nugget. Therefore, there is a small (~7.5%) chance to get no Gold Nuggets, and a very small (~0.00038%) chance to get a total 9 of them from each Magma Pile. Very rarely, Gold Nuggets can be found laying around in Jungle and Magma Field biomes.

This DLC also introduces many new methods to obtain items, most of them include Gold Nuggets as a possible reward, however, typically chance of getting a Gold Nugget among all possible rewards is small and some of these are chance encounters, therefore these cannot be used as a reliable method to obtain Gold Nuggets. These methods include:

# Drying Rack

The **Drying Rack** is a craftable **Food Tab** **Structure**. It requires 3 **Twigs**, 2 **Charcoal**, and 3 **Rope** to craft and a **Science Machine** to prototype.

## Description
The Drying Rack can dry most **Meats** and most **Fishes** into **Jerky**, **Small Jerky**, or **Monster Jerky**. Dried food items take significantly longer to spoil and often provide better **Health** and **Sanity** compared to raw food used in the rack or their cooked versions. In **Don't Starve**, **Meat**, **Monster Meat**, **Morsel**, **Frog Legs**, **Fish**, **Eel**, **Drumstick**, and **Batilisk Wing** can all be dried on the Drying Rack if they are uncooked.

Unlike the results of **Cooking**, the dried food created will always be completely fresh. This means a spoiled Morsel can be dried to get a completely fresh piece of **Small Jerky**. Dried food left on a Drying Rack does not spoil until collected.

## Crafting Recipe
- Ingredient 1: Twigs (Multiplier: 3)
- Ingredient 2: Charcoal (Multiplier: 2)
- Ingredient 3: Rope (Multiplier: 3)

## Exclusivity
**Don't Starve**, **Reign of Giants**, **Shipwrecked**, **Hamlet**, **Don't Starve Together**

## Quotes
- Wilson: "I should dry some meats."
- Willow: "I want to hang some meat!"
- Wolfgang: "I can dry meat!"
- Wendy: "I can hang meat here."
- WX-78: "I SHOULD HANG EXPIRED MEATSACKS HERE"
- Wickerbottom: "Meats can be dehydrated."
- Woodie: "It's set up... just add meat."
- Maxwell: "It can dry meats so that they last longer."
- Wagstaff: "Not the most sophisticated tool but it will do."
- Wigfrid: "Ah! A dangly rack för my meats"
- Webber: "It's not doing us much good empty!"
- Walani: "This rack could use some meat."
- Warly: "Just like the chefs of the stone age!"
- Woodlegs: "Hangin' spot fer me meats."
- Wilba: "‘TIS FOR THE DRYING OF YON MEATS"
- Wormwood: "Takes out wet"
- Wheeler: "Dried food is all I ever eat on long balloon trips."
- Winona: "A rack for drying meat."
- Wortox: "I don't have much use for this."
- Wurt: "Scale-less use this for making yucky foods."
- Walter: "We should make some jerky!"
- Wanda: "A horribly time consuming way to make meat last longer."

## Downloadable Content
In all **DLC**s (including DST), dried food left on the Drying Rack will spoil over time. **Rain** will prevent any items on the Drying Rack from drying, making it less effective in **Spring** in **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** (and the derived DST), **Hurricane Season** and **Monsoon Season** in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**, and **Humid Season** in **Don't Starve: Hamlet**.

## Tips
- Drying Racks are very useful for storing Meats. Jerky and Small Jerky take 20 days to completely spoil, while Meat and Morsel will spoil in 6 days, and cooked Meat/Morsel will spoil in 10 days. Storing any kind of jerky in the **Ice Box** will give 40 days before they spoil, allowing the player to focus on concerns other than gathering fresh food.
- It is a good idea to build some racks early on (i.e. before the first Winter). The player may then store meat on the Drying Racks ready for the Winter, which will easily last throughout Winter once picked. Additionally, the **Jerky** versions provide improved stats over regular and cooked Meats.

## Trivia
- Even though the **Koalefant Trunk** counts as meat, it cannot be hung on the Drying Rack.
- The Hermit Drying Rack was introduced to **Don't Starve Together** in the **She Sells Sea Shells** update.

## Bugs
- In **Reign of Giants**, Jerky left on the Drying Racks in the **Caves** may not continue to spoil while the player is in the surface world

# Lucy the Axe

**Equipment Slot:** Hands  
**Icon:** Lucy the Axe.png  
**Image:** Lucy the Axe Dropped.png  
**Damage:** 13.6  
**Durability:** Infinite ([[Tools#Chopping_Tools|Chopping]])  
**Stack:** Does not stack  
**Perk:** Infinite durability. Reduces chops required to chop a tree by half. [[#Quotes|Gives friendly advice]].  
**Spawn Code:** "lucy"

> "All work and no play makes me want to chop some trees."  
> *- Lucy the Axe*

**Lucy the Axe** is a character-specific item that **Woodie** begins the game with. Lucy has infinite durability and increased effectiveness (one swing at a tree is worth two "chops" of a regular axe), and in Woodie's hands, who has a faster innate chopping animation, cuts **Trees** extraordinarily fast. Lucy is a sentient being, and although it's not known if this is real or just Woodie's imagination, this is likely the former, as in DST, others can see her quotes. When equipped, Lucy will speak a line such as 'I missed you', 'Did you miss me?', and 'You came back!'.

Lucy will encourage Woodie when he chops down Trees, until he has almost reached the point at which he will become a Werebeaver. When the transformation is almost ready to occur, Lucy will begin to warn Woodie.

Lucy can be used as a melee weapon, dealing half the damage of regular [[axes]].

Lucy cannot be stolen by [[Krampus]], [[Splumonkey]]s, and [[Prime Ape]]s or eaten by [[Eyeplant]]s; although she can be destroyed if Woodie tries to attack the [[Nightmare Throne]] with her equipped.

When playing Adventure Mode, Lucy will not use a slot in the Teleportato. She will appear in Woodie's inventory after arriving in the new world.

# Glommer's Statue

![Glommer's Statue](Glommer's Statue.png)

**Glommer's Statue** is a unique structure that appears in the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC. It spawns in the **Deciduous Forest** biome. When mined, it drops three marbles and the **Old Bell** blueprint. Mining the statue does not completely destroy it.

## Spawning and Renewal
- **Spawns**: In **Deciduous Forest**
- **Tool**: Can be **Mined** with a **Pickaxe**
- **Renew**: Cannot be destroyed
- **Spawn Code**: `statueglommer`

## Interactions
- **Biome**: **Deciduous Forest**
- **Picked**: Can be picked (Glommer's Flower) during **Full Moon**
- **Resources**: 
  - Marble ×3
  - Blueprint for Old Bell

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: I'm not sure what that's supposed to be.
- **Willow**: Is that supposed to be something?
- **Wolfgang**: Why statue is not flying?
- **Wendy**: What IS that?!
- **WX-78**: STONE INSECT
- **Wickerbottom**: Is it petrified?
- **Woodie**: That's a curious statue, eh?
- **Maxwell**: Hey, that's not a statue of me!
- **DST: Maxwell**: Thank goodness, I thought it was another wretched statue of me.

## Mechanics
On a **Full Moon**, a **Glommer's Flower** will spawn at the base of Glommer's Statue (even if it has been mined). Picking up Glommer's Flower will trigger **Glommer** to become a permanent "follower" (until Glommer dies). After mining the statue, the base will remain, allowing Glommer and Glommer's Flower to respawn at a full moon. The statue has a 75% chance to spawn near a **Pan Flute**.

Glommer's Flower can only be picked once per full moon, on either night. If a player picks it on the first night of the full moon, and then Glommer dies before the following night, they cannot pick it again the second night - they must wait until the next full moon. If a player picked the flower the **previous** full moon and Glommer dies on either day, the flower can still be picked that night.

There seems to be a high chance that Glommer's Statue will spawn next to a **Pig King** village, which might make collecting Glommer's Flower difficult due to **Werepigs**.

## Crafting and Usage
The Whirly Fan requires 3 Twigs and 1 Petals to craft. It grants low protection from overheating while spinning. It will spin only while the player is running, causing the Whirly Fan to spin and cool down the player. The Whirly Fan has a durability of 1 minute and 30 seconds, and the durability will only decrease while it is spinning. However, it should be noted that the durability will decrease by 1% when being equipped after the first time, which may be a bug.

## Maximum Health Lowered
![Health lowered](File:Health lowered.png|thumb) Maximum health lowered to 120, then 90.

The **Meat Effigy** is an effigy of **Wilson** which resurrects the player on **Death**. It is one of the three ways to be resurrected in the base game (the other two are wearing a **Life Giving Amulet**, or activating a **Touch Stone** before death). A Meat Effigy requires 4 **Boards**, 4 **Beard Hairs**, 4 **Meat**, and 30 maximum health to craft and a **Prestihatitator** to prototype.

### Usage
Every Meat Effigy constructed lowers maximum **Health** by 30 points, which can only be restored if the Meat Effigy is destroyed or used for revival. Building up to 5 Meat Effigies will lower most characters' (all except for a mighty **Wolfgang**, an upgraded **WX-78**, **Webber** and **Wigfrid**, who are still killed by making more) **Health** to 0 and kill them, after which they will be revived and restored to 30 health.

As long as there is a Meat Effigy standing somewhere in the world, the character will be revived at the **nearest** Meat Effigy. However, if a **Touch Stone** is closer than the Meat Effigy they will be resurrected at the Touch Stone instead. After death and resurrection, the Meat Effigy used will be destroyed. Alternatively, it can be destroyed using the **Hammer** or **Deconstruction Staff** which will return the lost 30 health.

An **Ancient Pseudoscience Station** can spawn Effigies when hammered. The health penalty of Effigies produced this way do not take effect until the character has died and been resurrected.

#### Resurrection Penalties
- **Health** is set to 50
- **Hunger** is set to 2/3 of maximum
- **Sanity** is set to 1/2 of maximum

### Tips
- The ability to build Meat Effigies easily is **Wilson**'s greatest advantage over the other characters because he is a walking renewable source of Beard Hair, which is the Meat Effigy's rarest ingredient. However, note that Wilson will have no beard after resurrection.
- Beard hair can also be obtained by catching rabbits and lowering sanity, turning them into **beardlings**.

# Rabbit Hutches

Rabbit Hutches are craftable **Structures** that spawn naturally in the **Caves**. They can spawn individually, in small randomly spaced groups, or in a large circle around a patch of grass and a **Pitchfork**.

## Crafting Recipe
- **Boards**: 4
- **Carrots**: 10
- **Bunny Puffs**: 4

Rabbit Hutches require an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. They will spawn one **Bunnyman**, which will respawn from the hutch after 1 day if killed.

## Behavior
The characteristics of a Rabbit Hutch are similar to that of a **Pig House**, except that it spawns a Bunnyman after a day instead of a **Pig** after four days. In the overworld, Bunnymen will only come out of their houses at dusk. They go home during the day, so having Pig Houses and Rabbit Hutches close to each other is not a problem unless there is a **Full Moon** and the Pigs become Werepigs.

## Farming
A player can farm Bunnymen using **Houndius Shootius** and **Walls**. First, the player must build a Houndius Shootius and then build Rabbit Hutches to surround it. Next, they should build some walls around the Houndius Shootius and around the Rabbit Hutches to prevent the Bunnymen from attacking and to lower the distance the Bunnymen can run away. If the player wishes to use the farm, they should stay around until Dusk or Night and command the Houndius Shootius to shoot the Bunnymen. If done right, this will result in lots of carrots, some meat, and some bunny puffs.

* If the player is Winona, then they can use Winona's Catapults instead of Houndius Shootius.

If there is a group of Bunnymen (at least 3), one can befriend a Bunnyman using a Carrot. Then the player can attack one of the other Bunnymen, canceling the attack before it is completed. This will result in the said Bunnyman being targeted by all other Bunnymen, even if the other Bunnymen have not been befriended. Sometimes, this may result in a chain reaction, making the Bunnymen die as soon as they kill, eventually going on until only a few are left.

## Tips
- If the player decides to build Rabbit Hutches, it is recommended to place them a decent distance away from the camp so that if the player is carrying meat items, a wandering Bunnyman will be too far to notice to become aggressive.
- Both **Spiders** and Bunnymen come out during dusk, so a few Hutches placed together with a **Spider Den** creates a Spider farm. Since Bunnymen are vegetarians, they will not eat the **Monster Meat** dropped by the Spiders, unlike Pigs. The player can just walk by in the morning, or every few days, to collect the loot. **Walling** in the area is ideal to ensure the two parties do not wander off from each other, and it prevents other monsters from coming into the area and stealing the loot.

A **Chest** is a storage **Structure**. It requires 3 **Boards** to build and a **Science Machine** to prototype. It has 9 storage slots. **Items** can be stored in a Chest by dragging them onto it or by opening the Chest to place them in specific slots. Chests help keep items better organized than by dropping them on the ground. **Animals** also cannot eat **Food** kept in Chests except for **Splumonkey**s, who can knock items out of them as well as **Bearger**. Also, **Krampus** is able to break Chests in order to steal the items inside.

**Backpacks**, **Piggyback**s, and **Krampus Sack**s cannot be stored in Chests, even if the containers are empty. However, they can be used as an alternative storage space if for some reason the player is unable to craft a Chest.

In both **Sandbox Mode** and **Adventure Mode**, Chests are occasionally found pre-built in the **world**. These are natural **Set Pieces** and they may contain traps set by **Maxwell**, causing various effects such as:
- Spontaneous **Fire** (character and surrounding objects burst into flames).
- **Summer** or **Winter** suddenly occurs.
- All food in the player's inventory immediately **Rot**.

## Downloadable Content
In **Reign of Giants**, during **Summer**, Chests, as with many structures, can spontaneously combust. A smoking effect will appear, in which time the player must either extinguish the smouldering. Using one's hands causes damage. If this is not done in time, the object will combust and burn. The alternative way to solve this is by using a **Scaled Chest**.

As with **Backpacks**, an **Insulated Pack** cannot be placed in a Chest.

In **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**, **Thatch Packs**, **Sea Sacks**, **Booty Bags**, and **Warly**'s **Chef Pouch** cannot be placed inside a Chest.

In **Hamlet**, **Pog**s can open Chests and empty them by taking all of the items stored. If they find any **food** in them, they will eat it. Like other **Backpacks**, the **Vortex Cloak

## Description
A **Pig Torch** is a naturally occurring **Structure** found in a **Pig Fortress** or near the **Pig King** in **Adventure Mode** and **Survival Mode**. Pig Torches are protected by **Guardian Pigs**. If a Guardian Pig has been killed, the Pig Torch will respawn another Guardian Pig off-screen after 4 **days**. Guardian Pigs will occasionally refuel the Pig Torch, making the light brighter. A Pig Torch will eventually burn out if there are no Guardian Pigs left to refuel it. Other Guardian Pigs will not refuel a Pig Torch that is not their own.

### Crafting and Destruction
The Pig Torch cannot be crafted but can be destroyed using a **Hammer** or **Gunpowder**. **Deerclops** is able to destroy a Pig Torch and **Woodie** can destroy it in Werebeaver form. A Pig Torch will drop 3 **Logs** and 1 **Manure** upon destruction.

### Set Pieces
Pig Torches can be found with certain **Set Pieces**, including a square patch of **Grass** with Pig Torches at the corners and a **Maxwell Statue** guarded by two rows of Pig Torches.

### Light and Heat
Pig Torches emit light but no heat, similar to **Night Lights**.

## Prototype Tips
- Guardian Pigs near Pig Torches transform into **Werepigs** during a **Full Moon**.
- Guardian Pigs near Pig Torches may help fight against hostile enemies, such as a **Spider Queen** or **Deerclops**. However, Deerclops can easily destroy Pig Torches.
- The player can kill a Guardian Pig, then build **Walls** around its corresponding Pig Torch. When the Guardian Pig respawns, it will constantly refuel the Pig Torch (providing infinite light), and won't be able to attack the player due to the walls. Note that during a full moon, Guardian Pigs transform into Werepigs and will attack walls, eventually destroying them. Placing a food item nearby will distract the Werepigs, keeping the walls safe. Another way of keeping the walls safe is to simply go somewhere else during a full moon.
- **Haunting** a Pig Torch in **Don't Starve Together** will cause a Guardian Pig to spawn if there isn't a Guardian Pig currently using the torch.

## Trivia
- Pig Torches were added in the **A Little Rain Must Fall** update.
- Pig Torches resemble (and are likely inspired by

# Sunken Boat

![Sunken Boat Image](File:Wolly-2.png)

The **Sunken Boat** is a structure that can be found next to the Ocean in Don't Starve's Reign of Giants DLC. Flotsam can be found in the nearby water, and a parrot named Wolly sits atop the boat. The Flotsam can be snagged with a Fishing Rod to collect various resources and trinkets.

## Usage

Wolly will accept a Trinket or any raw/cooked meat as a gift, and give a Crimson Feather as well as a random number of either Flint, Gold Nuggets, or Dark Petals. Wolly will not accept raw or cooked Monster Meat, but will accept Monster Jerky. When given specific trinkets found in Flotsam, Wolly will tell a piece from one of Wolly's Riddles in addition to dropping loot. After trading, Wolly will fly away from the Sunken Boat and return after one game day. His return depends on the proximity of the player. If Wolly flew away and has not returned, spending a day or two a few screens away from the Sunken Boat will cause him to return. Wolly cannot be found during winter. He will leave the boat and return when spring/summer starts.

A Sunken Boat can be destroyed with four hits of a Hammer and will drop three Gold Nuggets, three Boards, a Blue Gem, a Red Gem, and a Sea Worther. Wolly will fly away from the boat if it is struck with a Hammer. Since the Sunken Boat does not respawn, destroying it removes the option to trade with Wolly and should only be done as a last resort if attempts to fish the Sea Worther from Flotsam are unsuccessful.

## Quotes

- Wilson: That fellow looks like he wants to talk.
- Willow: That mangy bird looks like he wants my stuff!
- Wolfgang: Pretty birdie come from sea!
- Wendy: Another voyage comes to an end.
- WX78: ANNOYING BIRD WON'T STOP COMMUNICATING
- Wickerbottom: A marooned psittacine with a lugubrious look in his eye.
- Woody: This fellow's not from these parts.
- Maxwell: This bird's vessel is clearly not seaworthy.
- Wagstaff: What a curious parrot! I wonder if he'll speak with me.
- Wigfrid: He has sömething tö say!
- Webber: It's not much to look at.
- Walani: Surfboards don't sink!
- Warly: Hey fella, need a wing?
- Woodlegs: I'd throw ye a line if me had one.
- Wilba: IS'T NAUGHT FLOATY NAY MORE
- Wormwood: Wood is drowning!
- Wheeler: Is that your boat, bird?

## Trivia

- The Sunken Boat was added in the July 30, 2015 update, and accompanied Klei's [official announcement](https://www.kleientertainment.com/games/dont-starve/shipwrecked) of the Shipwrecked DLC, to be released in Fall 2015.
- Wolly resembles a red-and-green macaw.
- The name "Wolly" is a reference to the trope of naming a parrot Polly, with the typical Don't Starve naming convention of W. It's also a homophone of the male name "Wally".
- The Sunken Boat started dropping the Sea Worther when hammered after the Wilbur Vs. the Volcano DLC update. It's used to craft the Seaworthy in linked vanilla or Reign of Giants DLC and Shipwrecked games.
- Wolly speaks in white text for his regular quotes, and in red text for pieces of Wolly's Riddle.

### Description

'''Monkeytails''' are harvestable [[Plants]] exclusive to ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' introduced in ''[[The Curse of Moon Quay]]'' update. They can be found growing natively on [[Moon Quay]]. When harvested, they produce 1 [[Cut Reeds]]. The plant can be harvested again after three days.

Unlike [[Reeds]], they can be dug up with a shovel and transplanted to another place. The transplanted bush can be harvested 5-7 times before it must be [[fertilizer|fertilized]] to grow again. There is a small chance to receive new Monkeytails in their item form from the [[Unnatural Portal]].

Monkeytails can also be used as [[fuel]].

## Description
The Lunar Funcap is a craftable item exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in the From Beyond updates. It can be crafted at the Celestial Orb or Celestial Altar with 4 Moon Shrooms and 1 Red Funcap.

The Lunar Funcap can be equipped in the head slot. When worn, it provides 20% Wetness resistance and 60 points of protection from Overheating. They also periodically spawn Lunar Spores, which will damage nearby mobs. You will also spawn a series of spores when you get hit. The spores you compare do not provoke creatures after the explosion. Wearing the Lunar Funcap grants immunity to the damage of the Spores. Like Garlands, they perish over time whether they are worn or not. They take 6 Days to completely spoil and can be worn for a total of 4 days.

Perishable items stored within the player's inventory while the Lunar Funcap is equipped will spoil 50% faster, this also applies to equipped items, including the Funcap itself. Items stored within Backpacks remain unaffected.

## Trivia
* The Lunar Funcap was introduced in the Scrappy Scavengers update.

# Mermhouse

## Overview
A **Mermhouse** is a naturally occurring **Structure** found in a **Marsh** biome. Its main purpose is spawning and housing **Merm**s. It has an appearance similar to that of a **Pig House**, but in a dilapidated state. It cannot be crafted by the player, making it **non-renewable**. Mermhouses can hold up to four Merms and spawn a Merm every four days if any Merms are killed. Normally, only one Merm per Mermhouse is outside during the day. If that Merm gets into combat or if the house is struck with a **Hammer**, the rest of the Merms will come out and help it fight. Also, when **Dusk** comes, all Merms exit their house to wander around in the vicinity.

## Resources
- **Deconstructing a Mermhouse with a Hammer** yields 1-2 **Rocks**, 1 **Board**, and 1 **Fish**.

## Downloadable Content
In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, Mermhouses are replaced by **Merm Huts** in **Tidal Marshes**. Merm Huts have a more tropical and better maintained appearance compared to Rundown Houses. When destroyed, instead of Fish, they drop **Tropical Fish**. Otherwise, their behavior is identical.

## Trivia
- Before the release of **Don't Starve: Hamlet**, Mermhouses were called Rundown Houses.

# Rock Den

Exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, the **Rock Den** is a naturally spawning object introduced in **A New Reign**. It is a small cave with two eyes looking out and is frequently found in the **Mosaic** Biome.

## Properties
- **Perk**: Unlocks the **Critters Filter**.
- **Renew**: Cannot be destroyed.
- **Image**: ![Rock Den](Rock Den.png)
- **Biome**: Mosaic
- **Spawn Code**: "critterlab"

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Is there something in there?"
- Willow: "Is there anything cute in there??"
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang hear little noises inside."
- Wendy: "Oh. The abyss is staring back at me..."
- WX78: "IT'S A MINION HOLE"
- Wickerbottom: "A perfect hollow for nesting animals."
- Woodie: "Anyone home?"
- Maxwell: "Am I being watched by that rock?"
- Wigfrid: "Tis a peculiar böulder."
- Webber: "It looks warm in there."
- Winona: "Come on out, don't be shy."
- Warly: "I could use a friend in this difficult world."
- Wortox: "Ooo, I'd like a partner in pranks."
- Wormwood: "Little friends hiding inside"
- Wurt: "See something moving inside, florp."
- Walter: "What's wrong Woby? Is something in there?"
- Wanda: "Shadow creatures! No, wait a tick, it's something else..."
- Choose: WX78

## Description
The **Rock Den** works similar to crafting stations like **Ancient Pseudoscience Stations**, unlocking the **Critters Filter** and allowing players to adopt various **Critters** such as Kittykits, Varglings, Ewelets, Broodlings, Glomgloms and Giblets. These pets will follow the player and avoid combat. Each player is only allowed to keep one pet at a time, so trying to adopt another one will not work unless the player chooses to abandon the previous one. This can also be done standing close to the Rock Den. **Walter** already has **Woby** and cannot use the Rock Den.

The **Rock Den** itself is not flammable and cannot be destroyed by any means.

## Trivia
- The **Rock Den** was introduced in the **Cute Fuzzy Animals** update on November 3, 2016.
