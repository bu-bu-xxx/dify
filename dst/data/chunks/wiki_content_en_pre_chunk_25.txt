It requires a **Science Machine** to prototype and is crafted using 1 **Empty Bottle**, 1 **Pig Skin**, and 1 **Gold Nugget**. It is also a reward from the **Yaarctopus** in exchange for **Ceviche**.

When equipped, it can be peered through to reveal a cone-shaped portion of the map in the direction the player clicks with Right Mouse Button (RMB).

The range Spyglass will reveal changes by the time of **Day-Night Cycle**, farthest being during day time. The range is also reduced on boats, and during **Hurricane Season**.

## Usage
### Hand
- **Item**: Crow
- **Result**: Morsel
- **Or**
- **Result2**: Jet Feather

### Fire
- **Item**: Crow
- **Fire**: yes
- **Result**: Cooked Morsel

## Hunting
Crows can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one. They can be killed by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Jet Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel. Birds in the player's inventory can be dropped on the ground and will flop on the ground belly-up for a short while before flying off. They can also be imprisoned in Bird Cages.

Hunting Birds requires a ranged weapon such as a Boomerang. Birds will not land within melee range (even if bait is placed on the ground) and will fly away when the player approaches. However, if they are put to sleep when using characters with a normal damage modifier, they can be killed in 1 hit with a sufficient melee weapon.

If a bird is in flight while in range of a sleeping item's effect, it will plummet to the ground and can be picked up as an item.

Wearing a Feather Hat will increase the number of Birds spawning as well as decreasing the time between spawns. Using Birds of the World (while playing as Wickerbottom) will also cause a large number of them to land.

One can send a Smallbird to attack a Bird. This can be done without the bird getting frightened and without raising naughtiness.

They take one blast from the Ice Staff to be frozen and one Sleep Dart to be put to sleep.

## Tips
- When bait-trapping Birds for their Feathers, players should make sure to do so on Turf in which specific Birds will spawn, so that they get specific Feathers. Redbirds and Snowbirds spawn most commonly on Grass Turf, while Crows spawn on Rocky Turf and all player-made turfs.
- If one can manage to bring a Damaged Bishop from the Ruins, their ranged blasts are an effective tool to hunt birds without expending resources on Bird Traps or Boomerangs.
- If the player doesn't want any Feathers from the Birds, cooking them alive provides a guaranteed Cooked Morsel. Note that this means sacrificing the option of turning the Bird into Small Jerky, since cooked meat cannot be hung on a Drying Rack.

# Wildbore Heads
Wildbore Heads are decorative structures found in the *Don't Starve: Shipwrecked* DLC, as a replacement of Pig Heads. Wildbore Heads are heads of Wildbores placed on bamboo poles, and hammering them yields one Bamboo and one Pig Skin.

During a Full Moon, the eyes will open and glow pure white. In this state, they will drop one Nightmare Fuel (along with the normal loot) when hammered. They can only be found around Touch Stones.

**Skeletons** are the remains of other unknown adventurers who perished before the main character entered the world. They can occasionally be found in the wilderness, usually around Set Pieces, and often have random loot beside them. Skeletons can be struck with a Hammer to produce 2 Bone Shards.

Only 100 skeletons can exist in the world at one time, and any new ones generated after will vanish and leave Ashes behind.

When the player dies, an identical skeleton with a special character examination quote will be left in that location with the player's items, implying that all set pieces are dead players.

## Trivia
- The model of the Skeleton is the same model as the unimplemented character Wilton found in the Don't Starve files.
- The word 'Boon' means 'Favor' and given that skeletons make up the majority of boons, it's likely that this is a pun on the word "Bones".
- There is a type of skeleton in Don't Starve Together that appears

## Quotes

- Wilson: Hey, isn't gold really soft?
- Willow: It won't light rocks on fire, but at least it's shiny.
- Wolfgang: Fancy pickaxe do better smash.
- Wendy: At least I can smash rocks with style.
- WX78: GOLD IS MORE DURABLE?
- Wickerbottom: The most malleable of metals, but let's see how this mines.
- Woody: Almost an axe, but not quite.
- Maxwell: This must be game logic.
- Wagstaff: Strange, the gold makes it more durable, not less.
- Wigfrid: Göld för göld.

## Opulent Pickaxe

The Opulent Pickaxe is a variant of the normal Pickaxe that has four times as much durability and requires Gold instead of Flint, allowing Flint to be saved for other uses. It requires 2 Gold Nuggets and 4 Twigs to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Opulent Pickaxe has 132 uses, 4 times as many as the normal Pickaxe. It has the same mining efficiency (6 hits per boulder) and damage (27.2 damage per strike) as the normal Pickaxe.

## Usage

To mine an object with the Pickaxe, right-click it from the inventory to equip it and left-click on the object. Once the character begins to mine, hold down the LMB or Spacebar to keep mining until the object breaks. Alternatively, one can mine faster by repeatedly clicking LMB with specific timing.

## Recipe

- **Item 1**: Opulent Pickaxe
- **Item 2**: Luxury Axe
- **Item 3**: Thulecite (Count: 2)
- **Result**: PickSlashAxe
- **Ancient 2**: Yes

## Bugs

There is a glitch where the Pickaxe (and other tools) can have 0% durability and remain equipped in the weapon slot instead of breaking. It disappears when the player opens and closes the map, unequips the tool, or quits and resumes the game. Trying to mine something with the bugged Pickaxe will often crash the game or will only cause the player to examine the rock.

## Trivia

- The Opulent Pickaxe was added in the October 2nd, 2012 update.
- When the Opulent Pickaxe is equipped, a 'ding' sound can be heard.
- In reality, gold is not a practical metal to be used in tools or weapons as it is a soft metal; it would easily deform and break. This is often remarked when examined by some Characters.

# Year of the Carrat

## Exclusivity
Don't Starve Together

## Event
Year of the Carrat

Competing in a **Carrat** race is the only method of obtaining **Lucky Gold Nuggets** during the event. It can be initiated by placing a Carrat at a **Starting Point** and by activating the bell. The race can be started at any moment.

When the race starts, 3 of **Charlie's Carrat**s appear as competitors if only one carrat entered the race. All competitors run to the closest **Checkpoint** in range and keep going until all checkpoints have been visited by all competitors. The race finishes when all competitors reach a **Finish Line**.

Once per day, competitors bring back a **Red Pouch** to their owner. The winning Carrat receives a large Red Pouch with 2 to 12 Lucky Gold Nuggets, depending on the length of the race, with 1 extra Lucky Gold Nugget every 4.5 tiles. All other competitors receive a small Red Pouch with 1 Lucky Gold Nugget.

## Infused Moon Shards
Infused Moon Shards are a resource exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them.

Infused Moon Shards are initially obtained by mining the randomly spawned Charged Glassy Rocks in Moonstorms. Celestial Champion also drops 6-12 of them upon its death. After Lunar Rifts are activated, Infused Moon Shards fall to the ground during Lunar Hail, with a 25% chance to remain for a few seconds during which they can be picked up.

Wilson with the Lunar Innovator Skill can craft 2 Infused Moon Shards with 1 Pure Brilliance, as well as use 3 Infused Moon Shards to craft 1 Pure Brilliance.

After 12 minutes, Infused Moon Shards "spoil" and leave behind regular Moon Shards.

## Usage
Infused Moon Shards are used to upgrade the Lunar Siphonator into its second and complete stages, which is needed for summoning Celestial Champion. The second stage requires 10 shards, while to complete it requires 20.

**Recipe:**
- **Item 1:** Infused Moon Shard (3)
- **Result:** Pure Brilliance (1)
- **Character:** Wilson
- **Skill:** Lunar Innovator

**Recipe:**
- **Item 1:** Infused Moon Shard (1)
- **Item 2:** Pure Brilliance (4)
- **Item 3:** Brightshade Husk (4)
- **Result:** Brightshade Bomb (6)
- **Tool:** Brightsmithy

## Trivia
- Infused Moon Shards were introduced in the Eye of the Storm update.
- When it was first introduced, this item only took 90 seconds to spoil into Moon Glass. Its fast spoil time encouraged players to have some Bundling Wrap handy, as getting to the Lunar Island within 90 seconds was virtually impossible without teleportation. This was changed in the October 2021 QoL update.
- Dropping models of Infused Moon Shard actually correspond one-to-one to the regular Moon Shard.

## Scrapbook Info
Roughly doubles the number of birds that will land near the wearer.

The Feather Hat is a Hat Item found in the Clothing Filter. It requires 2 Crimson Feathers, 3 Jet Feathers, and 2 Tentacle Spots to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. A Sewing Kit repairs 62.5% of its durability.

It restores 2 Sanity/min while worn.

When worn, the Feather Hat attracts more flying Birds (Redbirds, Snowbirds, and Crows) to land on the ground. By default, only 4 Birds at most will land with a delay of 5–15 seconds in between. With the Feather Hat equipped, up to 7 Birds may land with a 2-10 second delay. Birds will still fly away from a character wearing this headdress if the character approaches them. Wearing the Feather Hat while standing next to a Friendly Scarecrow will attract more Canaries to land.

The Feather Hat can also be given to a Pig or Bunnyman to wear, which provides no effect. It will still lose durability while worn. Additionally, it can be used with a Trail Mix to adopt a Giblet at the Rock Den.

## Usage
- Recipe
  - Item 1: Feather Hat
  - Item 2: Trail Mix
  - Tool: Rock Den
  - Result: Giblet

## Skins
In Don't Starve Together, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the Belongings page.
- **Woven - Elegant Feather Trimmed Hat**: Introduced during the official Year of the Beefalo event in 2021.
- **Loyal Equestrienne Headdress**: Awarded for watching 6 hours of Don't Starve Together on Twitch from November 8, 2018 to November 22, 2018, and from February 7, 2019 to February 14, 2019. It is also available in the Klei Rewards shop for 1,200 Klei points.

## Tips
- If trying to summon Krampus by killing birds without Wickerbottom and her Books, one can equip this hat while standing on Grass Turf to make a lot of birds spawn, then kill them with a Boomerang or another Ranged Weapon as they land on the ground.
- The player can also farm birds by trapping a Catcoon in a 1x1 cage with no corners and wearing the Feather Hat. The Catcoon will kill the birds that land on the ground.

# Straw Hat

## Description
The Straw Hat is a Hat Item found in the Dress Tab. It costs 12 Cut Grass to craft. It is required to construct the Miner Hat and the Bush Hat. In the base game, it has no functionality when worn.

## Downloadable Content
In DLCs the Straw Hat does not require a Science Machine to prototype. It provides small protection from Wetness and 60 points of protection from Overheating, and loses Durability when worn. The Sewing Kit repairs 100% of its durability.

## Seasonal Starting Items
With the Seasonal Starting Items default preset, the Straw Hat will be given to any players joining a world for the first time, during Spring.

## Crafting and Usage
The simple combination of using the Straw Hat and the Umbrella is enough to prevent the player from getting wet during rain, being an easy and accessible way out for the Wetness problem as the Straw Hat has a low cost based solely on Cut Grass.

In the Reign of Giants DLC, the Straw Hat is also one of the ingredients required to craft a Rain Hat.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, it is one of the ingredients required to craft the Snakeskin Hat, the Captain Hat, and the Dumbrella.

In the Hamlet DLC, Straw Hats can be bought for 3 Oincs at The Sow's Ear Hat Shop in the Pig City.

## Sanguine Experiment

The **Sanguine Experiment** is a feature exclusive to the **Hallowed Nights** event in **Don't Starve Together**. It can be conducted at the **Mad Scientist Lab**, using a **Mosquito** and a **Red Cap**, and depleting 10 **Sanity** for the player. The experiment has a 66% chance to result in a **Flask of Sanguine Mixture** and a 33% to result in a **Canteen of Sanguine Mixture**.

Both potions restore the player's **Health** upon consumption and slowly over time. The Flask initially restores 8 **HP** upon consumption, while the Canteen restores 20 **HP** upon consumption. During the next minute, both potions restore 1 **HP** every two seconds, adding up to an additional restoration of 30 **HP**. Both potions can also be used as **Fire** **Fuel**.

## Trivia

- The Mad Scientist Lab and all related craftable items were introduced to the Hallowed Nights event in 2018.
- When **Wormwood** consumes either of these potions, he does NOT receive the initial 8 / 20 **HP**, but will still restore 1 **HP** every two seconds, resulting in a total restoration of 30 **HP**.

Flint is an item used to craft basic tools. It can be found on the ground or by mining smooth or gold veined Boulders with the Pickaxe. Flint is one of the first and most needed items in the game and should be sought after as soon as a new game starts. It is recommended to always have a decent number of Flint at all times in the case the player needs to make basic Tools such as an Axe or a Pickaxe. Combat wise, the Spear can be built.

Flint can be given to Rock Lobsters to befriend them. Like all mineral items, it is not flammable and a food source for Slurtles and Snurtles.

Flint is renewable through Petrified Trees, Meteor showers, and Earthquakes in the Caves. Additionally, it can be farmed from Moleworms and Rock Lobsters.

After unlocking the "Transmute Ore Ⅰ" skill, Wilson is able to craft a Flint from three Rocks.

- Wurt: Sneaky!
- Walter: We learned how to make them in the Pinetree Pioneers.
- Wanda: The trap is fine, it's the part afterwards that makes me sad...
- Choose: Wendy

## Usage
Traps are set by placing them on the ground and can be picked up again at any time. To bait a Trap once set, simply place a food item in it. Bait will be consumed upon a successful catch. Once a Trap has caught something, it will shake and rattle around with the animal inside.

Traps do not need bait in order to catch creatures; if a creature touches the Trap for any reason, it will fall and possibly catch it. This means if a Trap is placed directly on top of a Rabbit Hole, it will attempt to catch the Rabbit when it leaves home or comes back. However, sometimes a Rabbit will disappear into its hole before the Trap falls completely, leaving no loot.

When a Trap is picked up from the ground still set to catch an animal, no durability is lost, allowing it to be moved around freely. When a Trap is picked up after being triggered, it will lose durability. A Trap will lose durability whether or not it catches the animal that triggered it.

Rabbits and Spiders are placed into the player's inventory when Traps are harvested. Caught Frogs instead automatically deposit the loot that would be gained from killing them normally.

## Hunting
A hostile creature can be lured into a Trap if it is chasing the player character; Spiders for example will always try to travel in a straight line and make no effort to avoid traps or other obstacles. Traps can be used in this way to form a barrier when destroying Spider Dens, or as a great method to farm Silk.

Traps are particularly useful during Winter, as they can be spread around a large area and placed atop Rabbit Holes for instant capture. In vanilla Don't Starve, Chests can be built nearby Rabbit Holes and filled with Rabbits to create a food stockpile.

## Downloadable Content
In DLCs, the creatures caught under a trap will struggle for a few days before starving to death and dropping their loot on the

## Description
Mangrove Trees are a type of **Tree** in the **Shipwrecked** DLC. They are found growing in the waters of the **Mangrove** biome and can only be accessed by **Boat** or **Raft**. They have a distinctive appearance with a bulbous trunk and roots that begin above the waterline.

When chopped down, the player receives 1 **Log** and 1 **Twig**, 1 Log and 2 Twigs or 2 Logs and 3 Twigs, depending on the tree's size.

There is no way to plant new Mangrove Trees, but they will regenerate fairly quickly so long as they are not completely destroyed.

## Tips
Mangrove Trees will not be destroyed if hit by a **Dragoon Egg** falling from the sky, they will only be "chopped" and drop the usual Twigs and Logs. They will however be destroyed if shot at with a **Boat Cannon**.

## Description
'''Flat Stone Turf''' is a [[Turfs|Turf]] [[Item]] exclusive to the ''[[Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet]]'' DLC. It can be found in the [[Pig City]] [[Biomes|Biome]]. Flat Stone Turf can be crafted using one [[Cut Stone]] in the [[City Planning Tab]] if the player is holding a [[Key to the City]].

When placed on the [[Surface World]] covering a large enough area, [[Pigeon]]s and [[Crow]]s are the only [[Birds]] that will spawn and land on these turfs. This turf prevents [[BFB]] from landing.

In the ''[[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]]'' DLC, this Turf will not spawn [[Flooding|Puddles]]. Tides and expanding Puddles can still flood this turf, however.

## Scrapbook Info

Can be placed on dirt ground to change the type of ground.

## Description

Carpeted Flooring is a craftable Turf Item. It requires 1 Beefalo Wool and 1 Board to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Like other turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as fuel.

Players can find Carpeted Flooring around Chess biomes. There are also some Set Pieces that spawn a few tiles of Carpeted Flooring.

Eyeplants cannot spawn on this Turf, making it an expensive and artificial way of protecting oneself from Lureplants. Plants like Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Pine Cones, and Birchnuts can't be planted on these turfs, unless these were planted before the turfs were placed.

When placed on the Surface World and the area is large enough, Crows are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs.

Although 1 Beefalo Wool is used to craft the Carpeted Flooring and Beefalo Wool is mainly used to craft warm clothing for Winter, Carpeted Flooring does not provide the player with any warmth.

## Usage

### Recipe

- **Item1**: Boards
  - **Count1**: 2
- **Item2**: Marble
  - **Count2**: 2
- **Item3**: Carpeted Flooring
  - **Count3**: 2
- **Result**: End Table
- **Tool**: Blueprint (rare)

## Trivia

- Carpeted Flooring was introduced in the A Little Rain Must Fall update.
- Before the Hungry For Your Hunger update, Carpeted Flooring required the Shadow Manipulator to prototype.
- It is one of four craftable turfs in base Don't Starve (the others being Cobblestones, Wooden Flooring, and Checkerboard Flooring).
- In older versions of Don't Starve, Carpeted Flooring could be found in the same area as Maxwell's Door, along with Marble Pillars.

- While the change log for the **March 2022 QoL update** noted that the Marble Bean was moved to the Alchemy Engine, this was already the case before the update.

  - {{SW}}: {{Pic24|Butterfly Wings SW}} 98% {{Pic24|Butter}} 2%
- **Spawn Code**: "butterfly"

## Description
The **Butterfly** is a passive [[Mobs|Mob]] commonly found in [[Grasslands|Grassland]] [[biomes]]. They spawn from [[Flower]]s (including Evil Flowers) and will slowly fly around, often landing on other Flowers within 30 meters. At [[dusk]], they will attempt to land on a Flower to despawn. Butterflies do not spawn during [[Winter]] or in Caves.

Butterflies can be caught with [[Bug Net]]. As [[inventory]] [[item]]s, they can be used to plant Flowers, which can spawn additional Butterflies or improve the production of [[Honey]] in [[Bee Box]]es. In all [[DLC]]s, Butterflies inside the player's inventory will starve in 2 [[day]]s unless fed. They can be fed with anything edible to the player, however, the damage of the food applies to Butterflies as well, killing them if fed due to Butterflies only having 1 {{hp}}.

When killed, Butterflies drop [[Butterfly Wings]] (98% chance) or [[Butter]] (2% chance). Butterflies are considered innocent creatures, and killing one adds 1 point to the player's [[naughtiness]] level. Catching Butterflies with a [[Bug Net]] will not affect naughtiness.

## Hunting
Butterflies will try to move 10 meters away from the player when the player is within 5 meters, making them difficult to attack using melee weapons. The best time to attack Butterflies is when they land on Flowers, where they will rest for a few seconds. Hunting in an area with many Flowers will provide many opportunities to hit them. If a player scared the butterfly by being within 5 meters, the player can move to 10 meters away from the butterfly to calm the butterfly, to perhaps be in a better situation to kill the butterfly.

Even a fleeing Butterfly can be chased down and killed by pressing the force-attack button (Ctrl+F) within range. The butterfly's actual position is best determined through its shadow. The [[Walking Cane]] makes chasing and attacking butterflies much easier.

When caught using a Bug Net, a live Butterfly will become an item in the player's inventory (stacks to 20). With the Bug Net equipped, pressing the Spacebar automatically chases and catches Butterflies rather than picking nearby Flowers.

Butterflies die in one hit from any weapon. Butterflies take one blast from the [[Ice Staff]] to be frozen and cannot be put to sleep.

## Farming
A flower can be planted in the middle of base. The flower in a communal base will spawn butterfly faster, scaling with the number of players in base, since there are multiple players around to contribute to butterfly's spawn rate. The butterflies can be killed by an aggressive Abigail, or a player camping beside the flower. Having more flowers is counterproductive as they randomize the possible spawning spot for butterfly.

A flower can be planted near [[Beefalo]] herds. Beefaloes will attack any Butterflies that spawn from Flowers during their mating season. Any items that the Butterflies drop can be safely collected while wearing a [[Beefalo Hat]].

A flower can be planted around an [[Elephant Cactus]]. The spawning butterflies will be killed by the Elephant Cactus. However, players will need to wear a [[Cactus Armor]] to be able to harvest the drops

# Compromising Statue

![Compromising Statue](Screenshot 2023-07-25 at 20.48 Background Removed.06.png)

The **Compromising Statue** is an object exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Pocket Edition** of **Don't Starve**. When the player creates a world with the **No-Sweat Mode** preset applied, it will spawn. Upon death, the statue will revive the player and will drop 1-2 **Rocks**, along with 2 **Flint**.

## Quotes

- Wilson: "I made a compromise with wilderness."
- Willow: "Be the phoenix."
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang is stronger than death!"
- Wendy: "It snatches me from the jaws of death."
- WX-78: "BACKUP DRIVE DETECTED"
- Wickerbottom: "A tether for mortal life energy."
- Woodie: "This here'll save my back bacon."
- Maxwell: "For when my defenses have been compromised."
- Wigfrid: "Döömed never tö die in battle! Ö, wöe!"
- Webber: "It makes sure nothing bad happens to us."

## Properties

- **HP Restored**: 1/2 of max
- **Hunger Restored**: 2/3 of max
- **Sanity Restored**: 3/4 of max
- **Resources**: *Rocks* ×1-2, *Flint* ×2
- **Perk**: Revives the player
- **Renew**: Cannot be destroyed
- **Durability**: Infinite

## Resurrection Stats

- **Health** is set to 75
- **Hunger** is set to 100
- **Sanity** is set to 150
- Penalties that normally afflict the player upon death and in other revival circumstances, such as empty **inventory** (items can be recovered at the place of death, as long as they haven't been destroyed by any means) and reset of most **Characters** abilities (*Wilson* and *Webber* will be beardless; *WX-78* loses all *Gears*).

## Tips

- Fighting a group of **Mobs** or **Boss Monsters** near the Compromising Statue may result in the player being killed repeatedly, as the statue resurrects them without any **items**.
- Due to the Compromising Statue being able to be used infinitely without penalty, it may be plausible to intentionally die in order to regain stats if the player has either under 75 Health, 100 Hunger, or 150 Sanity, and they're also near the Compromising Statue to receive their items back.

Blow Dart costs 2 Cut Reeds, 1 [[Hound's Tooth]], & 1 [[Feather|Azure]] Feather to craft. It is also dropped by [[MacTusk N' Son|MacTusk]]. On use, it deals 100 damage to its target.

1 shot will turn neutral Mobs, such as [[Koalefant|Koalefants]], hostile. 2 shots destroy a [[Beehive]]. 1-5 shots can kill normal [[Mobs]] (e.g. [[Guardian Pig]]s, MacTusk, [[Merm]]s).

### Downloadable Content
In ''Shipwrecked'', the [[Slot Machine]] may drop Blow Darts.

In ''[[Hamlet]]'', Blow Darts drop when using [[Disarming Tools]] on [[Striking Carving]]s or [[Striking Statue]]s in the ruins. They can also be bought for 10 [[Oinc]]s at [[The Boar's Tusk Weapon Shop]].

Fire Dart costs 2 [[Cut Reeds]], 1 [[Charcoal]], & 1 [[Feather|Crimson]] Feather to craft. On use, it deals 0 direct damage but up to 120 fire damage.

Mobs killed by fire drop food as cooked (e.g. a [[Rabbit]] would drop a cooked [[Morsel]]); most other drops turn to [[Ashes]]. Firing at a [[Spider Den]] will destroy it (without dropping any loot) and force [[Spider]]s out. Fire Darts can also set [[Hay Wall|Hay]] and [[Wood Wall|Wood]] walls on fire.

- **Wormwood**: Lots of rocks
- **Wheeler**: Nothing will get past these strategically placed seashells!
- **Choose**: Wagstaff

The Armored Boat is a type of craftable Boat in the Shipwrecked DLC. It can be found in the Nautical Tab and requires an Alchemy Engine and 6 Boards, 3 Rope, and 10 Seashells to craft. It begins with 500 durability, which will deplete if damaged or as it is used. It can be repaired with the Boat Repair Kit or the Sea Yard. While moving, it loses Durability at a rate of 1 per 3.84 seconds, lasting a total of 4 Days.

The Armored Boat has 2 seconds of [hit immunity](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/219740/view/2919977626398219425), a period of time in which they will not trigger the hit state after being hit. This is the best out of all Boats. It is also tied with the Cargo Boat and Encrusted Boat for the best map reveal range of 2.5.

The Armored Boat is one of the boats with equipment slots, allowing the player to equip Sails, Boat Lanterns, Boat Cannons and Trawl Nets.

### Tips
- Destroying an Armored Boat with a Hammer yields 3 Boards, 2 Rope, and 5 Seashells regardless of its durability. Since Seashells are very common and easier to collect than Stingers, it can be more practical to craft a new Armored Boat rather than use Boat Repair Kits to repair heavy damage. Having a boat pre-crafted and ready to deploy as needed allows for even more flexibility.

### Thulecite Details
Thulecite is a craftable item found in the Ancient Pseudoscience Filter. It requires 6 Thulecite Fragments and a Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station to be crafted. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Thulecite cannot be prototyped and Characters must stand near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft it.

Its main use is as a crafting material for items in the Ancient Tab. Additionally, it can be used to repair a Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station, opening up more crafting options.

Thulecite can also be acquired by destroying Ancient Statues with a Pickaxe, Gunpowder, etc., or gathered from Cave Holes with The Lazy Forager. After killing the Ancient Fuelweaver, an event triggers that respawns the Ancient Statues in the Ruins, providing a renewable source of Thulecite and Gems. Players must wait 20 days until the Ancient Fuelweaver can be fought again.

Thulecite has a 10% chance to be found in Ornate Chests and a 75% chance in Large Ornate Chests. It can also randomly drop when destroying Relics or damaging Ancient Pseudoscience Stations with a Hammer or by other methods.

With the Forgotten Knowledge update, Thulecite can be gathered by utilizing the Dust Moths found in the Ancient Archive. After feeding one an Amberosia, it will begin to ornate a nearby Tidy Hidey-Hole with mineable Thulecite Fragments. Because Amberosia is renewable, this provides another reliable (albeit slow) source of Thulecite as an alternative to killing the Ancient Fuelweaver.

# Thermal Stone

## Overview
The **Thermal Stone**, also known as **Heat Stone**, is a [[Survival]] item in ''[[Don't Starve]]''. It requires an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype, and costs 10 [[Stone]], 1 [[Pickaxe]], and 3 [[Flint]] to craft. Its purpose is to delay body temperature change, preventing the player from [[Freezing]] in [[Winter]] as well as [[Overheating]] in [[Summer]] ([[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|RoG]]).

## Mechanics
A Thermal Stone acts as a heat source with an internal temperature between -20° and +90°. With the thermal stone in the inventory, the player's own body will attempt to reach a temperature given by the formula:
\[ T_b = \frac{T_a + 2.1 \times T_h}{3.1} \]
where \( T_b \) is the target body temperature, \( T_a \) is the ambient temperature, and \( T_h \) is the temperature of the thermal stone.

If the stone is on the ground instead, the target body temperature is instead given by:
\[ T_b = \frac{T_a + T_h}{2} \]
which is simply the midpoint between the ambient temperature and the thermal stone's temperature.

The temperature of a heated thermal Stone drops at a rate determined by 120 insulation, which is 1 degree every 5 seconds. This insulation is only used for determining the stone's own temperature loss and does not affect the player.

### Temperature Stages
The stage of the thermal stone is determined relative to the ambient temperature and each stage emits a fixed temperature:

| Stage | Internal Temperature |
|-------|----------------------|
| ![Heat Stone Stage 1](Heat_Stone_Stage_1.png) | more than 30° below ambient temperature |
| ![Heat Stone Stage 2](Heat_Stone_Stage_2.png) | between 30° and 10° below ambient temperature |
| ![Thermal Stone](Thermal_Stone.png) | between 10° below and 10° above ambient temperature |
| ![Heat Stone Stage 4](Heat_Stone_Stage_4.png) | between 10° and 30° above ambient temperature |
| ![Heat Stone Stage 5](Heat_Stone_Stage_5.png) | more than 30° above ambient temperature |

## Downloadable Content
In all [[DLC]]s, cold Thermal Stones can be used in the [[Summer]] or [[Dry Season]] to prevent [[Overheating]]. A Thermal Stone can be cooled by placing it next to an [[Endothermic Fire]], in an [[Ice Box]], or in [[Snow Chester]]. Thermal Stones placed in Snow Chester will cool at half the rate that they would in an ice box.

While carried in any [[Backpack]], including the [[Insulated Pack]], Thermal Stones can still affect the player's temperature.

In the ''Reign of Giants'' DLC, [[Moleworm]]s can steal Thermal Stones, so caution must be taken, especially around [[Deciduous Forest]] biomes. Thermal Stones no longer emit light.

In the ''Shipwrecked'' DLC, Thermal Stones are an ingredient for the [[Ice Maker 3000]].

## Usage
### Recipe
**Thermal Stone**
- **item1**: Thermal Stone
- **item2**: Electrical Doodad
- **count2**: 2
- **item3**: Bamboo
- **count3**: 5
- **tool**: Alchemy Engine
- **result**: Ice Maker 3000
- **dlc**: Shipwrecked

## Tips
- The crafting recipe will accept pickaxes of any durability, so it is advised to use pickaxes that are at 3% durability to avoid wasting their use.
- In Winter, the Thermal Stone actually freezes the player at its coldest state, and during Summer/dry season hot Thermal Stones overheat the player. [[Chester]], [[Packim Baggims]] or [[Hutch]] can be utilized to carry the cold/hot Thermal Stones, without affecting player temperature. Companions are immune to the effects of Freezing and Overheating.
- Having more than one Thermal Stone, one carried with the player, the other one kept charged (near a fire for warmth, or in an Ice Box for cool) allows quick switching, instead of waiting for a single one to charge.
  - Keeping a thermal stone by a fire for purposes other than warming up is ill advised as it will use up the thermal stone's durability over time.
- The best way to maximize the heat from your Thermal Stone is to stand near two Campfires or a burning object until you overheat. This will provide you the maximum heat

## Description
Bat Caves are exclusive objects found in the Caves in **[Don't Starve Together]**. They spawn **Batilisks**, thus allowing players to determine if the area contains Batilisks while also making them renewable in the Caves.

When a player comes close to a Bat Cave, a **Batilisk** will spawn every 20 seconds to a maximum of 4 Batilisks. It takes 2 minutes for a Bat Cave to respawn a single Batilisk.

## Trivia
- Before Bat Caves were added, Batilisks were not renewable underground. They are renewable in the overworld, however, since **Sinkholes** spawn Batilisks at **Dusk** and Night.
- In the single-player version of **Don't Starve**, Bat Caves can be spawned using console commands. When the player comes close to a Bat Cave, a Batilisk will spawn every 0.1 seconds to a maximum of 6 Batilisks. It takes 1 minute for a Bat Cave to respawn a single Batilisk.

The Miner Hat is a **Hat** [Item](https://www.example.com/wiki/Category:Hats) which provides **Light** while worn. It is found in the **Light Tab** and requires 1 **Straw Hat**, 1 **Gold Nugget**, and 1 **Fireflies** to craft, and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. It can also be found randomly at Skeleton **Set Piece**s.

The Miner Hat allows the player to keep their hands free, allowing weapons or tools to be used at night. It provides brighter and longer lasting light than a **Torch** (about 8 minutes / 1 day of light).

In order to keep producing light, the Miner Hat needs to be refueled with **Fireflies**, **Slurtle Slime**, or **Light Bulb**s before durability runs out. It doesn't break at 0% durability, though. Fireflies will refuel it for 38.5%, which will last for 180 seconds; Light Bulbs for 19%, which will last for 90 seconds; and Slurtle Slime for 9.5%, which will last for 45 seconds.

Unlike the **Lantern**, a Miner Hat will always retain its maximum level of brightness even when its durability declines.

Pigs, Bunnymen, and Splumonkeys can also wear Miner Hats to light up their surroundings, and having the hat worn will prevent Pigs from panicking from the darkness.

**Downloadable Content:**  
In **DLC**s, the Miner Hat provides an additional 20% **Water Resistance** to the wearer in the **Rain**.

In the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, **Bioluminescence** can also refuel the Miner Hat, restoring 38.5% of durability.

In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, Miner Hats can be bought for 20 **Oinc**s at the **Pigg and

# Pick/Axe

- Wurt: "That pretty smart, florp."
- Walter: "It's two tools in one!"
- Wanda: "This will save me precious time!"

## Pick/Axe Tips

- The Luxury Axe and Opulent Pickaxe used in the recipe can be in any condition without affecting the durability of the resulting Pick/Axe.
- In DST, Thulecite is not renewable. Even though they take a second inventory slot and mine 20% slower, Opulent Pickaxes and Luxury Axes may be a better bargain because Gold Nuggets and Twigs are so much easier to acquire.
- When a Pick/Axe is low on durability, players can use a Deconstruction Staff to get both the Luxury Axe and Opulent Pickaxe back each at 100% durability, plus one thulecite.

## Trivia

- The Pick/Axe used to be called "Multitool" and had a different look before being implemented with the **Stuff of Nightmares** update.

They are considered innocent creatures even though they are not passive or neutral, and killing one adds 2 points to the player's naughtiness level.

## Details
- **Category:** [[Light Sources Filter]]
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** "molehat"
- **Perk:** Grants Nightvision.
- **Ingredients:**
  - Moleworm: 2
  - Electrical Doodad: 2

- **Tier:** 2
- **Discharge Rate:** 1.5 days

- Walter: "These work way better than the X-ray goggles I mailed in for back home!"
- Wanda: "What a funny looking hat. Let me try it on!"

## Skins
In Don't Starve Together, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the Belongings page.

- Woven - Elegant Decorator's Collection Moggles 2.0: "Two noses are better than one."
- Woven - Elegant Moggles 3.0: "Nose to tail. Nothing wasted."

## Tips
- Moggles are the only portable non-character-exclusive means of acquiring 100% visibility at night or underground.
- Moggles can be particularly useful when dealing with Cave Spiders and Spitters.
- They are especially handy when exploring the Ruins since the player is able to spot danger and prepare for the lying monsters in wait.
- Moggles will be destroyed if they reach 0%, so the player should make sure to un-equip or refuel them before this happens.
- Briefly equipping Moggles will instantly kill any nearby Night Hands.
- As with any other fuel, only 75% of the item's normal fuel value is added if the Glow Berries or Lesser Glow Berries are wet. If these items are scarce, the player should take care to let them dry before refueling the Moggles.
- Since the Glow Berries needed to refuel them also cost 20 Oincs at the Oddities Emporium and only refuel about a third of the durability, it is recommended to simply buy a new pair of moggles when they run out.

## Trivia
- Upon release, the recipe for Moggles was 2 Moleworms, 2 Electrical Doodads, and 4 Silk. It could be repaired with a Sewing Kit instead of needing to be refueled.
- Hovering over objects that can be examined or standing under a shaft of light in Caves while using the Moggles will make the objects appear in black and white.
- The word "Moggles" is a portmanteau of the words "Mole" and "Goggles".
- Wickerbottom's quote is clearly about the original design of the moggles, as the original design appeared to have moleworm noses over the wearer's eyes.
- Players wearing Moggles are able to see other players being attacked by Charlie. It appears as though a hand pulls itself through their mouth as darkness swarms them briefly.
- The Moggles 2.0 skin is based on the original Moggles design from the Reign of Giants DLC for Don't Starve.

## Bugs
- Occasionally, the Moggles will not work underground. This can usually be fixed by exiting and re-entering the level they have ceased to function in.

  ![Red](Fungus Turf Red Dropped.png)
  ![Green](Fungus Turf Green Dropped.png)

## Usage
Fungal Turfs are [[Turf]] [[items]] acquired by digging Fungal Turf tiles with a [[Pitchfork]]. They can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as [[Fire#Fuel|fuel]]. They are found in caves and come in three colors: blue, red, and green. Variants of [[Mushtrees]] and [[Mushrooms]] can be found on these Turfs, and they cover the ground of a [[Mushtree Forest]].

Plants like [[Berry Bush]]es, [[Grass Tuft]]s, [[Saplings]], [[Spiky Bush]]es, [[Lureplant]]s, [[Pine Cone]]s, and [[Birchnut]]s can be planted on all types of Fungal Turfs. [[Lureplant/DST|Lureplant]] can spawn on all fungal turfs. All types of Fungal Turf, when placed on the [[Surface World]] in an area large enough, will only allow [[Crows]] to spawn on the turf.

Fungal Turf can be crafted and prototyped with 1 [[Lichen]] and 1 type of [[Mushroom Spore]] at [[Terra Firma Tamper]] in the [[Decorations Filter]]. Blue, red, and green Spores can only be used to craft blue, red, and green Fungal Turf, respectively.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC, Spiders have a chance to spawn after picking Tumbleweeds. There is also a rare chance for them to drop Webber's Skull. Webber's familiar appearance makes Spiders neutral towards him, and they can be befriended with any spare meats, essentially making them Webber's equivalent to Pigs. Webber himself also doesn't lose any sanity when hanging around any Spiders.

In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, spending Dubloons at the Slot Machine has a chance to spawn 3 Spiders.

While Spiders don’t appear in the **Hamlet** DLC by default, being replaced by Spider Monkeys. Webber can still place Spider Eggs and therefore bring Spiders to the Plateau. If needed, he can also kill Spider Monkeys for Spider Glands and use the Reeds from the Lily Pond to make Papyrus and therefore more Spider Eggs, or let the Spider Queen spread more dens.

## Behavior

If a survivor other than Webber steps on the Sticky Webbing around a Spider Den, it will prompt a number of Spiders to come out, roar, and investigate the spot of webbing. Attacking those Spiders while either party is on the webbing signals the entire cluster to the den's defense. If a player merely steps on a corner and runs far enough from the webbing, then the Spiders will go to that corner, give another roar, and then retreat from the sun. If the player spends some time on the Sticky Webbing, the Spiders will follow the player until they're killed, the Spiders die, or the player runs too far.

At dusk, Spiders leave their dens and roam around. If left alone, they return to their dens at dawn. A Spider that's caught outside during the day (whether its den was destroyed or it's too far away) falls asleep. Spending a few seconds close to a sleeping Spider awakens it and causes it to attack, though it will go back to sleep if it's outrun. Spiders spawned by Spider Queens will not naturally sleep, and will instead simply stick nearby the Queen. If the Queen is killed, they will act like homeless spiders and sleep during the day as normal.

Spiders that get too close to bright lights like Campfires usually get frightened and flee, unless they see food or they are targeting something.

Spiders that see any kind of meat on the ground will attempt to eat it. Spiders are comfortable eating even their own Monster Meat and inedible Pig Skin. Unlike normal Pigs, Spiders are endlessly hungry and will easily eat an entire stack of Meat if allowed. Spiders ignore placed Traps even while in the middle of an attack, making them easy to bait into the Traps.

## Hunting

Spiders found wandering at Night can easily be killed with melee weapons. When hit, Spiders will be stunlocked and unable to attack for a few moments, during which time they can be hit again. After the
