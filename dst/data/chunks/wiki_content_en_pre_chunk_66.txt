**Guano** is an item dropped by **Batilisks**, similar to **Manure**, colored grayish-white. It can occasionally be found where Batilisks are commonly found, such as near unplugged **Sinkholes** and on **Stalagmite Terrain**.

Guano is 1.5 times more effective than Manure when used as a fertilizer, although it cannot be used to craft farm plots. It creates an aesthetic gas cloud when used as a fuel source.

In **Don't Starve Together**, there is a 33% chance for Guano to drop when feeding seeds to a bird in a birdcage. It will, however, appear much smaller than the Guano dropped by Batilisks.

### Usage
**Recipe:**
- **Item**: Guano
- **Count**: 2
- **Tool**: Terra Firma Tamper
- **Result**: Guano Turf
- **Result Count**: 4

### Trivia
- In real life, guano is a great fertilizer as well, although the bat variant is the weakest version of guano available.

## Description
A **Doydoy Egg** is a large spotted blue-green egg. They can be found by picking **Doydoy Nests**, which are spawned when **Doydoys** mate. Unlike **Tallbirds**, Doydoys will not chase the player if their egg is stolen. Doydoy Eggs will hatch into Baby Doydoys only when they are in a Doydoy Nest, and unlike **Tallbird Eggs** they cannot be made to hatch around **Campfire**. However, placing them in empty Nests allows them to hatch.

When used in **Crock Pot**s, Doydoy eggs will have an **Egg** value of 1 (this is the same as 1 **Egg**). Thus, it is not recommended to use Doydoy Eggs in cooking unless you have at least 2 Doydoy Eggs or living Doydoys.

# Ocean

In the original **Don't Starve** and **Reign of Giants** content, the **Ocean** acts as a barrier, and during **Winter**, a place for **Pengull**s to spawn before they hop onto shore. No living thing can cross the ocean, not even flying **mobs** like **Batilisks** and **Bees**. **Flotsam**s can be found in the ocean, and it is the only object the player can interact with in the ocean. Objects that are situated on the coast very close to the ocean may drop their items in the ocean, and aside from bugged objects, they will fall into the water with a splash.

## Shipwrecked

In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, the Ocean plays a much larger role in the player's everyday life. It is accessible by boat or raft, and is commonly divided into several sections: **Shallow Ocean**, **Medium Ocean**, **Deep Ocean**, **Ship Graveyard**, and **Coral Reef**. Flotsam and Pengulls do not spawn in the **Shipwrecked** Ocean.

Some items, instead of sinking, will stay afloat. Unless the item sunk in Deep Ocean, the sunken item will periodically create bubbles, indicating its location. Within 2 days from the time the item sunk, it can be retrieved by sailing over it while using a **Trawl Net**. If the item is not retrieved during this time, it will be lost forever. Items that sink in the Deep Ocean tiles are immediately lost and cannot be retrieved.

### Shallow

- Light blue terrain.
- No **Waves** (present waves will disappear once they reach the edge).
- **Mussels**, **Wobster Den**s, **Dogfish**, and **Seaweed** are found here.
- **Seagulls** and **Cormorants** will land here dropping **Seeds** and **Roe**, respectively. (They do not appear during **Hurricane Season**).

### Medium

- Light/dark patchy blue when being next to shallow ocean, or solid dark blue terrain for the most distant from land.
- Waves form and travel here.
- **Stink Rays**, **Suspicious Bubbles** (**Whales**), **Shoals**, and the **Volcano** are found here.
- Never touches an island - it indicates empty aquatic space in-between.

### Deep

- Light/dark patchy blue when being next to shallow ocean, or solid dark blue terrain for the most distant from land.
- Waves form and travel here.
- **Stink Rays**, **Suspicious Bubbles** (**Whales**), **Shoals**, **Swordfish**, and the **Volcano** are found here.
- Never touches an island - it indicates empty aquatic space in-between.

### Ship Graveyard

- Small patches of dark colored areas in the Deep Ocean.
- **Wrecks** and **Watery Graves** can only be found here. Commonly contains Shoals, Seaweed and Swordfish.
- Can be next to Medium Ocean, but not Shallow Ocean or islands.

### Volcano

In the **Volcano Biome**, the Ocean that surrounds the Shipwrecked world is replaced by a sea of clouds.

Items dropped at the edge of the Volcano may fall through below the cloud layer and become inaccessible. **Strong Winds** can also push dropped items off the edge. Therefore, it is not recommended to leave important items such as **Obsidian** on the ground during **Hurricane Season**.

## Hamlet

In the **Hamlet** DLC, the Ocean that surrounds the world is replaced by a sea of clouds. It separates the Hamlet map into five distinct islands.

Items dropped at the edge of the island may fall through below the cloud layer and become inaccessible. **Strong Winds** can also push dropped items off the edge.

## Trivia

- The **Strange New Powers** update added **Pengulls** which initially spawn in the ocean, before moving onto the shore in Winter.
- **Shadow Creatures** are able to cross into and out of the ocean as they please, but will stay until running toward a player on land should they be aggressive towards them.
- Players using console commands can get over the ocean, but going too far will cause the screen to turn black while only showing the selected character, HUD, Crafting Tabs, Day-Night Indicator, and Inventory. Going further will cause the game to crash.
- In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, the following **Items** will float on the Ocean: (List of items follows)

# Spiderhat

## Description
The Spiderhat is a Hat Item dropped by Spider Queens that allows the player to control Spiders. This also works for all the Spiders in Caves, but they will not follow the player in or out of the caves. However, Spider Queens will see through this disguise and will attack the player regardless. The hat only lasts for 2 minutes (6 game hours), degrading while equipped.

## Details

- **Equip Slot**: Head
- **Deconstruct**: Silk ×4, Spider Gland ×2, Monster Meat ×1
- **Image**: ![Spiderhat Dropped](Spiderhat%20Dropped.png)
- **Icon**: ![Spiderhat](Spiderhat.png)
- **Water Resistance**: 20% resistance
- **Wears Out**: 2 min
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Dropped By**: Spider Queen, Loot Stash
- **Perk**: Control Spiders
- **Spawn Code**: "spiderhat"
- **Sanity Drain**: -2.00/min

## Quotes
- Wilson: "I hope I got all of the spider goo out of it."
- Willow: "Who's your mommy!"
- Wolfgang: "Is like smooch from giant bug."
- Wendy: "Time to stare into the abyss."
- WX-78: "IT WIRELESSLY TRANSMITS THOUGHTS TO SPIDERS"
- Wickerbottom: "With this I should be able to exert psionic control over the spiders."
- Woodie: "She's a real beaut, ain't she?"
- Maxwell: "Spiders have such malleable wills."
- Wagstaff: "A brain wave converter! Incredible!"
- Wigfrid: "A perfect way to infiltrate the enemy camp."
- Webber: "Very upsetting."
- Walani: "Ha! I'm your boss now, spiders!"
- Warly: "Well, it is on my head now. Best make the most of it."
- Woodlegs: "Wear a spider on me head? Bah!"
- Wilba: "FOR SPIDERS TO LEND WILBA THEIR EARS"
- Wormwood: "Leggy Bug head thing"
- Wheeler: "It'll be all the rage in the murky places."
- Winona: "This is disgusting."
- Wortox: "Hyuyu, this is grotesque!"
- Wurt: "Ha ha, look like Webby boy."
- Wanda: "A lovely reminder of that time I was almost eaten by a giant spider."

## Scrapbook Info
Up to 10 Spiders nearby will follow the wearer, but creatures who attack spiders will also attack the wearer. Does not work on Spiders spawned by a Spider Queen.

## Gameplay Tips
The Spiderhat is a great tool for quickly farming large amounts of Silk and Spider Glands. For this to work all that is needed are 3-4 Spider Dens and a Spiderhat. At Dusk when Spiders come out to roam - briefly equip the Spiderhat to recruit some Spiders and order them to attack one of the unaffected Spiders that is near a Den, then move out of their aggro range and unequip the hat to conserve its durability. This will result in a Spider "civil war", where non befriended Spiders will attack the previously befriended ones and result in a snowball effect.

## Trivia
- The Spiderhat was added in the Long Live the Queen update.
- Before Spoiled Rotten, the Spiderhat was craftable. It required a Straw Hat, a Spider Egg, and 4 Monster Meat. Its crafting description was "Spiders will call you 'mom'."

# Twitch Drops for Don't Starve Together

Twitch Drops is a system for obtaining collectibles by watching **Don't Starve Together** game streams on Twitch for a certain amount of time. They were first presented on September 28, 2018.

## Collectible Items

- **Profile Icons** - within 30 minutes of viewing
- **Portrait Frames** - for 1.5 hours and 30 minutes of viewing

Each campaign can only be obtained in a single copy of each, and once they are all obtained, they can no longer be obtained again until the next round.

All items received are of **Loyal** quality.

## How to Receive Exclusive Items

To receive exclusive items, you need to:

1. Connect your Klei account to Twitch
2. Watch broadcasts of streamers participating in the campaign (the “Drops enabled” tag must be present)
3. Click the "Get" button on the chat panel or on the Drops inventory page

Most previously dropped items can be obtained through [Klei rewards](https://accounts.klei.com/account/rewards). A profile icon costs 100 points, a portrait costs 400, and a property costs 1200.

## Tips

- Wurt loses sanity when holding a Spoiled Fish or Spoiled Fish Morsel in her inventory.
- Wormwood can initiate blooming by fertilizing himself with a Spoiled Fish or Spoiled Fish Morsel. If used in his third stage of bloom, a Spoiled Fish adds 2 minutes while a Spoiled Fish Morsel adds 1 minute. This is not worth it; it's better to wait until the third stage ends then use the Spoiled fish to regain it.
- Unlike Rot, Spoiled Fish and Spoiled Fish Morsels do not heal Wormwood.

## Trivia

- The Spoiled Fish and Spoiled Fish Morsel were added in the Hook, Line and Inker update.
- Before Reap What You Sow, Spoiled Fish dropped either 1 Rot with a 50% chance or 1 Bone Shards with a 50% chance, and Spoiled Fish Morsel dropped either 1 Rot with a 75% chance or 1 Bone shards with a 25% chance.

# Glow Berry
The **Glow Berry** (not to be confused with a [Lesser Glow Berry]) is the glowing lure of a [Depths Worm], dropped as loot upon its death. When eaten, it restores 11 HP and 25 Hunger but reduces Sanity by 10.

A Glow Berry will also cause any creature that consumes it, including [Bunnymen], [Pig]s, [Monkey|Splumonkeys], [Prime Ape]s and [Gobbler]s, to glow. The intensity of the glowing light decreases over time and will extinguish 240 seconds after consumption. If dropped on the ground, it will glow, similar to a [Light Bulb]. It emits enough light to prevent an attack from [Charlie].

**Glow Berries can be stacked up to 10 in the player's Inventory.** Glow Berries can be used to craft [Moggles]. Additionally, they can be used to refuel Moggles, extending their durability by 33%. [Warly] can use Glow Berries to make [Glow Berry Mousse] in the [Portable Crock Pot].

## Usage
### Recipes

1. **Manure**
   - **Ingredients**: Glow Berry
   - **Tool**: Pig Icon
   - **Note**: Pigs glow after eating Glow Berry.

2. **Moggles**
   - **Ingredients**: Glow Berry (1), Electrical Doodad (2), Moleworm (2)
   - **Tool**: Alchemy Engine

- **Choose**: willow

## Description
Broken Clockworks are naturally spawning structures that appear in the Ruins. The player can use 3 Gears to repair the Clockworks to spawn an allied chess piece, or destroy it with a Hammer.

In either case, a pile will drop the following loot:
- Frazzled Wires (1 + 55% chance of 2nd one)
- Gears (25% + 10% of 2nd if the pile was repaired)
- Melty Marbles (25%)
- Gems (25% Red Gem, 5% for each of Purple, Yellow, Orange, and Green)
- Thulecite (1%)

Repairing will cause two rolls of the loot table, doubling the loot gained overall in exchange for the gears spent. Taking into account the gear drops, the cost to repair each clockwork pile is 2.65 gears.

When hammered, there also exists a 10% chance of spawning a hostile Damaged Knight, Damaged Rook, or Damaged Bishop.

There are three different types of Broken Clockworks which spawn different types of clockworks with different probabilities, as indicated by the table below.

| Type | Damaged Knight | Damaged Bishop | Damaged Rook |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Type 1 | 50% | 50% | 0% |
| Type 2 | 70% | 0% | 30% |
| Type 3 | 0% | 70% | 30% |

## Trivia
- Repaired Clockwork Monsters will be allied.
- Each type of Broken Clockworks is made up of jumbled-up parts of the chess pieces that type can spawn:
  - Type 1 contains bishop's robe and head, and knight's head and bottom half
  - Type 2 contains rook's lower jaw and horn, and knight's head.
  - Type 3 contains bishop's robe and head, and rook's horn and leg.

Bunny Puffs are used to create the [Fur Roll] and the Rabbit Hutch. They can also be traded to the [Pig King] for two [Gold Nugget]s each and fed to [Pig]s to befriend them. Pigs, [Hound]s, and [Spider]s will eat Bunny Puffs on the ground.

# Metheus Puzzles

![Metheus 2](Metheus 2.png "Metheus 2")

The [Metheus Puzzles](https://metheus.dontstarvetogether.com/) are a set of Alternate Reality Game (ARG) puzzles, requiring an interconnected network of players (2 are needed for the Metheus Puzzles) to solve in the same fashion as the [Cyclum Puzzles] or [William Carter Puzzles]. 

Just as with the Cyclum Puzzles, signing in through the user's primary platform provider (Steam, PSN, Xbox, Epic Games, or Tencent WeGame) is a requirement. The Metheus Puzzles are a continuation of the [Cyclum Puzzles]. Completing the [Cyclum Puzzles] awarded the in-game item, The [Belongings|Tragic Torch], and both users must own the Tragic Torch to complete the Metheus Puzzles.

## Puzzles

### First Puzzle
In the bottom left of the screen is a tablet on a stand. Clicking the tablet enlarges it, allowing the user to access it. Along the top are a line of black symbols and a second line of gold symbols below it. On the bottom left and right side are buttons with the symbols randomly distributed across them.

To solve the puzzle, as well as every other puzzle afterwards, two players are required. The players need to copy opposing sets of the other's symbols (For example, player 1 copies player 2's gold symbols and Player 2 copies Player 1's black symbols, or vice versa). After each players' symbols have been copied, they can then click the blue symbol in the center. If both players are correct, the tiles around the center symbol will glow gold and purple, showing the two accounts have been successfully synced. The page will then refresh, revealing the right side of the obelisk and a second tablet, allowing both players access to the second part of the puzzle.

### Second Puzzle
The second puzzle is activated by clicking on the second tablet in the newly lit right side of the screen. One player's tablet will show tile squares with different numbers and positions of notches on their sides and a string of black symbols at the top, while the other's will show the opposite. In total, there are 32 symbols and 13 tiles. One partner will get the symbols and the other will get the tiles. They will each have a 3×2 grid of empty slots below the set of tiles/symbols. Under this is a sequence of six dots, and a button. In comparison to the first puzzle, the second puzzle is undoubtedly harder.

Firstly, the "codes" at the top establish a correspondence between tiles and symbols for six such symbol-tile pairs. Each of these symbol-tile pairs belongs in one of the empty slots, meaning that the solution is for each player to place the six symbols/tiles shown on their partner's code in a particular configuration (such that each slot will have a tile on one end and the "equivalent" symbol on the other).

If both players have the six slots filled out and press the button, a number of the dots may light up, corresponding to the number of slots that have both the right symbol and the right tile. Though the button lights up as long as at least one slot has been filled, this verification process can only be done if every slot have a symbol/tile in it.

Completing the puzzle is just a matter of switching the symbols and tiles that are in unison and submitting the answer in a cohesive fashion. When the players get all the tile placements correct, indicated by all 6 dots glowing, the button will begin to glow gold.

Players have a limited number of times that they can submit guesses of tile and symbol placements.

## Description
Mushrooms are naturally generated objects. There are three types of Mushrooms; Red, Green, and Blue, which can be harvested to receive a Red Cap, Green Cap, and Blue Cap. They can be used as Vegetable Food or filler in Crock Pot recipes, or given to a Pig to produce Manure. Each mushroom has different effects on Health, Hunger, and Sanity, therefore, a player needs to know the advantages and disadvantages of their effects and think hard before consuming them. However, when combined effectively, mushrooms are a very synergistic food.

Red Mushrooms are typically found in Grasslands or Forests and can only be picked during the day. Red Mushrooms have the worst effects of all the mushrooms, both raw and cooked. Green Mushrooms are typically found in Forests and Marshes, and can only be picked at Dusk. Blue Mushrooms are typically found in Grasslands and Marshes and can only be picked at Night.

Each mushroom will re-grow after 5 to 10.5 minutes of Rain. They can also be dug up at any time using a Shovel to obtain two Caps, but the mushroom spawn will be destroyed. Mushrooms do not grow during Winter.

Mushrooms will turn into Mushtrees during a Full Moon. After chopping down these Mushtrees, their stumps will turn into a harvested Mushroom spawn point.

The Mushroom Planter can be used to grow Mushrooms of all types by planting Caps or Mushroom Spores on them. Mushrooms will not turn into Mushtrees during a Full Moon. Raw Green Mushrooms are good for depleting sanity or for lowering enlightenment, which can help the player avoid Gestalt attacks.

## Tips
- Raw Blue Mushrooms are good for regenerating health and hunger, and cooked green caps make up for the lost sanity. So, raw Blue Mushrooms and cooked Green Mushrooms are a

# Snurtle Shell Armor

## Overview
- **Type**: Armor
- **Durability**: 735 hp
- **Damage Absorption**: 60% of physical damage when worn normally, 100% of physical damage when hiding inside
- **Dropped By**: 
  - Snurtle (75%)
  - Ancient Pseudoscience Station (using a Hammer)
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "armorsnurtleshell"
- **Perk**: Absorbs 60% of physical damage (100% inside)

## Description
The Snurtle Shell Armor is a wearable armor that can be dropped by Snurtles. It has 735 hit points and absorbs 60% of physical damage when worn. When the player hides inside the shell (by right-clicking on it in the inventory), it absorbs 100% of physical damage. Hiding inside the shell also absorbs freezing from Deerclops and Blue Hounds, electric shock from Volt Goats, and knocking items out of the inventory from Frogs. Not considering its durability, the Snurtle Shell Armor effectively adds 225 hit points to the average survivor.

## Features
- Works like a Bush Hat, making aggressive mobs not attack the player if they hide before they aggro on them.
- After hiding inside the shell for around 5 seconds, all attackers will lose interest in the player and stop their attacks. This can be used to avoid Hound attacks and Shadow Creatures.

## Trivia
- Unlike other armors which can't block more damage than they have durability left, Snurtle Shell Armor completely negates damage from hits strong enough to destroy it.

## Bugs
- Willow, Wendy, Wigfrid, and Wilba will have their hair clip through the armor, while Webber has spider legs clip through it. This is only a visual issue and doesn't affect gameplay.
- If the player is attacked by Charlie while hiding inside the Shell, they will receive no Health damage but the hurt animation will play, making the player come out of hiding and still take the Sanity damage.

## Overview

Bacon and Eggs is a Meat Food item cooked in the Crock Pot by adding 2.0 units of Eggs and 1.25 units of Meats. It takes 40 seconds to cook.

Adding more than 1 Monster Meat may result in Monster Lasagna, unless 1 Twig is also added; in this case, a Tallbird Egg must be added, as one normal Egg does not provide enough Egg value to create Bacon and Eggs. Adding any Vegetable will result in Pierogi.

Bacon and Eggs is Wilson's favorite food and can be consumed to get an extra 15 Hunger. It is also required to adopt a Friendly Peeper at the Rock Den.

![Wilson holding a Pitchfork to make the tile size visible](Wilson with a Pitchfork and tile digging indicator visible.png)

## Tiles

Tiles appear as highlighted squares when a **Pitchfork** is wielded over any turf. They create the square grid upon which all landform and item placements are based. Various mods may also display this grid. A Tile is the only accurate and visible distance in the game. Tiles are oriented with the diagonals (not the sides) pointing North-South and East-West.

The diagonal of a tile is √2 (or 1.41) times the length of the horizontal or vertical sides. When the term "Tile" is used as a one-dimensional measurement (for distance, in any direction), it refers to the length of a square side, not the diagonal.

Four walls exactly fill any single dimension of a tile (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), so a ¼ Tile could be called a "Wall".

"Screen" is another distance measurement that might refer to (in decreasing order of accuracy):
- The bright circle surrounding the player on the map. This measures about 12 tiles wide (8.5 on the diagonal).
- Loading Radius. This is the area where the game loads and calculates detailed activities of mobs. The entire map is not updated constantly, only the area the player might see and some surrounding areas. This might be anywhere from 12-80 tiles in diameter.
- The width or height of the visible area on any player's device. This varies widely with device shape, orientation, zooming, and various mods, so is not useful for discussion.

See also [Time], the other fundamental world measurement in the game.

## Marble Pillars Description
Marble Pillars are naturally spawning [Structures](#) found around the [Wooden Thing](#) in a [Chess](#) [biome](#) in [Sandbox Mode](#) or in various Chess [biome](#)s in [Adventure Mode](#). Usually, there are [Clockwork Monsters](#) and [Evil Flowers](#) near them. They can be mined with a [Pickaxe](#) or the [Pick/Axe](#) to acquire 2-3 [Marble](#) pieces (2 + 33% chance to get 1 extra). The pickaxe requires 10 hits to break a Marble Pillar down, whereas the Pick/Axe only requires 8. Though it may use a lot of durability off a pickaxe, it is recommended to mine Marble Pillars so the player can make a [Marble Suit](#) for fighting.

## Trivia
- Marble Pillars were introduced in the [A Little Rain Must Fall](#) update.
- Marble Pillars used to spawn around [Maxwell's Door](#) in the old versions of Don't Starve.

# Calibrated Perceiver

![Calibrated Perceiver](Calibrated Perceiver Dropped.png) ![Icon](Calibrated Perceiver.png)

The **Calibrated Perceiver** is an item that can only be obtained by **Winona** with the **Founder's Keepers I** skill. It drops from **Cacheboxes** after fixing or opening them. Cacheboxes can be found by wearing the **Inspectacles**. It cannot be given to other players.

## Usage

The Calibrated Perceiver can be used to scan items and structures that can be prototyped to obtain their respective recipes. The item disappears after one use or when left on the ground for too long. It cannot be used to scan other characters' exclusive items or items that are not prototypable. For example, you cannot scan the **Pick/Axe**, but you can use it to scan an **Opulent Pickaxe**.

Winona with **Founder's Keepers II** skill can use the Calibrated Perceiver to scan **Unstable Transmissions**, which dropped from **Advanced Cacheboxes**. If the Unstable Transmission looks like a dismantled Teleport pad, the player will learn the **Teletransport Station** recipe. If the Unstable Transmission looks like an umbrella, the player will learn the **Portasol** recipe.

## Tips

- One can use it to scan the **Bundling Wrap** from the **Loot Stash** after killing **Klaus**.
- Even though it has the same name and in the canon is the same thing, in the game, you cannot use the Calibrated Perceiver from Moonstorms to scan items.
- Winona can use it to scan some items to save recourses. For example, one **Fish Food** costs 1 **Empty Bottle**, but one Fish Food **Blueprint** costs 5 Empty Bottles. Using Calibrated Perceiver can save 4 Bottles.
- Winona can also scan **Lures** that dropped from Peral's **Bundle of Thanks** or scan **Relics** in ruins.

## Item Infobox
- **Name**: Wooden Potato Thing
- **Image**: Wooden Potato Thing.png
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: `teleportato_sw_potato`

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: Seems like it was made with a purpose in mind.
- **Willow**: Wonder what it does?
- **Wolfgang**: Hello, spuddy.
- **Wendy**: What possible use could this have?
- **WX-78**: INNOVATIVE

- **Choose**: Wilson

The **Wooden Potato Thing** is the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** equivalent to the **Metal Potato Thing** in both **Sandbox Mode** and **Adventure Mode**. It serves the same purpose as the Metal Potato Thing, and is used with the other **Things** on the **Wooden Thing** to create a portal that lets players generate a new **World**, deleting everything except the items in their inventory.

It spawns naturally in the world in its own **Set Piece**. The player will find a **Drying Rack**, a **Fire Pit**, a **Skeleton**, and some **Rocks** atop **Magma Turf**.

As it is an important gameplay Item, it cannot be destroyed or stolen by **Mobs** (e.g. **Krampus**, **Prime Ape**s etc.).

## Prototype Tips
If the player manages to find the Wooden Potato Thing **Set Piece** when starting in a world, this is a rather good place to take shelter. The area around is usually safe from dangers, and can even be "upgraded" to a better base.

## Placeholder Trivia
- The Wooden Potato Thing is a wooden version of **Maxwell's** head.
- The Wooden Potato thing is the reason the **Wooden Platform Thing**, when fully constructed, is more commonly referred to as the 'Teleportato'.

## Description

The **Hollow Stump** is a naturally-spawning object from the **Reign of Giants** DLC, found only in a **Deciduous Forest** Biome. It is a large stump with a hole, with yarn hanging from its branches and a ball of yarn on the side. It is the home of a **Catcoon**.

A Hollow Stump initially starts with 9 Catcoon lives. The life counter decreases every time a Catcoon from the stump is killed, and the Hollow Stump regenerates one Catcoon life every 120 seconds. If a Hollow Stump runs out of lives completely, the stump will go into an "empty" state. Despite appearing to be mostly destroyed, a Hollow Stump in this state will drop the same number of items as a functional one.

Spawned Catcoons wander within 30 tiles radius of their Hollow Stump.

The Hollow Stump has 20 inventory slots. Catcoons will store any item they pick up from the ground into the stump. Players can search the Hollow Stump to retrieve those items, but doing so will aggro the Catcoon.

The Hollow Stump will only drop 2 [[Twigs]] and 2 [[Log]] when destroyed.

An empty Hollow Stump will regenerate after 15-20 days, becoming an inhabited Hollow Stump.

Hammered/Burnt Hollow Stump attempt to regrow in 7.5 days in spring, 15 days in autumn. The regrown Hollow Stump requires an empty space with 3 tiles, within 20 tiles radius of the destroyed Hollow Stump, at least 20 tiles away from any wall or structure.

## Trivia

- **Catcoons** spawning a total of 9 times, as well as the cat having 9 unique "gifts", is a reference to the myth that cats have 9 lives.

## Description

Cave-in Boulders are a special kind of Boulder that can be carried. They can also be mined for rocks using a Pickaxe. The boulders that drop during Cave-ins can be carried, much like Suspicious Marbles, and can even be brought outside the caves. When mined, a Cave-in Boulder drops 2 Rocks with a 40% chance for an extra one, and has a 10% chance to drop 1 Flint.

During an Antlion attack, big boulders will drop on locations close to the players inside caves, damaging them if hit, destroying any Structures nearby, and potentially blocking the way. Like Sinkholes, they can be prevented if the players occasionally give items to the Antlion.

After Shadow Rifts are enabled, boulders also fall during Earthquakes underground. Reinforced Pillars work to prevent these from falling at no extra cost.

Cave-in Boulders are also found on the way from Lunar Grotto to the Ancient Archive.

# Exclusivity: Shipwrecked

## Item Infobox
- **Image**: Hail.png
- **Spoil**: 1 Day
- **Stack**: 40
- **Spawn Code**: "hail_ice"

## Quotes
- **Wolfgang**: "Is cold."
- **Wilson**: "Chilling."
- **Willow**: "Ugh, just melt already."
- **Woodie**: "You think this is cold? How cute."
- **Maxwell**: "Slightly chilly."
- **Wagstaff**: "Let's see if I can find a purpose for this precipitation."
- **Wendy**: "Frozen like my heart."
- **Woodlegs**: "Me timbers is shiverin'!"
- **Wickerbottom**: "Some storms have produced hail the size of cantaloupes."
- **Webber**: "Brrr!"
- **Warly**: "Like icecubes."
- **WX78**: "NATURE IS LAUNCHING AN AIRSTRIKE"
- **Walani**: "From the freezer in the sky."
- **Wigfrid**: "The sky is throwing ice!"
- **Wilba**: "SPIT ICE! SPOUT, RAIN!"
- **Wormwood**: "Cold. Wet"
- **Wheeler**: "Ugh! Hail! It's grounded me more times than I can count."
- **Choose**: WX78

## Hail
Hail is an **Item** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It falls from storms during the **Hurricane Season**. It can be made into **Ice** to restore hunger and health. It must be turned into Ice in order to be used in a crafting or **Crock Pot** recipe.

Like Ice, Hail will never melt when put in an **Ice Box** and will melt much faster when near a fire. Hail can also be used to extinguish **Fire|burning** objects.

Hail is treated as a mineral, and as such **Rock Lobsters** try to eat it and can be convinced to follow the player if given.

### Usage
{{Recipe
| item1=Hail
| count1=4
| result=Ice
| tool=Alchemy Engine}}

### Trivia
- Since the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#December 17, 2015 - Hang Ten Update**, it is possible to turn 4 Hail pieces into 1 Ice. Prior to this update, it was an acceptable substitute for Ice for Crock Pot usage, resulting in easy food that required filler.
- Prior to the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#January 14, 2016 - Eye of the Tiger Shark Update**, Hail was notorious for destroying structures and damaging the player repeatedly, as a bug caused it to be considered as an entity that was still falling, which would normally cause damage.

**Maxwell's Tooth Trap** is a [Trap](#Category:Traps) found only in [Adventure Mode](#Category:Adventure Mode). It is similar to a normal [Tooth Trap](#), though it will trigger if the player and any other [Mobs](#) step on it, dealing 60 damage. It can't be picked up, and it will disappear once activated. They sit on the ground, just like a normal Tooth Trap planted by the player and are easy to see and avoid if they are watched out for.

### Tips
- It is better to lead some friendly [Pig](#)s to the Maxwell's Tooth Trap, as the player can eliminate the trap and get some loot from the Pig at the same time. Leading any aggressive mob for their loot is also an option.

### Trivia
- They share the same [Map](#) icon as normal Tooth Traps.
- Unlike the normal tooth trap's wood construction, Maxwell's Tooth Trap appears to be made of [Thulecite](#).
- Previously, it was difficult to lead [Chester](#) through such minefields, as they would damage him. However, the current Chester model cannot activate traps.
