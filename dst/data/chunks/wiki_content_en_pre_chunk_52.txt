# Character Summary

## Advantages

- **Main article: [Wickerbottom](#)**
  - Can craft all **Science Machine** recipes even without one nearby.
  - Can prototype all **Alchemy Engine** recipes with a **Science Machine**.
  - Can craft **Books**.
  - Has a large **Sanity** pool.

## Disadvantages

- **Main article: [Wickerbottom](#)**
  - Cannot sleep (**Tent**, **Straw Roll**, **Fur Roll**, **Siesta Lean-to**)
  - Suffers extra from **Spoilage**.

# Finding a Home

When settling somewhere you should think about your sanity sources and food management. You already have access to all **Science Machine** recipes, this allows you to delay settling and roam around for a little longer.

- Already being able to craft Science Machine recipes, you have early access to many nice things such as a **Backpack**, allowing you to gather more things while exploring in the first days. But consider that you won't have access to the sanity boost triggered by first prototyping, so you might think of another way to gain sanity.
- Since you cannot sleep, you need a source of sanity other than a **Tent**. Spider dens are a nice source of silk, which can be used to craft clothing that restores sanity. Additionally, **Mushrooms** (Green and Blue) are a nice source of **Sanity**. Before making a base, consider opening **Sink Holes** to have a look in the caves and see if there are any green or blue **Mushtree Forests** nearby. If there are, consider building your base near the **Sink Hole** (some distance away, because **Batilisks** spawn from it).
- Since Wickerbottom can craft all Science Machine recipes, you can get yourself a **Shovel** and dig up **Berry Bushes**, **Grass Tufts** and **Saplings** in the first days, allowing you to make a nice camp quicker, as well as saving time by not doing it sooner rather than later.
- You don't need to get an **Alchemy Engine** in order to craft tier II science recipes, so you might need a little less **Gold Nuggets**, **Logs**, and **Rocks** - instead you can save them in order to craft other things, such as a **Lightning Rod** and/or additional **Chests**.

# Managing Hunger

- Food spoilage cannot be afforded, therefore, try not to grab more than you need and avoid quickly spoiling foods unless you will eat them immediately. Leave **Berries** on their bushes and **Carrots** on the ground for emergencies, because they will not spoil unless picked up. Leave **Koalefant**s and other animals alive until you need them. Do not have any mercy on **Spiders** however, because you need the **Silk**, **Monster meat** doesn't spoil fast and can be used in **Crock Pot** recipes, and **Spiders** respawn fairly quickly.
- Getting an **Ice Box** is a high priority. It will delay the spoilage of your food, as well as your **Mushrooms**, which are equally important, it also stores your **Ice** indefinitely. While you are scouting, look for sources of **Gears**, grab as many as you can.

# Managing Sanity

Managing your **Sanity** is important as **Wickerbottom**, as you cannot jump into a **Tent** like other **Characters**. It is important to note that while insane, killing **Shadow Creatures** will restore a bit of sanity, along with providing the **Nightmare Fuel** to make **Books#Sleepytime_Stories| Sleepytime Stories**. As with other characters, this allows maintaining low sanity without losing control entirely and obtaining **Nightmare Fuel**, which is especially useful for Wickerbottom. To get back to high sanity levels, the players must use worn items or food, due to her inability to sleep.

In **Don't Starve Together**, **Tree/Totally Normal|Totally Normal Trees** will be a useful find early on as their **Living Log**s allow for the creation of **Mushroom Planter**s, a health-friendly way of boosting sanity via **Mushrooms** consumption. **Treeguards** will also drop Living Logs, however, it must be noted that combat should be avoided unless completely necessary since Wickerbottom cannot gain health as easily as other characters.

| Action | Effect | Comment |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Wearing **Top Hat** | +3.3 **Sanity** / min | *Does not spoil* <br> *Requires your head slot which can be a problem* |
| Eating **Cooked Green Cap** | +15 **Sanity**

# Thulecite Fragments

## Overview
Thulecite Fragments are broken pieces of Thulecite which can be used to craft Thulecite, repair a broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station, or repair damaged Thulecite Walls. Six fragments are needed to craft one chunk of Thulecite, and the player must be near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It's some smaller chunks of Thulecite."
- Willow: "This Thulecite crumbled to pieces."
- Wolfgang: "I can smash together to make bigger piece!"
- Wendy: "Fragments of a powerful material."
- WX-78: "THESE COULD BE DEFRAGMENTED TO CREATE A BIGGER PIECE"
- Wickerbottom: "These could be combined to make a bigger piece."
- Woodie: "It's not wood but it'll do."
- Maxwell: "I could combine several piles to make a bigger piece."
- Wagstaff: "Discharging small packets of dark energy."
- Wigfrid: "Lööks like shiny pöpped cörn."
- Webber: "Small bits of fancy rock."
- Walani: "Weird."
- Warly: "A pocketful of thule."
- Woodlegs: "Tastes a might goldy."
- Wilba: "'TAS BEEN TORN ASUNDER"
- Wormwood: "Old rocks"
- Wheeler: "This seems like the kind of thing I'm going to need more of."
- Winona: "Just needs a spit shine."
- Wortox: "Such strength and such shine."
- Wurt: "Bitty bits."
- Walter: "Woby, keep your eyes peeled for any more of these little pieces!"
- Wanda: "Just what I was looking for!"

## Usage
### Crafting Recipes
- **Thulecite**: Combine 6 Thulecite Fragments using a Broken Pseudoscience Station.
- **Cursed Rounds**: Combine Thulecite Fragments with Nightmare Fuel using a Broken Pseudoscience Station (Walter).
- **Time Pieces**: Combine 8 Thulecite Fragments, Clockmaker's Tools, and 2 Nightmare Fuel using a Broken Pseudoscience Station (Wanda).
- **Premier Gardeneer Hat**: Combine 4 Thulecite Fragments, 1 Gardeneer Hat, and 1 Purple Gem using a Broken Pseudoscience Station.
- **Ancient Stonework**: Combine Thulecite Fragments with Moon Rock using a Blueprint (rare).

### Tips
- If you need to turn Thulecite into fragments, craft walls and hammer them. 1 Thulecite becomes 6 walls which yield 1 fragment each, making this process completely reversible at the minor cost of hammer durability.

## Trivia
- Thulecite Fragments were added in "A Moderately Friendly Update".

## Description
The Magma Golem is an allied mob that assists players in the [[The Forge]] event. It can be spawned using the [[The Forge#Weapons|Tome of Beckoning]] and does 25 damage. It will stay for a period of time, then despawn. The Magma Golem will also despawn immediately after taking any damage. The Magma Golem will auto attack any enemy within its range. If no enemy is within range, it will await for its summoner to attack something and proceed to attack, even if it's out of range a Magma Golem will attempt to attack that target. They won't switch targets until its current one dies or goes too far. Wickerbottom's empowered spell makes the golem more powerful: the elemental deals 38 damage per shot.

## Trivia
- The Magma Golem's spawn code is <code>"lavaarena_elemental"</code>. However, it's impossible to spawn a Magma Golem in the regular game, while the [[Console]] is not available at all on The Forge servers.

# Wet Goop

![Wet Goop Dropped](Wet Goop Dropped.png)

**Wet Goop** is a **Food** item that results from invalid recipes cooked in the **Crock Pot**, is left from a **Hatching Tallbird Egg** that has remained cold for too long, or is hacked up by neutral **Catcoon**s. It takes 10 seconds to cook and generally has no effects on most characters, although it will affect **Warly** due to his refined palate.

## Properties

- **Wanda:** "I never claimed to be good at cooking!"

## Uses

- **Bait for Pigs:** Wet Goop attracts hungry **Pig**s and can be used to bait them into **Tooth Trap** meat farms. However, giving it to a Pig will neither make it friendly nor cause it to produce **Manure**.
- **Bait in Traps:** Wet Goop can also be used as bait in traps, but it will not attract most animals.
- **Fertilizer:** Wet Goop can be a source of **Rot** for **fertilizing**, but there are other edibles that take less time to spoil or fewer resources to obtain.

## Downloadable Content

The **Reign of Giants** DLC introduced **Wetness**, adding a modifier for items, objects, and mobs soaked by **rain**. Most consumables exposed to too much rain will have the "Soggy" title added before their names until they dry off, but Wet Goop will become "Very Wet Goop". Like all wet food, Very Wet Goop will spoil 30% faster.

## Example Recipes

1. **Crock Pot Recipe**

**Scrapbook Info**: It's not food fit for a person.

Amberosia is a [Food] Item exclusive to 'Don't Starve Together', introduced in 'Return of Them'. It can be cooked in a Crock Pot with 1 Collected Dust and any 3 fillers. It has the highest priority of any Crock Pot dish in the game: attempting to use Collected Dust with any recipe will always result in Amberosia.

Amberosia cannot be eaten by the player. Dust Moths fed Amberosia will ornate their Tidy Hidey-Holes with Thulecite, which can then be mined for 3-7 Thulecite Fragments and even 1 full Thulecite with 1% chance. This offers a renewable, albeit slow source of Thulecite without the need to reset the Ruins.

Since there are no restrictions on what the fillers can be, it is advised to use cheap items, like Twigs.

## Recipe
| Item | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Collected Dust | 1 |
| Filler | 3 |

**Tool**: Crock Pot  
**Result**: Amberosia

## Examples
| Item | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Collected Dust | 1 |
| Twigs | 3 |

**Tool**: Crock Pot  
**Result**: Amberosia

## Trivia
- Amberosia was introduced in the 'Return of Them#Forgotten Knowledge' update.
- The name "Amberosia" is a portmanteau of "Amber" and "Ambrosia".
- Amberosia is designed after a [Meringue](https://wikipedia:Meringue), as indicated by its internal name.

# The Key to the City and Executive Hammer: Building Your Hamlet

The Key to the City and Executive Hammer are exclusive items that can only be acquired through giving royal trinkets to the Pig Queen. The Key unlocks the City Planning Tab, a high-end crafting tab similar to the ancient or volcanic tab. The executive hammer can permanently destroy structures from the city planning tab and return half the resources used to build it. This guide will focus on how to effectively build your own hamlet using these items and how to effectively reap the most benefits.

## Gathering Trinkets

The first step to begin building your city is to gather two royal trinkets to gift to the Pig Queen for Royal Gallery Keys. The best way to do this is to kill a single hippopotamoose for its antler and kill one or two platypines for their quills and make a bird whistle. Using the bird whistle, summon the BFB and collect the Regal Scepter from the island before heading back to your first island. Then, when traveling to the palace island, collect the jeweled truffle before exiting and making your way to the palace. Redeem both trinkets with the Pig Queen and collect the Key to the City and Executive Hammer. Alternatively, if you cannot acquire two trinkets, simply collect one and get just the Key.

## Gathering Resources

Once you have the tools you need for making your hamlet, you will need the resources to build before you start building. All shops require 4 boards and 4 pig skin, as well as additional items specific to the shop. If you want, you could also build a slanty shanty for your own town, giving yourself a place to live. This will require cut stone instead of pig skin, and will also require 30 oincs, so you will need to spend some time in one of the towns accumulating riches.

You can of course gather boards by crafting them, but you can also gather boards by hammering the counter in a pig shop. Simply wait in the shop until night or offer the trader an item they won't accept. After a few seconds, they will leave their station, allowing you to hammer the counter. This does not anger or provoke any pigs, and the shop will still work just as fine. Pig skin can be collected by killing pigs, but if that does not appeal to you, you could always collect Pig skin? from vampire bats. If you find yourself all out of options, you could use the Executive Hammer to destroy existing shops or houses to collect the necessary resources. Just remember that doing so will provoke any Royal Guards nearby.

Before you begin the build phase, consider a space to place your hamlet. The beginning island and palace island both contain pig towns, so building on one of those may be annoying if your build space is limited by that of one of the other towns. Remember that you will also want to keep your citizens safe from harm, so avoid building it near places pigs will come into harm, such as the fountain of youth, or the deep rainforest.

## Buildings to Prioritise

First, you will want to build a city hall. This means that you can build town houses and pigs will pay tax every eight days. This can be a reliable way to earn money, however know that this method is very slow at first until you can accumulate lots of pig skin. However, if you already have more preferred ways of earning money, you can skip this step and just build town houses for more pig traders. Also, if you wish to have a building to base in, make a slanty shanty close to points of interest, such as shops. Once you have a town hall built, it is no longer necessary to enter it, so you may build points of interest further away from it. Also, you will definitely want to build all of your shops close to each other and your base for easy shopping.

1. **Pigg and Pigglet's General Store**: This is useful because it can be crafted at a relatively cheap price and is the only source of cloth, other than hammering the deflated balloon at the start of the game. It can also sell flint, which is useful in a hamlet world where boulders are rare and flint cannot be found on the ground.
2. **The Boar's Tusk Weapon Shop**: Another great shop, as it is easy to craft and has good weapons for sale that cannot be gathered anywhere else, such as coconades and tooth traps. It also can occasionally sell a cutlass supreme, a weapon with as much damage as a dark sword but with more durability and no sanity drain.
3. **Mineral Exchange**: Whilst you can not buy items, this shop can be useful for making tenpiece and centapiece oincs for more compact storage. It can also be used as an easy source of gold.
4. **The Flying Pig Arcane Shop**: Easy enough to craft,

# Guide for Surviving the First Few Days in Spring or Autumn in Reign of Giants

This guide is intended for players having trouble surviving the first few days of **Spring** or **Autumn** in **Reign of Giants** (hereby known as RoG). This is **NOT** a full-blown survival guide. It is merely a guide showing how to set up a base in Spring or Autumn in RoG.

## Part 1: Starting in Spring

Let's say that you created a new world and BAM! The world is a shade of green and you realize your world started in spring. NEVER FEAR! Spring is easy to survive if you have the right tools and the right mindset.

### The First Few Days

During your first days there are several things you must accomplish. First, you must gather as much **grass**, **twigs**, **flint**, and **petals** as possible during the day. After you gather those, craft a **Pretty Parasol** and a **Straw Hat**. That should protect you relatively well from the **rain**. Day is very short and the dusks are long in Spring. Continue gathering and exploring. When night approaches, you have two choices. If it is not raining, you can craft several **torches** and keep exploring. If it is, make a campfire, preferably near either trees or boulders so you don't waste time. If it's still raining equip the parasol and straw hat, and wait out the rains. After the night is over, begin exploring yet again. Explore for at least 3 days, uncovering as much of the map as possible. This will help when selecting a base location.

### Setting Up The Base

When you have uncovered a good portion of the map, it is time to start looking for a good base location. The place you are looking for is a grassland with either **frog ponds** or a **swamp** nearby. Why? Well, since **Rabbit Holes** close during spring, the ways of getting food are slightly limited. As such, **trapping** frogs and/or fishing is a great way to gather food during spring.

### Tips

- Make a small base, you will thank me later. During **Summer**, things can combust by the pure heat of the day. In a small base, these fires are easy to reach and take care of.
- If playing as **Wickerbottom**, you can kill a few **spiders** and demolish a **pig house** to get the materials for an **Umbrella**. Since she can craft things on the science machine level, the umbrella can be made instantly.
- If you can find **Ice**, don't gather it until you have an **Icebox**. It will spoil if it is not in an icebox.
- Avoid being near **Bees** and **Beefalo** as they are hostile season-long.

## Part 2: Starting in Autumn

So let's say your world generator went the opposite way and started your world in autumn. Autumn is actually much easier to survive than spring. However, there are still many things that can (and will) kill you if you are not careful.

### The First Few Days

During the first few days, exploration is key. However, you want to make sure that you have the resources needed for exploration. You need about 40 grass, 40 twigs, 10 **Flint**, some food, and exactly 12 **Petals**. Craft a **Garland** with the petals. Then, EXPLORE! Craft torches to keep moving during the night. Explore for about 3 days, stopping only to eat. If you have a good handle on the game I would **strongly** recommend scouting out the entire edge of your map, this gives you a much better overview of where to start a base and where the key resources are. Ideally you can do this in 10 days on a medium map.

### Setting Up The Base

Your base is not the same one you created for spring. I will explain that later. Now, you need to be on the lookout for a relatively large **Savannah** **biome**. You are looking for a savannah with some **Beefalo** and about 5 rabbit holes in a close proximity. Your base should be situated about 3 screens away from the beefalo and right in the middle of a cluster of rabbit holes. You will get food by trapping rabbits. I found that 4-5 rabbit holes are needed for daily sustenance. (If you feel the need to trap more rabbits, then by all means do so.) You can also hunt beefalo for **Meat** and for the materials to make a **Beefalo Hat**.

### Tips

- Make **drying racks**

- **Wolfgang**: Step stones.
- **Wendy**: It's just ground.
- **WX-78**: GROUND PARTS
- **Wickerbottom**: The ground. You step on it.
- **Woodie**: Just some ground, eh?
- **Maxwell**: It appears to be some turf.

- **Choose**: Wilson

**Ashy Turf** is one of the **Turf** **items** that appears in the **Shipwrecked** DLC, acquired by digging **Volcano** tiles with a **Pitchfork**. Like other **Turfs**, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as **Fire#Fuel|fuel**.

**Plants** like **Berry Bush**es, **Grass Tuft**s, **Saplings**, **Spiky Bush**es, **Bamboo Root**s, **Viney Bush Root**s, **Coconut**s, and **Jungle Tree Seed**s cannot be planted on these Turfs. **Elephant Cacti** and **Coffee Plant**s can be planted on these turfs.

**Lureplant**s can be planted on this Turf, but **Eyeplant**s cannot spawn, so it is great for Lureplant farms while not spending any more resources than those used to craft the Pitchfork.

Floods can spawn on this turf, but this is not seen unless taken out of the volcano, since **Flooding** does not happen there.

When placed on the **Surface World** and the area is large enough, Toucans are the only **Birds** that will spawn and land on these turfs. During **Hurricane Season**, there are no birds that spawn and land on these turfs.

# Shadow Pieces

The **Shadow Pieces** are a group of shadow-themed hostile mobs exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. They are based on the **Clockwork Knight**, **Clockwork Bishop**, and **Clockwork Rook**. With exception of the Shadow Knight, they have attack patterns completely different from the Mobs they are based on.

They will spawn after a **Chess Piece** corresponding to each creature is **hammered** down during a **New Moon**, or when a corresponding **Marble Sculpture** is **mined** during a New Moon. 

All Chess Pieces and Marble Sculptures within 15 units of a Shadow Piece will break and spawn their respective Shadow Pieces (even if the Chess Piece is still on the **Potter's Wheel**). Hence, when any one of multiple shaking Chess Pieces is hammered, all other nearby Chess Pieces will instantly break and spawn their Shadow Pieces. This also happens if a Shadow Piece is near a non-shaking Chess Piece, at any time of day, regardless of the phase of the moon. 

Characters will notice the shaking of the sculpture if it's examined, but Shadow Pieces themselves cannot be examined, which is similar to the ordinary Shadow Creatures.

They have the unique ability to level up when a different Piece of the same level as them or higher is killed nearby. For example: If a level 1 Shadow Rook is killed, all the level 1 Knights and Bishops in the proximity will become level 2, and the same with killing a remaining level 2 for the last to become level 3. 

## Behavior

- **Shadow Rook**: Will not destroy structures but can damage walls. Instead of charging at the player, it will teleport right behind them and attempt a melee attack.
- **Shadow Bishop**: Will turn into a swarm of shadow bats that will damage the player that stays within their range, much like the Sporecloud from Toadstool.
- **Shadow Knight**: Will still attempt to do a melee attack, although its attack period is massively longer. More effort is needed to kite these as the Shadow Knight's range is quite large, and it is significantly faster.

## Mechanics

Shadow Pieces have three levels, each significantly stronger than the previous. The leveling up of Shadow Pieces is best illustrated with an example.

A Shadow Knight, for instance, keeps track of whether or not it has witnessed the defeat of a Shadow Rook and a Shadow Bishop. The first time that a Shadow Rook is killed within 25 units of the Knight, it will level up; the same happens the first time a Shadow Bishop is killed near it. A Shadow Piece will never level up from the death of another Shadow Piece of the same type. Consequently, to kill a Shadow Piece of level 3, which is necessary to get the Shadow Atrium, it is necessary to have at least one Piece of each type.

## Tips

- **Pigs** can become scared of the Shadow Pieces (similar to how they act during dusk), seemingly when the shadow pieces are about to attack. The same effect happens to Bunnymen and Spiders.
- None of the Pieces can be dodged in their third phase, unless the player:
  - Has speed boosts or a Beefalo.
  - Teleports with The Lazy Explorer or with Wortox's Soul Hop.
  - Is playing Wanda and uses a Backstep Watch.
- The Shadow Rook's slow attack period allows the player to use the Bone Armor's protection to block every attack if the armor is fueled, even in the third stage, allowing an easy kill if chosen as the last piece fought. (The previous kills will have dropped Nightmare Fuel to fuel the Bone Armor, as well.)
- The Shadow Pieces are not true shadow or nightmare creatures, as they can damage and be attacked by other mobs. They do still cost less durability when attacked with a Glass Cutter.
- Killing a level 3 rook and its companions takes either 200% or 199% of a Dark Sword, depending on the order of killing.
- The Shadow Bishop (in any level) cannot deal any damage to Maxwell's duelist nor stun it.
- They are invulnerable as they're leveling up.

## Trivia

- Since Level 2 and 3 Shadow Pieces receive the "epic" tag when leveling up, they are actually considered boss mobs in the code. Because they're boss mobs, when a Level 2 or Level 3 Shadow Piece is being fought, the same boss music will play as when fighting the Ancient Guardian.

## Bugs

- The Shadow Knight can become stuck/frozen if attacked by multiple enemies at once in the third phase, and will not come unstuck, leaving it an easy kill.

- Choose: Maxwell

The Malbatross is a Boss Mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them.

## Deep Bass Shoal Map Icon
Only 25% of the Deep Bass shoals with a map icon can spawn the Malbatross when visited. After 3 days, the Malbatross despawns and again, 50% of the Deep Bass shoals are randomly selected to spawn the Malbatross. The Malbatross also has a 30% chance to spawn when a player hooks a Deep Bass. The Malbatross respawns 5 to 15 days after dying.

Upon death, the Malbatross drops 7 Meats, 2 Blue Gems plus 30% to get one extra, 5% of a Yellow Gem, one Malbatross Bill, 3 Malbatross Feathers plus two times 30% to get one extra plus 24 minus the amount spawned by hitting the Malbatross.

## Behavior
The Malbatross is neutral towards players. It does attack hostile mobs that come near it. Fishing deep bass in the shoal when the Malbatross spawns in will cause it to become aggressive.

When not fighting, it moves around and dives to catch Ocean Fishes, creating a circle of waves. Waves will push away a Float Platforms and apply 9 Wetness to player.

The normal attack of the Malbatross deals 75 damage to players and 150 to Mobs. If the Malbatross is over a float platform, the attack also does 5 damage to the float platform and pushes it away. If the Malbatross is over the Ocean the attack also creates 3 waves. Each hit on the Malbatross can drop up to 4 Malbatross Feathers, each feather having a 5% chance of dropping.

When the Malbatross' health goes below 66%, it will dive and run away from the player, creating a circle of waves. When the Malbatross' health goes below 33%, it can swoop over the player, destroying every Mast in its wake. Each Mast destroyed spawns 3 Malbatross Feathers plus two times 30% to get one extra.

## Tips
- If the player wishes to deliberately hunt down Malbatross, using an Ocean Trawler with Monster Meat/other Meats as bait over a Deep Bass Shoal almost instantly spawns it.
- Keeping the float platform's anchored is strongly recommended, so that Malbatross has substantially more trouble pushing the vessel around.
- Ensuring Malbatross stays within melee range is the key to winning the fight.
  - Hitting Malbatross 5-6 times before running to the other side of the float platform will generally keep it within range, without it damaging the player with its normal attack in the process.
  - In addition to the player's melee weapons, a Pan Flute or enough Blow Darts is recommended for hitting the Malbatross at a range,

## Coffee
Coffee is a [Crock Pot](#) recipe introduced in the [Don't Starve: Shipwrecked](#) DLC. It is made by combining 3 [Roasted Coffee Beans](#) and 1 [Dairy](#), [Sweetener](#), or a fourth Roasted Coffee Bean.

Coffee provides a movement speed increase of 5 for half a [Day](#) (4 real minutes). For characters with no other speed buffs, the base speed is 6, therefore, this increment translates to the character moving about 83% faster. The speed buff also applies while on a [Boats](#) or while using a [Walking Cane](#) or a [Sleek Hat](#), stacking their effects while equipped.

## Prerequisites
- Requires: [Roasted Coffee Beans](#)
- Optional: [Dairy](#) or [Sweetener](#)

## Recipe
| Item      | Count | Tool    | Result | Note                     |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|--------------------------|
| Cooked Coffee Beans | 3    | Crock Pot | Coffee | Filler must be Roasted Coffee Beans, Dairy, or Sweetener. |

## Examples
| Item      | Count | Tool    | Result |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| Cooked Coffee Beans | 3    | Crock Pot | Coffee |
| Cooked Coffee Beans | 3    | Crock Pot | Coffee |
| Butter   | 1    | Crock Pot | Coffee |
| Honey   | 1    | Crock Pot | Coffee |

## Trivia
- Coffee was introduced in the [Wilbur Vs. the Volcano](#) update.
- Mobs that consume Coffee (or Roasted Coffee Beans) will also gain the extra movement speed.
- The loss of Sanity when drinking Coffee may be a reference to the collateral effect of tachycardia and general sense of anxiety when people get addicted to it.

![Save](Save.png "Save.png"){:height="220px"}
> **"A well deserved rest, no doubt."** - Wickerbottom

## Saving

Saving is an integral mechanic of **Don't Starve**, allowing the player to save and quit at any point during the game. The game also automatically saves at random intervals, typically once a game **day**. If the player dies and possesses a **resurrection item**, the game will automatically save before revival.

### Death and Resurrection

- If the player dies without resurrection items and is not playing in **Adventure Mode**, the save file will be deleted.
- In **Adventure Mode**, progress is lost, and the player respawns in front of **Maxwell's Door** without penalty.
- Players can delete save files from the slot selection menu, but this will not earn any **Experience**.

### Save Files

There are four save files available in **Don't Starve** (five with the **Reign of Giants** DLC). Players can choose a **character**, customize the world, and then start playing. For world customization details, [click here](World Customization).

Each save slot displays:
- Character image
- World number
- World type (Survival Mode, Adventure Mode, Caves, or Ruins)
- Number of days survived

Deaths are recorded in the **Morgue**, regardless of permanence.

### Save File Locations

- **Windows:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\{unique ID}\{219740}\remote\`

### Rollback Feature

A new feature in **Don't Starve Together** allows the host or an administrator to instantly revert the current world to a previous save, useful for undoing unwanted changes and combating griefing. The game keeps the last five saves, allowing a maximum rollback of five days.

## {{Notice}}
![Hound](Hound.png) This guide is full of **spoilers!** (duh)

> With its unique mechanics, seasonal challenges, and abundance of mobs **Don't Starve: Hamlet** is considered a challenging yet throughly enjoyable DLC. While many useful guides and tutorials can be found online, I resorted to assembling my own here in an effort to give back to a community that has helped me a lot while navigating the game. It is a work in progress and I thank you for your patience. Bear in mind that this article is a guide and therefore written from a subjective point of view. **This guide is meant for everyone new to Don't Starve: Hamlet, whether you've played another **Don't Starve** game before or not.** For more information about how Hamlet, please refer to **Don't Starve: Hamlet** and the numerous and much useful articles on the Don't Starve Wiki.gg.

## Introduction to Don't Starve: Hamlet

### The bare basics
**In **Don't Starve**, the world is your oyster - a very dangerous one, that is.** In **Don't Starve: Hamlet**, as well as in the other **DLC**<nowiki/>s and the base game, players are free to explore and interact with the world as they please, with no established route or course of action besides each player's interests and goals. **The Constant** is a strange dimension where much can be learnt and discovered with little or no instruction from the game as to how, when, or even why to do so, but as you dive in the **Don't Starve** universe you will start piecing together through experience a very large and fascinating picture.

But let's focus on staying alive first, because in order to progress in this universe, you'll obviously have to - and in **Don't Starve**, **death** is final, unless you find the means to unnaturally resurrect yourself. There are three aspects of yourself you'll have to mind in order to survive, and you can keep watch of them in your top right screen: **Hunger**, **Health**, and **Sanity**. You will suffer damage to all three of them as you roam the world of Hamlet and encounter its numerous perils. The first, and most obvious of all, is the threat of starvation; since your spawn in the game your **Hunger** will progressively drain until, yes, you starve, which will cause your **Health** to drop to death. Your **Health** will also be affected by taking damage from aggresive creatures and harmful items in a wide arrange of ways you'll have to learn to counteract and prevent. Similarly to your health, your **Sanity** will also be affected in a variety of ways until you slowly become insane. While this does not directly drain your health, the monsters that'll appear once you go insane will, as does your next most obvious concern in this game: **Day-Night Cycle|darkness**. Being in the dark is very dangerous in Don't Starve, folks, as it not only drains your Sanity, but the terrible **Charlie|creatures** that inhabit it will make a target of your character once your screen goes black.

As you progress in the game, you will learn to effectively and efficiently manage these three stats of your character so they become less of a concern and you become able to focus on exploration; for the world of **Don't Starve: Hamlet** is a dangerous one, but it is also full of useful resources that will allow you to survive and thrive. This leads us to the very important mechanic of **crafting**. Your left screen tab of crafting will allow you to build numerous tools and structures to help you move forward, so collecting the necessary resources and learning the recipes needed to prototype these items will also be a priority of yours when playing **Don't Starve: Hamlet**. **So, basically,** **you will be exploring, collecting, crafting and, eventually, fighting your way through this game!**

### The world of Hamlet
Exotic, tropical and dangerous, the world of Hamlet is one full of jungles, ancient civilizations and treasures.

> "I envy his escape." - Wendy

## Death
Death is one of the key elements in the game. Upon death, the player drops all their carried inventory except **Wanda** who will keep all her watches and **Winona** who will keep all items if she was carrying a **Fragile Rose**.

All deaths, permanent or otherwise, are recorded in the **Morgue**.

When a player dies, a death announcement will appear in chat. The message will change depending on the character's gender, cause of death and player name, e.g. "*Player Name* was killed by *Cause of Death*. *He/She/They* became a spooky ghost!". A **Skeleton** spawns at the spot where the death has occurred.

If all players in a world are dead and no one revives within 120 seconds, the world will be lost permanently.

### Invulnerability

- Activation of the following in-game portals will make characters invincible during the transition: **Worm Hole**, **Sinkhole**.
- Characters who are still in the reviving animation.

### Causes of Death
- **Starving** 
- Being hit by a **Mob** directly, such as a **Hound**, **Pig**, **Tentacle**, etc.
- Being hit by **Charlie** in pitch black darkness (labeled as Darkness with any character except for Maxwell, who will label it as Charlie)
- **Burning**
- **Overheating**
- **Freezing**
- Being struck by **Lightning**
- Being hit by a returning **Boomerang**
- Picking a spiky plant, e.g. **Spiky Bush**, **Rose**, **Cactus**
- Eating damaging **Food** such as **Monster Meat**, **Raw Red Mushrooms**, **Raw Durian**, or **Monster Lasagna**
- Eating a **Grim Galette** while wearing a **Nightmare Amulet** or **Bone Helm**
- Being hit by a **Gunpowder** explosion
- Being hit by falling **Rocks** and other debris from **Earthquakes** in **Caves**
- Popping **Wes's** **Balloons** close to the character
- Being hit by another player in a world with **PvP** turned on
- Taking damage from **Acid Rain**

#### Character-specific
- Being damaged by Wetness as **WX-78**
- Reaching age 80 as **Wanda**

### Resurrection
Unlike in **Don't Starve**, players are usually not resurrected automatically if a resurrection item is present in the world or in their inventory. Instead, they are turned into **Ghost Characters** in Survival or Endless **Mode**, which can revive themselves by:

- haunting the **Florid Postern** in Endless or Relaxed **Mode**.
- haunting a **Life Giving Amulet**
- haunting a **Touch Stone**
- activating an attuned **Meat Effigy**
- or haunting a **Second Chance Watch** as **Wanda**.

Players can also be revived by another player using:

- a **Telltale Heart**
- or a Second Chance Watch (only by **Wanda**).

**Winona** is automatically revived if she dies with a **Fragile Rose** in her inventory.

Most items are destroyed when they are used to revive a player and cannot be used again.

In Wilderness Mode, the player is despawned upon death and goes back to Character select screen, resetting all the progress the one had.

#### Penalty
After revival, the player has 2/3 of max **Hunger**, 1/2 of max **Sanity**, 50**Hp**.

When the player is revived by the Telltale Heart or Florid Postern, the maximum Health of the player will get reduced by 25% that can be recovered by using **Booster Shot**.

This Penalty is the default in Survival and Endless mode, but the player can choose to turn it on or off in World Settings.

### Tips
Choosing that you must pick another survivor in the world settings can be used as a way to farm endless resources. For example, you can pick **Maxwell**, who starts with his **Codex Umbra** and 6 **Nightmare Fuel**, and drop his items on the ground. Then either find a way to die normally or wait for darkness. Once dead, choose any survivor and you will have the Nightmare Fuel. Can be repeated. Works with almost every survivor.

### Trivia
* Death cries were changed in **The End of The Beginning** update. Now all characters have their own death cry, except Wes, who does not make any noise at all. Before

# Hound Attack Survival Guide

*By [[User:Skyte100|Skyte100]], [[User:Yorien|Yorien]] and various wikia contributors*

---

## Intro
![Typical unprepared you](I%20never%20asked%20for%20this.jpg){: width="220" height="220"}
Hound attacks can be very dangerous for players caught off-guard. Without proper defense and offense, one can easily be overwhelmed, and without a solid backup, the world will be lost. This instructional page will provide basic and advanced tactics to help players survive a Hound Wave.

## Early Attack Tips
There are several warnings that occur when a Hound attack is imminent.

- You will begin to hear barking and growling that becomes louder and more frequent as they get closer.
- Your character will say phrases like, "*Did you hear that?*", to alert you. (See character quotes [here](Hound#Warning).)

On default settings, the first attack will consist of 2 Hounds and you will have 2 minutes before the Hounds appear. Hound attacks will not occur until at least Day 6.

Once you hear these warnings, you should begin to prepare. There are several ways to fight hounds depending on your base camp location, nearby monsters, and biome.

Later attacks will have more hounds, shorter warning periods, and occur more frequently. A table of spawning times, numbers, and chances of Red Hounds or Blue Hounds spawning can be found [here](Hound#Hound%20attacks%20in%20sandbox%20mode).

## Solutions to Hound Attacks
### Self Defense
- Equip or make a [Spear]. It takes 5 hits to kill them. If you can obtain a [Tentacle Spike], it takes only 3 hits.
- Get a defensive item such as a [Log Suit] or a [Football Helmet]. Normal Hounds deal 20 damage so armor is recommended. If you don't have the materials for a Log Suit, a [Grass Suit] will be sufficient for the first hound waves.
- If it is nearing night you should make a fire in advance. Nothing's worse than forgetting about [Charlie (Night Monster)]. Larger fire means more room to fight them.
- Hounds are very easy to kite; allowing the player to move out of their attack radius before they finish their attack animation, unless you're being attacked from many sides. At the same time you may avoid all of the hounds attacks just by staying in motion.
- Hounds do not have any kiting mechanic themselves; after every attack they stay for some seconds in place, either barking or doing nothing. You may use that time between attacks to land one or two hits and then run away once their attack timer is reset.
- This option is mainly used till day 50, when the number of hounds per wave is still manageable (3-4 hounds at most). Hound waves will keep increasing in numbers and become progressively more difficult (until maxing at 7-12 per wave past day 100) so a lone approach is not recommended after this point.

### Pig Villages
- You can run to a [Pig Village] or build a big enough one near your base camp since pigs will attack most nearby monsters on sight (including [Spiders] and [Treeguards]); you may deconstruct lone [Pig Houses] commonly located in forest Biomes and get half of the needed materials to build a new one near your base camp. It's best to leave pre-generated pig villages alone since you may use them as secondary bases when exploring away from your camp. Also, deconstructing [Pig Head]s (near [Touch Stone]s and [Merm] villages) is another way to get some easy [Pig Skin].
- Take note that pigs run to their houses at dusk, but any pig already engaged in combat will stay outside until no more enemies are at range. Some care must be taken at full moon nights since pigs will transform into [Werepigs] if caught outside when the time cycle changes to night-time. While you're completely safe near pig villages and lone houses (since pigs will always head home at dusk and won't exit until dawn, even if it's a full moon night), homeless pigs (i.e. pigs whose home you have deconstructed but are still alive in the map) and pigs engaged in a long enough battle that lasts for the entire dusk may transform (still, a pig engaged in a battle of that magnitude, will be severely wounded by that time).
- A killed pig will re-spawn after three days as long as his house is left intact.

### Beefalo Herds
- You may kite the hounds near a [Beefalo] herd and wait till a hound bites one of them

The **Prime Mate** is a **Mob** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **The Curse of Moon Quay** update.

A Prime Mate appears as part of a **Pirate raid**, wielding a **Battle Paddle** which it uses to move the boat. On death, it will drop 1-2 **Tree Jams**, Battle Paddle, a **Captain's Tricorn**, a **Pirate Map**, a **Meat**, an **Accursed Trinket**, and a **Banana Shake** (20% chance).

### Behavior
The Prime Mate is the captain of a pirate crew that raids the player's boat. He wears a Captain's Tricorn hat on his head, which allows the **Pirate Sloop** to take half the damage from collisions and reduces the speed of the boat's **durability** loss by half.

Prime Mates will not let anyone (except for Monkeys) step on their boat, attacking any intruders that step on it. If all the **Powder Monkeys** have been killed, the Prime Mate will row the boat and run away.

When the Pirate Sloop has a leak, the Prime Mate can fix it with **Tree Jam**, up to 2 times. Once the boat is about to sink and the boat is near land, Prime Mates will attempt to jump on land. Prime Mates are passive while on land. It will wander around but will not attack when players get close. If nowhere to escape, the Prime Mate will jump into water and drop all its loot without the **Accursed Trinket**.

### Tips
- The **Pirate Map** is in its inventory and will drop when the Prime Mates are attacked by **Cutless** or **Frogs**.

### Trivia
- The name "Prime Mate" is a pun on the word "primate", and possibly on the term **first mate**, a position on ship crews.

## Description
The Night Light is a **Magic** Structure that lights the night with your dreams. It can be crafted using a Prestihatitator and requires 8 Gold Nuggets, 2 Nightmare Fuel, and 1 Red Gem.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It gives off a spooky light."
- Willow: "It's like fire, but purple!"
- Wolfgang: "Is strange glow."
- Wendy: "Eerie and yet beautiful."
- WX78: "UNKNOWN LIGHT SOURCE"
- Wickerbottom: "Curiously luminescent."
- Woodie: "What kind of darkness is that?"
- Maxwell: "It burns with a beautiful glow."
- Wigfrid: "I'm more comfortable around my own fire."
- Webber: "It makes our skin crawl."
- Warly: "And I thought fluorescent tubes were a bad invention!"
- Wormwood: "Glowy"
- Winona: "Creepy to the core."
- Wortox: "Goodness gracious, what excellent decorations!"
- Wurt: "Creepy light."
- Walter: "It really adds to the atmosphere."
- Wanda: "This feels like a trick."

## Shadow Queen's Blessing
When Winona selects the **Shadow Seeker II** Insight skill, dying while holding a **Fragile Rose** will automatically have her be **resurrected** at a random Night Light. If there are no built Night Lights, Charlie will instead revive Winona at her **Florid Postern**.

## Tips
Night Lights can be a useful light source in **Caves** and **Ruins**, where there is an abundance of Nightmare Fuel. It also has niche use on **Maxwell**, as it can make it easier for him to go insane due to his constant sanity regeneration, and his dependence on Nightmare Fuel makes it more likely for him to have spare amounts to fuel the Night Light. Otherwise, it has no use on the surface where Nightmare Fuel is not as plentiful and materials to fuel other fires are.

## Trivia
- The Night Light was added in the **Insanity!** update.
- The Night Light used to share its model with **Maxwell's Light** in the older versions of **Don't Starve**.
- The gem on the Night Light has five corners. However, the red gem used to build it only has four.

# Siesta Lean-to

## Overview
The **Siesta Lean-to** is a craftable **Structure** in the game. It requires **2 Silk**, **4 Boards**, and **3 Rope** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.

## Crafting Details
- **Image**: Siesta Lean-to Build.png
- **Icon**: Siesta Lean-to.png
- **Spawn Code**: "siestahut"
- **Ingredients**: 
  - **Silk**: 2
  - **Boards**: 4
  - **Rope**: 3
- **Healing Rate**: +2/second
- **Hunger Depletion Rate**: -0.33/second
- **Sanity Bonus**: +1/second
- **Tier**: 2
- **Tool**: Can be **Hammered** (pic|32|Hammer)
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Durability**: 15 uses
- **Perk**: Lowers **Temperature** and raises **Sanity** and **Health** at the expense of **Hunger**

## Description
Escape the heat to restore sanity. The Siesta Lean-to has been altered to heal over time, similar to the Tent. While sleeping in the lean-to, players regenerate 1 Sanity/sec & 2 Health/sec at the cost of a mere 0.33 Hunger/sec. It also reduces **Wetness** by 1/sec and lowers **Body Temperature** by 1/sec as long as the player's temperature is greater than 40. All outside temperature sources are ignored, so the player's temperature will not decrease if it is below 40.

## Incompatibilities
**Wickerbottom** cannot use the Siesta Lean-to due to her insomnia.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: A nice place for an afternoon rest out of the heat.
- **Willow**: They taught us how to make these in Girl Scouts.
- **Wolfgang**: Napping place.
- **Wendy**: A siesta is but a preview of death.
- **WX-78**: I CAN HIBERNATE MY SESSION IN THERE
- **Wickerbottom**: I can barely sleep on a bed, nevermind the ground.

## Tips
- One could have the Siesta Lean-to prebuilt in case of emergency overheating. It may then be placed to cool down, while also giving some sanity and health. This way of using the Lean-to should only be used if one does not have an **Endothermic Fire Pit** ready, as the structure has a limited amount of uses and costs time.
- In singleplayer, a Siesta Lean-to combined with tents, can be used together to avoid seasonal bosses and even entire seasons if one has the materials and food available.

## Trivia
- A **siesta** is a short nap taken during midday in some countries with hotter climates.
- A **lean-to** is a type of shelter that consists of rafters leaning against a wall or structure forming a roof. Lean-tos are associated with camping and wilderness survival.

# Dung Beetle

## Exclusivity
- **Hamlet**

## Structure Infobox
- **Naughtiness**: 3
- **Spawn Code**: "dungbeetle"
- **Image**: Dung Beetle on Ball.png
- **Health**: 60
- **Walk Speed**: 3.5
- **Run Speed**: 6
- **Special Ability**: Rides a [Dung Ball](#).
- **Drops**: [Monster Meat](#) (100%) | [Chitin](#) (50%)
- **Spawn From**: [Dung Pile](#)

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: She's on a roll.
- **Willow**: Beat it, smelly beetle!
- **Wolfgang**: Bug runs on ball of poop.
- **Wendy**: A symbol of the ugliness of this world.
- **WX-78**: BIOLOGICAL STORAGE SYSTEM FOR ORGANIC WASTE SPHERE
- **Wickerbottom**: Scarabaeidae with her droppings.
- **Woodie**: There's a bit of a stink.
- **Maxwell**: What a filthy creature.
- **Wagstaff**: Such agility! The way he's able to navigate on that sphere of poop!
- **Wigfrid**: A mounted foe!
- **Webber**: Is that... poop?

- **Warly**: Not how I would spend my days.
- **Woodlegs**: Creature most foul.
- **Wilba**: HAS'T THE PLOPS
- **Wormwood**: You like poop too?!
- **Wheeler**: Swell. A giant bug on a giant ball of poop.
- **Choose**: Walani

The **Dung Beetle** is a passive **Mob** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It is a bug riding a **Dung Ball**. Chasing it into a **Tree**, **Boulder**, or **Structure** will cause it to fall on its back and become unable to move for a short period. Dung Beetles will go to the nearest **Dung Pile** and form a new Dung Ball if they lost their previous Dung Ball.

Dung Beetles will generally move away from the player when approached by **Day**, but will sleep on top of their Dung Balls at **Night**, making them easy to hunt at this time. Dung Beetles can also be outsped and chased down with a **Stalking Stick**. They are considered innocent creatures and killing one adds to the player's **Naughtiness**, which can cause **Krampus** to appear.

Similar to **Tumbleweed**s, the **Dung Ball** can be harvested by the player and will drop three items, the most common ones being **Manure**, **Rocks**, **Flint**.

# Instructional

There are some rules (which are more like guidelines) you should know while playing **Don't Starve**. If you are a beginner, this guide isn't based on tips, but more on what you should avoid doing in general. Remember that this is not telling you how to play, but rather they are guidelines to follow.

## 1. Don't Start a Fight you Can't Finish.
You shouldn't bite off more than you can chew. If you want to start a fight, you have to be sure you can end it. While combat is fun and all, it's more important to worry about your life. If you aren't skillful enough in taking down certain **creatures**, don't engage in fighting it.

## 2. Don't get Greedy.
If you see a bunch of loot on the ground from battles, the victors from said battle can't be far off. If you try to get in there to collect all of the loot blindly, you may find yourself low on health trying to escape. Unless you're wearing superb **armor** or it's life-threatening, don't risk your life just for shiny stuff. Keep in mind the Don't Starve world is hostile enough to not hand you everything on a platter.

## 3. Make Sure you Have a Light Source. Always.
Exploring is fun. But just in case you have to venture out from your main base of operations, you should bring spare light sources, like **torches**, **campfires** and **lanterns**. In case you get caught up in a fight you can't finish, or hungry animals are stalking you, and you can't return to your home, it'd be best to have spare light sources so **Charlie** can't attack. The night is an opportunity for many dangerous creatures, I'm sure you knew that.

## 4. If It's too Good to be True, it Probably is
Don't Starve has **set pieces** that are much like traps. Though some are helpful in any way, most set pieces are dangerous if you don't take caution. If it looks strange or out of the ordinary, take heed. Even if you come unscathed, there may still be a price to pay.

# Combat in Don't Starve: Bigger and Better Weapons Guide

Combat is one of the main features in **Don't Starve**, and often killing enemies is the way to advance progress in your world. This guide will focus on how to obtain **Bigger and Better Weapons** in the fastest and most efficient method.

## Spear
Making a **Spear** is essential in the early game, and if you're good enough, you won't be needing to craft more than one in the entire game if you manage to get enough resources for better alternatives.

### How do I get it?
You are just going to need a **Science Machine** (where in situations of exploration you can destroy just after crafting the Spear, along with a **Backpack** and other equipables). The materials needed to build a Spear are very common (`2x Twigs`, `1x Rope`, `1x Flint`), and can be crafted in emergency situations on the go, when no other option is available.

### Best situations to use it
- During the early days.
- If no other option is available.

### Advantages
- Generally, a simple **Axe** isn't enough to kill the occasional **Spider** or **Hound** threat, while the **Spear** has the advantages of being available for use early on, and having a higher damage output than common tools.
- The materials needed to build a Spear are very common, and can be crafted in emergency situations, when no other option is available.
- It can be used as a ranged weapon in **Shipwrecked** with the **Spear Gun** to deal a decent amount of damage per second, provided you're quick and swift enough to recharge it every time.
- It is a particularly versatile weapon in **Shipwrecked**, as it can be converted into a **Poison Spear** or to an **Obsidian Spear** to increase the damage output by a little bit, and gain different effects and drops from each one.

### Disadvantages
- Unfortunately, Spears don't usually deal enough damage to take care of many bosses, and you are often required to obtain better weapons, especially against tanky bosses, such as the **Dragonfly** in **Don't Starve Together** or the **Toadstool**.

## Tentacle Spike
While a Spear can be useful during the early phases of the game, after a while you are going to need an upgrade, especially by the end of **Autumn**.

### How do I get it?
Getting a **Tentacle Spike** can be really difficult to obtain, as you need to kill a **Tentacle**, which can easily lead to **death** to unexperienced players. The worst part is that the odds of getting one is one in two cases, and thus, meaning that you are going to lose precious time and health, if you get hit by the Tentacle.

### Best situations to use it
- Anytime you get one, as it's always a better alternative than tools and most starting weapons.
- Against weaker bosses.

### Advantages
- It is an incredibly strong weapon during the early game, and it can take out weaker bosses with ease.
- It is easily renewable if you happen to be more experienced.

### Disadvantages
- Not lasting so long as other weapons, it's better not to rely on this weapon alone when going to defeat tanky bosses, or when going for a long journey. Because of this, it's recommended to bring more than one, or save it as the ace in the hole for stronger foes; although this can take out precious inventory slots out of your reach.

## Morning Star
Being a particularly efficient and strong weapon in the **Caves** and in other wet environments (during **Spring**, or in **Shipwrecked** via **Seaworthy**), the **Morning Star** can prove useful also during the **night**, as it emits light.

### How do I get it?
The materials needed to get a Morning Star are moderately rare, and can be difficult to produce en masse. The fastest way to do it is to kill all **Volt Goats** (except one!) once they have reproduced, and if you're lucky, if you are going to get a bunch of **Volt Goat Horns**, although it is a very rare occurrence to get a horn from each one of them.

### Best situations to use it
- Against wet targets.
- To kill Volt Goats and get **Electric Milk**.
- During the **night** and when no other light source is available.

### Advantages
- While not the best weapon on its own, the Morning Star is best used when stroke on **wet** targets, especially against those which are perpetually (such as **Depth Worms**).

# Explore First

## Start in Fall
- Start exploring the perimeter of the map before settling.
- Wear a grass suit while exploring, especially at night.
- Avoid dangerous creatures like clockwork bishops and tentacles.
- Carry a torch and always have a spare.
- Do not carry tools; use them up and discard leftovers to save inventory space.

## Settle in a Place with Resources
- Choose a location within walking distance of essential resources like frog ponds, cave entrances, rabbits, and swamp or desert biomes.
- Avoid areas with an Igloo and Moose Goose nest.

## Get Your Base Running

### Build Essential Structures
- Build a fire pit and a science machine immediately.
- Prototype: spear, log suit, backpack, shovel, and crock pot.

### Cooking and Harvesting
- Use the campfire for cooking meats, berries, vegetables, and mushrooms.
- Catch spiders and frogs with traps.
- Hold onto monster meat to give to pigs for their help.

## Winter Is Coming

### Preparations for Winter
- Gather beard hair from black rabbits for crafting a Meat Effigy.
- Ensure an ample supply of twigs, grass, and wood.
- Build a thermal measurer and stay close to your base during extreme cold.
- Build a magic machine with rabbits for a renewable touchstone.
- Keep a thermal stone and warm clothes for exploring.

### Deerclops
- Avoid being at your base on day 30 when Deerclops appears.
- Collect drops from Deerclops but avoid getting too close.

## Get Ready For Spring

### Final Winter Tasks
- Harvest ice for summer and explore caves for light bulbs.
- Build farms and plant crops before spring arrives.
- Build a lightning rod to protect your base from lightning.
- Get an umbrella to prevent sanity drain and other problems caused by wetness.

## Summer!

### Summer Preparations
- Prototype an endothermic fire and build ice flingomatics.
- Wear a summer shirt and carry a thermal stone for emergency cooling.
- Build the magic machine, craft a chilled amulet, and carry it with you.
- Give Dragonfly 20 ash to make it hibernate.

### Exploring Caves in Summer
- Caves are cooler and safer during summer.
- Bring vegetarian food like Dragon Pies, Butterfly Muffins, or Stuffed Eggplants.

### Bunnymen
- Hire Bunnymen with carrots for help and protection.
- They drop beard hair, which is useful for crafting Meat Effigies.

### Dealing with the Fall Giant
- Give the Bearger 10 honey to make it hibernate.

## Congratulations
You have made it through a year!

The Mutated Merm is a Merm that was mutated by Wurt. Wurt with the "Lunar Mutated Merm" skill can give a Moon Shard or Infused Moon Shard to Merms that are loyal to her to transform them into Mutated Merms. These Merms deal 40 damage to enemies in an area around them when taken damage.

Wurt with "Lunar Mutated Merm" skill can use Pure Brilliance to replace 20 damage with 20 planar damage for all loyal Mutated Merms in range. This buff will last 4 minutes. All Mutated Merms with this buff will have glowing eyes.

Wurt with the Terra Mutation skill can use Brilliant Mudslinger to creates a 7x7 Mutated Marsh Turf area, and all the Merms and Merm Guards in the area that are loyal to the player will be transformed into Mutated Merms and Mutated Merm Guards. The Merms will also receive the planar damage buff for 4 minutes.

Unlike Merms and Merm Guards, the Mutated Merms and the Mutated Merm Guards will not lose their loyalty over time and will not retreat when Wurt kills a fish. They will follow their leader until she dies and then revert to their regular form. Alternatively, if Wurt wants to dismiss the Mutated Merms and the Mutated Merm Guards, the player can goes into another shard (Surface World or Caves) or leave server.

# Introduction

This guide on how to kill Dragonfly will cover a basic overview of the boss, preparation guidelines, and strategies. Dragonfly is a difficult boss in Don’t Starve Together, sporting a large health pool of 27,500. Dragonfly is equipped with an enrage mechanic that may trigger when all of her larvae have been killed. It is also important to note that Dragonfly has a higher base speed than the player, meaning that she can easily land a few hits while players are attempting to escape.

## Preparation Guidelines

For this reason, players should be appropriately equipped with higher-end battle gear. This gear includes items such as:

- Ham bats
- Dark swords
- Football helmets/battle helms
- Log suits
- Marble suits

Players should also enter battle ready with sufficient healing items such as [pierogi] or [Dragonpie|dragonpies]. The number of healing items will depend on your battle strategy, confidence in fighting, and protection. It is recommended, however, to be prepared with at least 800 health worth of food (the equivalent of 20 pierogis). Gear will also depend on your confidence and strategy.

The **Cat Cap** is a [[Category:Hats|Hat]] [[Item]] found in the [[Clothing Filter]] and [[Winter Items Filter]]. It requires 1 [[Cat Tail]]s and 4 [[Silk]] to craft and an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype. The [[Sewing Kit]] repairs 50% of its durability.

Cat Caps restore 3.3 [[Sanity]]/min while worn and are ''tier 1'' warm clothing items, increasing the time a character can be without a fire during the [[Winter]] before [[Freezing]]. They have an [[Freezing#Game Mechanics|insulation factor]] of 60.

Since [[Catcoons]] can easily go extinct on a map, and only drop their Cat Tails by chance, it is best to keep this Hat maintained with a Sewing Kit.

## Skins
{{Main|Belongings#Cat_Cap-1|Belongings}}
- **Woven - Distinguished Puppy Cap** skin was introduced during the official [[Year of the Varg]] event in 2018.
- **Distinguished Tied Trapper Hat** and **Trapper Hat** skins are only obtainable during the official [[Year of the Gobbler]] event.

## Trivia
- Since Catcoon is a portmanteau of "cat " and "raccoon", this item is most likely based on the real life [[Wikipedia:Coonskin_cap|Coonskin Cap]], made most famous by the frontiersman [[Wikipedia:Davy_CrocketT|Davy Crockett]]. Wickerbottom's quote references this by saying "Not quite like Crockett's, but it'll do."
- Visually, the Cat Cap also resembles an [[Wikipedia:Ushanka|Ushanka Cap]].
- In older versions of ''Reign of Giants'', the Cat Cap had resistance to wetness and was dropped outright by killing Catcoons.

# Crystal Deerclops

The Crystal Deerclops is a **boss monster** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the "From Beyond" update. It is the reanimated corpse of a regular Deerclops, possessed by a Brightshade Gestalt if a Lunar Rift is active in the world.

## Behavior

### General
- **Health:** 6000
- **Damage:** 75 (players) / 150 (mobs)
- **Planar Damage:** 30
- **Attack Range:** 5 (melee) / 6-14 (ranged crystal)

## Attack Pattern

When Crystal Deerclops is in combat, it cools the space around itself, creating an ice aura that slows players and lowers their temperature, causing Freezing damage. It also has a ranged attack, throwing ice crystals at the player, which can be dodged.

## Hunting Strategy

- **Fire:** Bait the ranged attack twice, then light the Crystal Deerclops on fire to stun it. Use weapons like the Fire Staff, Fire Dart, or Fiery Pen.
- **Planar Entity Protection:** Planar weapons like Brightshade Sword and/or Shadow Reaper are recommended over Dark Sword, Ham Bat, or Gunpowder.
- **Armor:** Use Armor with Planar Defense to mitigate Planar Damage.

## Trivia

- The Crystal Deerclops was introduced in the "Host of Horrors" update.
- The Winter's Feast Deerclops can also transform into Crystal Deerclops after its death.
