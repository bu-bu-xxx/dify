## Behavior

Guardian Pigs are aggressive Pigs that spawn from Pig Torches. They have higher Health than regular Pigs but drop the same resources. They cannot be bribed with Meat or attracted by a One-man Band, making them appear to be very loyal to their Pig King.

If a Guardian Pig is dead, it will respawn at its Pig Torch after 4 days. In Sandbox Mode, they may be located seemingly in the middle of nowhere, usually guarding small patches of Grass and Berry Bushes. While in Adventure Mode, they stay in the Pig Fortress, which is surrounded by Wood Walls. In world 4 of Adventure Mode, you can find 4 Pig Torches surrounding the Pig King instead of Obelisks. Sometimes, the Guardian pigs will be protecting a Maxwell Statue instead.

## Damage Taken by Weapon

| Weapon | No. of hits for Guardian Pig |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Fishing Rod, Bug Net | 71 |
| Lucy the Axe | 23 |
| Shovel, Pitchfork | 18 |
| Hammer, Torch, Umbrella | 12 |
| Walking Cane, Willow's Lighter | 10 |
| Axe, Pickaxe | 9 |
| Luxury Axe, Opulent Pickaxe | 8 |

| Slurtle Slime, Tentacle Spike | 5 |
| Battle Spear, Fire Dart | 5 |
| Fire Staff | 3 |
| Thulecite Club | 2 |
| Tooth Trap | 1 |

Guardian Pigs take 2 blasts from the Ice Staff to be frozen and 3 Sleep Darts to be put to sleep.

## Apparel

Pigs can wear headgear items. Clicking on a Pig with a headgear item selected will equip it on the Pig. If a Pig receives a head item, it will be able to receive its Protection, Planar Defense, and other effects. The durability will still be drained same as the Player. Usually, the only way to get hats back from Pigs without killing them is to replace it with another hat, as fighting the Pig will break it before the Pig dies. Frogs can also make them drop a given hat too. The Pigs can also wear the Miner Hat; while wearing it, they will provide light and not panic during dusk or in a Cave, while also preventing nearby Pigs from panicking.

The **Shamlet Mask** is a **Hat** Item exclusive to **Webber** in the **Hamlet** DLC. When playing a **Hamlet** world or **Hamlet**-compatible world, Webber will start out with a Shamlet Mask in his **Inventory** at the start. Additional masks can be crafted in the **Dress Tab**, using two **Twigs**, a **Pig Skin**, and **Beard Hair**.

Wearing the Shamlet Mask allows Webber to travel safely through the **Pig City**, without causing panic for the civilians and being attacked by the **Royal Guards**. Other neutral **Mobs** (such as **Pogs**, **Bunnymen**, **Catcoons**, etc.) will no longer attack him as well. However, the disguise also fools **Spiders** which will be aggressive towards Webber.

The Shamlet Mask doesn't have a limited durability or any other additional effects.

## Trivia

* The name of the item is a play on the words 'sham' and 'Hamlet'.
* It may be based on [Groucho glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_glasses).
* The Shamlet Mask is only available when the player owns both **Reign of Giants** and **Hamlet** DLC, since the character Webber can only be unlocked via **Webber's Skull**, which can only be obtained when owning **Reign of Giants** DLC.
* A similar item, the **Clever Disguise**, was added to **Don't Starve Together** as a character-specific item for the DLC character **Wurt**. It disguises other players as Merms.

# Garland

## Description
The **Garland** is a wearable **Dress** item for the head slot. It requires 12 **Petals** to craft. It is easy to make and can help maintain **Sanity** early on, as it is available to craft from the beginning of the game. It restores 1.33 **Sanity**/min while worn, but in **Don't Starve Together**, **Wurt** loses 1.33 **Sanity**/min instead. The Garland spoils over time, like **Food**, spoiling 25% slower in **Winter**. When it is completely spoiled, it disappears without leaving any **Rot**. Its **Sanity** restoration stays constant over time despite the spoilage level of the Garland, meaning it does not need to be replaced until completely worn out.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: It smells like prettiness.
- **Willow**: A halo of flowers. Too bad it's not a burning halo of flowers.
- **Wolfgang**: Is so pretty!
- **Wendy**: But I am in mourning...
- **WX-78**: AT LEAST THEY ARE DEAD
- **Wickerbottom**: How celebratory.
- **Woodie**: I think wildflowers look nice with my red hair.
- **Maxwell**: Definitely not my style.
- **Wagstaff**: It counteracts the effects of psychic attack! Fascinating!
- **Wigfrid**: Flimsy för the fight, lövely för my head.
- **Webber**: Colorful crown.
- **Walani**: That's a happy looking headpiece!
- **Warly**: Who doesn't look good in this?!
- **Woodlegs**: 'Tis a pretty flower 'at.
- **Wilba**: 'TIS A PRETTY HAT
- **Wormwood**: Friends for head
- **Wheeler**: A proper hat for adventuring in peaceful meadows.
- **Winona**: For getting dolled up.
- **Wortox**: I'll place a crown upon my head to ward away the growing dread.
- **Wurt**: Hat ugly, but killing flowers fun!
- **Walter**: Hey, that looks swell!

## Skins
In **Don't Starve Together**, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the **Belongings** page.

- The **Spiffy Holly Wreath** and **Ribbon Wreath** skins are only obtainable during the official **Winter's Feast** event.
- The **Woven - Elegant Feathered Wreath** and **Life Blossom Garland** skins were introduced during the official **The Forge** event in 2017.

## Tips
- Wearing a **wet** Garland is actually more damaging to **Sanity** than it is helpful.
- Too many players making Garland can be disruptive to hives making honey, obtaining **Butterflies** for more flowers or **Butterfly Wings** for **Butter Muffins**. Using a Garland for as much as is needed and then sharing it is a more effective strategy until silk is able to be obtained regularly.

## Trivia
- The Garland was added in the **Insanity!** update.
- The Garland was a fan suggestion.
- Garlands used to be edible in the older versions of **Don't Starve**.

### Cozy Bunnymen Information
Cozy Bunnymen are creatures that appear from the ground as soon as carrots are placed on the Bunnyman Shrine. There are 9 of them in total and unlike regular Bunnymen they do not attack or run away from characters considered "monsters", but burrow back into the ground when any hostile creature is nearby or a player has attacked a Cozy Bunnyman. They can be asked to fight in the Pillow Fight Pit in the evening or at night with a Glove of Challenge. They also sometimes play Spin the Carrot, in which one of the rabbits spins the carrots, and the Bunnyman who was picked by the carrot will have to eat the Hare Ball, which will be spit out by the Bunnyman spinning the carrot. If a player was selected by the carrot and they picked up the Hare Ball they will be given Red Pouches. In the evening and at night they fight with pillows, and during the day they sleep. During the day, you can wake them up by hitting them with a pillow. Cozy Bunnymen also ignore 99% damage. During a Full Moon

# Worm Hole

A **Worm Hole** is a living tunnel that warps the player to a different area of the map. Worm Holes appear as a mouth in the ground and will open when approached by the player. When the option ‘Jump’ is selected, the character will leap inside to be spit out the other end after a brief delay. There are multiple Worm Holes in most worlds and they always connect the same two places on the map. Often they will end in two completely different areas with different resources, such as a [Forest] with lots of [Trees] and a [Savanna] with lots of [Grass].

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: Science compels me to jump in.
- **Willow**: I wonder if he likes spicy food?
- **Wolfgang**: It can not harm this man!
- **Wendy**: No matter what it consumes, it is never satisfied.
- **WX-78**: THIS MEAT TUBE WILL SERVE MY PURPOSES
- **Wickerbottom**: Concentric rings of teeth for rapid ingestion
- **Woodie**: I'm not sure I want to look at that, eh?
- **Maxwell**: I can assure you that it smells worse than it looks.
- **Wagstaff**: I'm immensely curious to discover what would happen if I jumped inside.
- **Wigfrid**: Its maw welcomes me.
- **Webber**: I've been in worse.
- **Walani**: Well, I see no reason not to jump in.
- **Warly**: That is no ordinary tooth-lined hole in the ground!
- **Woodlegs**: Whar'n Hades do thet lead?
- **Wilba**: WHEREFORE YON IT GO'ETH?

- **Wheeler**: Here goes nothing.
- **Winona**: Here we go!
- **Wortox**: Watch my impression of mortal food.
- **Wurt**: Ha ha! It just toothy tunnel, florp.
- **Walter**: It IS a mouth!! Come on, Woby. Let's get a closer look.
- **Wanda**: Not my preferred way to get around, but it'll do in a pinch.

## Sick Worm Hole

A **Sick Worm Hole** is a dying Worm Hole found in the "Two Worlds" chapter of Adventure Mode. Sick Worm Holes can only be used for one-way travel, after which their "exit" shrivels up and dies. They look similar to their healthy counterparts, but their "skin" and mouth have a yellowish/greenish tint, instead of being brown; the color of a normal Worm Hole.

## Downloadable Content

- In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, Worm Holes do not exist. However, the **Electric Isosceles** acts in a similar manner.
- In the **Hamlet** DLC, Worm Holes are used to connect unreachable islands.

## Tips

- Worm Holes can be used to escape dangerous enemies, such as Deerclops, Hounds, or MacTusk, but they will be waiting at the Worm Hole when it is used to return. This can be a good way to temporarily escape tough mobs when unprepared to deal with them at the moment.
- Worm Hole camps can be built, in order to have a backup base, with Fire Pits, Science Machines, and other structures on both sides, in case tough enemies show up.
- The player should check both entrances before seasons such as Winter in case stationary monsters show up, such as MacTusk or Tallbirds, and prepare to battle them as soon the player emerges from the Worm Hole.
- Building a settlement near one or multiple Worm Holes offers quick travel to another biome/area.
- It's a good idea to note the positions and links between Worm Holes, to avoid confusion/wasted time. A good way to do this is by building Structures, dropping items or planting Plants of the same type and have Map icons close to two linked Wormholes. In DST, skins can be used to differentiate between wormholes as these are visible from the map.
- A Worm Hole can be used as a way to move items without worrying about inventory slots and Sanity loss.
- Jumping through a pair of wormholes can allow a player to quickly become Insane.

## Trivia

- The Sick Worm Hole was added in the **Don't Starve/Version History#Doorway to Adventure|Doorway To Adventure** update.
- **Wickerbottom** refers to the Worm Hole as "*Megadrilacea oraduos*". Megadrilacea is an order of earthworms, and oraduos means two mouths or openings.
- A Worm Hole spawned via DebugSpawn will only open its

## Skins

In [Don't Starve Together], Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the [Belongings] page.

- The **Loyal** **"Will You Bee Mine?"** skin was awarded for playing **Don't Starve Together** around Valentine's Day 2022.

## Trivia

- The Bee Mine was added in the **The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You** update.
- In the **old research system**, its research cost was 100.
- Sometimes two Bee Mines will spawn next to a **Skeleton** as a **Set Piece**. These can be safely picked up.
- Placed Bee Mines have the option to be smashed with **Hammer**, with predictable results.

## Bugs

- Multiple Bee Mines can cause render lag as they are constantly pulsating.
- Sometimes, the mine can trigger while in a **Chest**, a **Backpack**, or even the inventory without being placed.

# Rain Coat

- **Image**: ![Rain Coat](Rain_Coat_Dropped.png) ![Icon](Rain_Coat.png)
- **Ingredients**:
  - **Tentacle Spots**: 2
  - **Rope**: 2
  - **Bone Shards**: 2
- **Tab**: Dress
- **Tier**: 1
- **Repaired by Sewing**: Yes
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "raincoat"
- **Water Resistance**: 100% resistance
- **Freezing Resistance**: 60
- **Wears Out**: 10 days
- **Perk**: Protects from rain and lightning. Delays freezing during [Winter].

The **Rain Coat** is a craftable [Dress] [Item] from the [Reign of Giants] DLC. It requires 2 [Tentacle Spots], 2 [Rope], and 2 [Bone Shards] to craft and a [Science Machine] to prototype.

When worn during [Rain], the player's [Wetness] will not increase at all. Additionally, it insulates the player against [Lightning] strikes and the electric shocks of a charged [Volt Goat]. Rain Coats are tier 1 warm clothing, providing 60 insulation from [Freezing].

Rain Coats last for 10 days and a [Sewing Kit] will repair 50% of its durability.

## Tips
- The Rain Coat is a viable item to wear helmets such as [Miner Hat] while equipping tools or [weapons] without getting wet.
- When fighting [Mosling]s, the Rain Coat can be handy to protect against the frequent lightning strikes that will occur, while still allowing armor to be equipped in the head slot.
- One might not benefit from the Rain Coat fully, as it's usually more efficient to wear other wetness-resistant equipment, such as an [Eyebrella]; and wear a [Backpack] or an [Armor] piece instead.

# Spiky Bush

![Idle](Spiky Bush.png) ![Picked](Spiky Bush Picked.png) ![Dead](Spiky Bush Dead.png)

## Overview

The **Spiky Bush** is an in-game flora commonly found in **Marsh** and **Desert** biomes. It acts as a source of **Twigs**, similar to **Saplings**. Spiky Bushes are not affected by **Winter** cold and will regrow after 4 game days during both **Summer** and in Winter. Harvesting Twigs from a spiky bush damages health by 3 points.

## Attributes

- **Biome**: Marsh
- **Spawn Code**: marsh_bush
- **Renew**: Yes
- **Tool**: Can be Dug with a Shovel
- **Picked**: Can be picked (Twigs)
- **CanBeBurned**: Yes

## Details

Spiky Bushes can be dug up with a Shovel and replanted in a new location. This gives a Twig and an equivalent Sapling and is the safer way of getting Twigs, as digging and picking up a Spiky Bush does not damage the player. The bushes themselves can also be used as an effective fuel for Campfires, though they are not renewable. In this regard, they are similar to Saplings and Grass Tufts.

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: It looks thorny.
- **Willow**: It looks sharp.
- **Wolfgang**: Is thorny.
- **Wendy**: A bush that always hurts.

## Downloadable Content

In **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC, Spiky Bushes can also be found in the **Desert** biome.

In **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, Prime Apes that have been befriended by the player may also harvest Spiky Bushes, if they are brought over to a Shipwrecked world. This will cause them to take slight damage.

## Tips

Spiky Bushes can be safely harvested with a Bramble Husk equipped, without losing health. The Bramble Husk also won't lose durability.

With the **Don't Starve Mega Update** new mechanic changes, players can now collect, pick up items, craft and load weapons while mounted on beefalos. This makes harvesting twigs from spiky bushes have no player health penalty at all, while the thorns damage goes to the beefalo, increasing its ornery tendency points.

## Trivia

There are two texture sets in the game, one in darker gray the other in very light, ashen gray. This is merely a cosmetic, visual difference and has no impact on the game.

## Scrapbook Info
Wearing the One-Man Band is a sanity-lowering experience, but converts nearby pigmen and bunnymen to followers.

## Description
The **One-Man Band** is a **Magic** **Item** that can be used to temporarily befriend up to 9 **Pigs** or **Bunnymen** in close vicinity, something that otherwise can only be done by feeding them. It requires 2 **Gold Nuggets**, 4 **Nightmare Fuel**, and 2 **Pig Skins** to craft and a **Prestihatitator** to prototype.

The One-Man Band is worn on the body and will drain the character's **Sanity** at a rate of 2 points per minute. Each Pig or Bunnyman befriended with the One-Man Band will drain additional 25 Sanity points per minute. With the max of 9 followers, this means losing Sanity at 227 points per minute.

The device lasts for 3 minutes (4.5 game hours), degrading when equipped. Once a character stops playing the band, the followers will only stay loyal for a few seconds. Pigs and Bunnymen don't immediately stop following and doing the player's bidding, which means that the player should use it at short bursts instead of keeping it equipped constantly, to avoid big sanity drops.

The One-Man Band does not draw Pigs out of their **Pig Houses** or Bunnymen out of their **Rabbit Hutches**.

One-Man Band can be used to spawn **Music Box Hutch**, by placing it inside Hutch together with a **Glow Berry** or a **Light Bulb**.

It can also be used to tend multiple **Farm Plants

# Books in Don't Starve

Books are items craftable by **Wickerbottom**. They can be read several times at the cost of **Sanity** to trigger various types of events. The durability can be regenerated by storing the books in **Bookcases**. Only Wickerbottom and **Maxwell** can use the books, although Maxwell has to pay a higher sanity penalty. **Wurt** can read the books to either gain or lose sanity but won't trigger their effects.

**Description**

Waffles is a Food item cooked in the Crock Pot by combining 1 Butter, 1 Egg, and 1 Berry. It is the second best Health restoring food and provides 60 HP, 37.5 Hunger, and 5 Sanity (the first being Mandrake Soup, restoring 100 HP). It takes 10 seconds to cook. Waffles are a difficult food to obtain due to needing butter, which has a 2% chance of dropping from Butterflies. Eggs are also another factor which limits you from getting waffles early-game.

Adding a Mandrake may result in Mandrake Soup. In the Shipwrecked DLC, adding Wobster or Shark Fin will instead result in Wobster Dinner and Shark Fin Soup respectively.

**Prerequisites**

- Requires: Butter
- Requires: Berries, Juicy Berries
- Requires: Eggs

**Recipe**

| Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Result | Tool |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Butter | All Eggs | Berry | Filler | Waffles | Crock Pot |

**Examples**

| Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Note |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Butter | Egg | Berries | Twigs | A recipe for Waffles that preserves as much hunger value as possible. |

**Usage**

| Item | Tool | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| Waffles | Pig Icon | Manure |

**Tips**

- Waffles serve as a good alternative for Warly to make use of butter in the absence of honey and sufficient fruit for Fresh Fruit Crepes. In both Shipwrecked and Hamlet, certain trees will drop eggs, though in Shipwrecked Jungle Trees will also drop banana that can satisfy the fruit requirement for Crepes.

**Trivia**

- During the Pig Fiesta event in the Hamlet DLC, Waffles takes on a more festive appearance.
- Wurt can eat this, even though it requires Eggs as an ingredient.

# Durian
A **Durian** is a rare **fruit** and **food** item. It can be **cooked** on a **fire** into an **Extra Smelly Durian**, and also used as an ingredient in **Crock Pot** recipes. Durians can be **farmed** from **Farm Plots**. Regular **Seeds** have a 5% chance of growing Durians. **Durian Seeds** can be gained by feeding a Durian to **Birds** in a **Birdcage**, which can produce 1–2 **Durian Seeds** as well as a 50% chance to get normal Seeds.

Like **Monster Meat**, raw Durian damages **health** and **sanity**, and also affects Crock Pot recipes. It can be used as a fruit/any filler in Crock Pot recipe with no toxic effects, but using more than 1 Durian in a Crock Pot recipe could result in **Monster Lasagna** unless the recipe contains **Twigs** or has higher priority.

**Webber** will still take the health and sanity penalties from eating Durians.

## Extra Smelly Durian
**Extra Smelly Durian** is made by **cooking** a Durian. This cooked version does not damage **health** but one will still lose **Sanity**. It can be used as an ingredient in several **Crock Pot** recipes.

It will still produce **Monster Lasagna** if more than one is included in the **Crock Pot**.

### Usage
- **Durian** can be turned into **Durian Seeds** by feeding them to a bird, then eaten for more hunger.
- **Wurt** can eat Durians without the Sanity penalty and gain extra hunger from them.
- **Wurt** benefits slightly more from **Pumpkin**s despite the extra benefit from Durians.

### Tips
- Turning Durian Fruit into seeds by feeding them to a bird then eating the seeds will provide more hunger than using 3-4 durian fruit in a crockpot recipe, at 9.375 hunger per seed when raw. On top of that, there is a chance of getting 2 seeds per fruit and an extra regular seed on top of that. While the crockpot recipes provide more health and sanity, this method is best for pure hunger and crop seeds have a rot timer of 40 days, which ties with regular Seeds and Honey for the longest time to rot for a foodstuff besides Powdercakes.

### Trivia
- The sanity loss, character quotes, and the name "Extra Smelly" refer to the foul odor that the real-life fruit can emit. Not all varieties of Durian have a foul odor, but it can be so pungent and linger for so long that Durians have been banned in some establishments and public transport. Known colloquially as the "King of Fruits", Durian is a creamy soft fruit.
- Durian is a popular fruit in Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines.
- Using Durian to produce Monster Lasagna makes it theoretically possible to feed **Wigfrid** without meat.
- Durians can theoretically be used for almost everything that Monster Meat is used for, besides some crockpot dishes and crafting, by cooking it into Monster Lasagna.

## Scrapbook Info
When thrown, creates a cloud that will put creatures to sleep.

The **Napsack** is a **Weapons Filter Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. To prototype it, players need its **Rare Blueprint**, which is dropped by the **Misery Toadstool**. Four Napsacks can be crafted using a **Shroom Skin** and a Poisoned **Canary**.

Napsacks can be thrown, similar to **Water Balloons**, to create a sleep cloud, causing all nearby **Mobs** to go to sleep for a maximum of 20 seconds.

## Prototype Tips
- Napsacks can be used to duplicate Shroom Skin by using a **Deconstruction Staff**, since four Napsacks are made each batch. Since **Green Gems** are renewable through **Tumbleweeds**, **Dragonfly** and **Ruins regeneration**, this can be used to mass-produce Shroom Skins from at least one skin.
- When deconstructing Napsacks, the player can equip **The Lazy Forager** to pick up Poisoned **Canary** immediately.

## Trivia
- "Napsack" is a portmanteau of the words "nap" and "knapsack".
- The Napsack was added in an unnamed **Don't Starve Together/Version History#May 18, 2017 - Bonus Update** after the completion of **A New Reign**.
- A "Knapsack" (or "Napsack") is a sack-like strapped carry-on, similar to a backpack.

## Scrapbook Info
A record of all the foods cooked and/or eaten, as well as the ingredients used to cook them.

- For complete list of Crock Pot recipes: [Dishes](Dishes)
- For complete list of Portable Crock Pot recipes: [Portable Crock Pot](Portable Crock Pot)

## Description
The Cookbook is a Cooking Filter item exclusive to Don't Starve Together. It requires 1 Papyrus and 1 Carrot to craft and a Science Machine to prototype. If the player is the one who cooked it, the player learns a recipe after picking the food item from either the Crock Pot or the Portable Crock Pot. Learned recipes are stored in the player's online profile and are conserved between all servers. They can be viewed in the Compendium. The Cookbook is not needed to learn recipes, but it is needed to display the acquired knowledge. 

Once the food is eaten, it shows the Health, Sanity, and Hunger the recipe heals, as well as bonus effects, such as Jellybeans' regeneration effect, or Spicy Chili's temperature increase.

## Categories and Sorting
The Cookbook recipes can be sorted in 5 categories: Alphabetic, Health, Sanity, Hunger, and Side Effects. "Alphabetic" will show the recipes in alphabetic order. Choosing any stat will show the recipes you know that heal the most of the selected one first. Choosing "Side Effect" will show recipes with bonus effects first. You may also filter the recipes as: Meat, Veggie, Others, and Side Effect. Choosing any of the options will show only recipes with the criteria.

## Correspondence Between Cookbook and Actual Values

## Trivia
- The Cookbook was introduced in the August QOL Update.
- Modded foods are saved locally. They are not saved to player's online profile, but they do appear in their own tab within the cookbook screen.
- The Cookbook layout is very similar to the one in The Gorge event.
- Before the Reap What You Sow update, a cookbook's cost was 1 papyrus, 1 feather pencil, and 2 silk.

## Dragonfly Behavior

Dragonfly is one of the four Giants in the Reign of Giants DLC, representing the season of Summer. She is a large monster with both reptilian and insectoid traits. When killed, Dragonfly will drop Scales and 8 Meat.

In Reign of Giants, Dragonfly will spawn in Summer and remain neutral for as long as she is not attacked or approached. Her default flight speed is faster than a player's default speed without modifiers. While neutral, she will spit lava on various objects, turning them to Ashes which she will then eat. After Dragonfly has consumed 20 or more Ashes, she will fall asleep unless the player is nearby.

When attacked or when the player gets too close, Dragonfly will enter her "enraged mode" and follow the player while lighting everything in her path on fire. She will follow the player through wormholes. This mode lasts for a while until Dragonfly either loses interest or her attacker is dead. During rain, this mode has a shorter duration. If frozen, Dragonfly will immediately return to her calm state once she thaws (barring player proximity). When frozen, she will thaw very quickly.

When Dragonfly gets in range of her target, she will use a swipe attack while moving forward. When contact has been made, she will slam the ground three times, creating a ring of fire with each impact. This attack will set objects on fire, causing massive AoE damage.

When hit, Dragonfly will enrage and perform a large "ring of fire" AOE attack after squeaking. Any Campfires or Endothermic Fires caught in the attack will be fueled up and Mobs will be set on fire. When enraged, she will engulf herself in flames and deal constant fire damage to anything nearby while also setting flammable objects on fire.

## Strategy

### General Tips

- When fighting Dragonfly using melee weapons, a Tentacle Spike or better is recommended as well as two Football Helmets and two Log Suits, as her AoE ground slam can deal enough damage to instantly kill certain characters without armor.
- A very cold Thermal Stone will likely be needed to avoid Overheating. An Endothermic Fire or Ice Box nearby is also recommended.
- Dragonfly takes 4 Sleep Darts to be put to sleep. Notably, although it does no damage, Dragonfly can be stunned when hit by the Fire Staff.
- When frozen, Dragonfly will thaw very quickly, making it ineffective to rely on freezing for the sake of immobilization. However, freezing still can be used to calm her down.
- Dragonfly is able to be "barricaded" behind two structures and fought relatively safely. The gap must be large enough for the player to walk through but small enough that a Koalefant can't. This will allow the player to strike her while still avoiding all of her attacks

- Choose: Woodlegs

The **Yaarctopus** resides in one of the **Coral Reefs** that generally spawn in the **Shallow Ocean** **Biome**. He is found lying on a Coral Rock wearing an eyepatch, a small pirate hat, an earring on the side of his head, and a wooden pegleg on one of his tentacles. He is immune to any damage and cannot be attacked. He is the **Shipwrecked** equivalent to the **Pig King**.

The player may trade any **Fishes**, **Trinkets**, and certain Fish **Crock Pot** recipes with the Yaarctopus in exchange for an **Octopus Chest** anytime except when he sleeps (which happens in night or after giving an item). Attempting to give any other item than the aforementioned ones, to a woken up Yaarctopus will result in them shaking its head. After handing in one viable Item, the Yaarctopus will fall asleep for the rest of the remaining day and cannot again be traded with until he wakes up.

- Wurt: Blegh, this where baby Spiderfolk come from?
- Walter: Aww, it's full of baby spiders!
- Wanda: I should squish them now, it'll save me the hassle later on...

## Description
Spider Eggs are acquired by destroying a Tier 3 Spider Den or killing a Spider Queen. They can be planted on the ground by picking them up from the inventory and clicking the ground with the right mouse button. This will create a tier 1 Spider Den, which then grows normally.

Spider Eggs can be used to create Spider Dens at any specific place, often an area where one can safely contain the Spiders for Silk farming. Spider Eggs are also a great fuel for Campfires, adding a lot of burn time.

Webber begins the game with Spider Eggs, and he can craft more in his Survivor Items Filter, using 12 Silk, 4 Spider Glands, and 3 Papyrus.

## Trivia
- When removing/inserting Spider Eggs from/into one's inventory, the item makes a squelching noise. In addition, when selected from the inventory, the eggs will make a "Babum" sound.
- Despite what Wilson says after inspecting Spider Eggs, they will never hatch unless the player manually plants them.
- The description for this recipe may be a reference to the Beatles' song "With a Little Help from My Friends".
- Wx-78's quote "SPIDER POTENTIAL = 6" is the number of spiders that can live in a tier 2 den and the number of legs all spiders have in-game.
- If paired with a few Rabbit Hutches, Spider Eggs can be turned into a reliable spider farm.

### Description
Werepigs are hostile mobs that Pigs and Guardian Pigs can transform into during a Full Moon or after a Pig eats 4 pieces of meat-based Monster Foods. Pig Traders and Royal Guards will not become Werepigs if these conditions are met. A typical Werepig will transform back into a normal Pig after 4 game hours (shorter for Guardian Pigs) of being a Werepig or at the start of the next day, whichever comes first. Like most monsters, they are hostile and will attack anything nearby (including other Pigs). Werepigs will stop to eat any Food on the ground and will produce Manure if they eat Fruits or Vegetables. Unlike normal Pigs, they will also eat raw Mandrakes. When killed, they drop 2 pieces of Meat and 1 Pig Skin.

### Tips

- If the player has enough Monster Foods, more resources can be gained by killing Werepigs instead of normal Pigs. Give it four Monster Meats to make it turn. Naughtiness will not be gained for killing Werepigs, nor will Pigs attack you for attacking the Werepig.
- A Werepig can be used to convert stacks of Petals or other unwanted Vegetables to Manure as it will eat through a whole stack in one sitting without chasing anything.
- A Werepig pack is dangerous. It is advised that one stays away from Pig Villages during the night of the full moon (even if it means leaving the player's base). If one wants to kill a Werepig (or to simply see one), it is best to use the alternative method by feeding a normal Pig Monster Meats during the day.
- A Werepig will run against walls without destroying them if there's food across from the walls. Putting a non-spoiling edible item like Rot out of their reach lets one build walls around Pigs without having to worry about their full moon rampages.
- Feeding a Werepig with 18 raw Red Caps will kill the werepig.
- During the Werepig howling animation, it is completely vulnerable to being hit without retaliation so the player can place in a few hits during its transformation for free damage.
- As Pig Skins are a guaranteed as a drop from Werepigs, farming them provides easy

## Trivia

  - Wendy: "Death surrounds me. Well, my torso anyhow."
  - WX-78: "EXTREMELY LUSH VEST"
  - Wickerbottom: "Whatever it was, its pelt makes for a fine garment."
  - Woodie: "Now this is some proper winter gear."

  - Wurt: "Feel warm and fuzzy..."
  - Walter: "Hey Woby, we match!"
  - Wanda: "It reminds me of that time I was almost eaten by a bearger, but it's cozy."

## Skins
- **Loyal Winter Hibearnation Vest**: Awarded for playing Don't Starve Together during the official Winter's Feast events in 2022.
- **Loyal Rosebloom Bearger Vest**: Awarded for watching 3 hours of Don't Starve Together on Twitch from September 12, 2024 to October 10, 2024.

## Tips
- The Hibearnation Vest is the second best Sanity restoring item in the game, the best one being the Tam o' Shanter and, in the Shipwrecked DLC, the Shark Tooth Crown. It's also the best sanity restoring item for the chest slot.
- Wearing the Hibearnation Vest will mostly negate the Sanity loss during Dusk or Night, and while in the Caves or Ruins. While equipped the sanity loss from darkness is -0.6/min, a value the game considers too small to show a sanity loss indicator. This, combined with the delay of hunger loss and insulation factor, makes the vest highly useful when exploring the Caves and Ruins in Autumn or Winter.

## Trivia
- "Hibearnation" is a play on the words "Hibernation" and "Bear".
- Maxwell's and Walani's examination quote references a Simpsons episode where Mr. Burns shows off his collection of clothes made from rare animals.
- The Hibearnation Vest used to be dropped by Bearger directly, without needing to be crafted.

## Description

The **Bull Kelp Stalk** is obtained by picking a beached Bull Kelp plant. It can both be planted in the Ocean to create a new Bull Kelp plant and be deployed as a **Weapon**. It is used as a whip and has the same damage value and extended melee range as the **Tail o' Three Cats**.

As the Bull Kelp Stalk not only has a limited durability, but also perishes slowly over time and can be stacked in the **Inventory**. Bull Kelp Stalks can also be used as a mediocre **Fuel** material for **Fire**.

Each attack reduces the freshness by a random amount between 2 to 4%. When Bull Kelp Stalk freshness is below 50%, each attack has a 10% chance to destroy the Bull Kelp Stalk.

New Bull Kelp Stalk has a rare chance to be found in **Ocean Debris**.

## Trivia

- When the Bull Kelp Stalk was implemented, it initially used an inventory icon that was a recolored version of the Tail o' Three Cats'.

Funcaps can be given to pigs or bunnymen, resulting in them wearing the caps and thus spawning spores. This can give enough spores to have multiple glowcaps lit up and you can just use your everyday pig farm to generate the spores.

## Trivia

- Funcaps were added in the Warts and All update.
- An icon for an unimplemented green Mushroom Hat could be found in the game files, before Funcaps were added to the game.

The Trusty Slingshot is used to shoot Slingshot Ammo with various damages and effects. An inventory slot opens to place Slingshot Ammo when the Trusty Slingshot is equipped.

Its attack speed is 0.9 second / hit, excluding extra time of pre-cast swing. Compared to melee weapons' 0.45 second / hit, its attack speed is half of melee weapons' attack speed.

Attacks from the Trusty Slingshot will not draw aggro if the target is fighting something else.

## Description

Electric Milk is a Dairy Food item from the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC. It is dropped by killing a Volt Goat that has been charged, i.e., struck by Lightning, or attacked with a Morning Star or an Electric Dart. Electric Milk can be consumed as it is, or used as an ingredient for recipes in the Crock Pot, such as Ice Cream.

When consumed, it restores 10 sanity, making it a mediocre Sanity-restoring item; this is far lower than the Sanity restored from Ice Cream, a food that requires a dairy item such as Electric Milk to create.

## Recipe

### Ice Cream

- **Item 1**: Dairy product
- **Item 2**: Ice
- **Item 3**: Sweetener
- **Item 4**: Filler
- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Ice Cream

# Dapper Vest

## Description
The **Dapper Vest** is a **Dress** item in the game. It is rugged, yet stylish and provides several benefits to the player.

## Crafting
- Requires 8 **Hound's Tooth** and 6 **Silk** to craft.
- Requires an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.
- Can be repaired with a **Sewing Kit** which repairs 50% of its durability.

## Attributes
- Tier: 2
- Does not stack.
- Wears out in 10 days.
- Restores sanity over time and delays freezing during Winter.
- Sanity drain: +3.33/min
- Freezing resistance: 60
- Spawn code: "sweatervest"

## Benefits
- Restores 3.3 **Sanity** per minute while worn.
- Tier 1 warm clothing, increasing the time a character can be without a fire during Winter before Freezing.
- Insulation factor of 60, same as **Rabbit Earmuffs** and **Breezy Vest**, but provides sanity restoration unlike either item.

## Crafting the Hibearnation Vest
The Dapper Vest can be used to craft the **Hibearnation Vest** using the following recipe:
- 1 Dapper Vest
- 1 Thick Fur
- 2 Rope
- Result: Hibearnation Vest
- Tool: Alchemy Engine

## Trivia
- The Dapper Vest was added in the "[The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You](Don't Starve/Version History)" update.
- Requires Hound's Teeth to make because its pattern is called **houndstooth**. This is a pun by the developers.
- Because the Dapper Vest restores 3.3 Sanity/min and Rain drains a maximum of 3.3 Sanity/min, the Dapper Vest can be used to negate or reverse the Sanity drain of Rain.
- The Dapper Vest is one out of the two best Sanity restoring body items in the game, excluding the "RoG" exclusive **Hibearnation Vest**.
- Along with several other clothing items, the Dapper Vest used to not have any durability.

### Description
Merms are semi-aggressive [[Mobs]] that live in [[Mermhouse]]s, which are found in [[Marsh]]es. They are covered in dark green scales, and have bulging eyes, gaping mouths, and gills on the sides of their heads.

### Behavior
Merms spawn from Mermhouses, which can be found in Marsh Biomes. They also spawn in specific set pieces, including a set piece where they spawn with pigs, resulting in them fighting. A Mermhouse can house up to 4 Merms, and it respawns a Merm in 4 days after it's killed. During the [[Day]], only 1 Merm per Mermhouse is normally outside (unless it gets into combat, in which case all the other Merms come out), and when [[Dusk]] comes, all Merms go outside, much like [[Spider]]s.

Merms will only become aggressive if a mob or player gets too close to their house. Similar to [[Pigs]], when they are provoked, they will attack in groups and will kite. They only react to incoming players, [[Pig]]s, [[Bunnyman|Bunnymen]], [[Chester]], [[Hutch]], [[Gobbler]]s, [[Rock Lobster]]s, [[Abigail]], [[MacTusk]]s, [[Wee MacTusk]], and [[Mandrake]]s.

### Hunting
Merms can be kited, very similarly to Pigs. Thanks to the hostile nature of the Marsh Biome, Merms are often discovered in pitched battle with Tentacles, Spiders, or both. For this reason, they make for an excellent source of [[Tentacle Spike]]s, [[Tentacle Spots]], [[Monster Meat]], Fish, Frog Legs, [[Spider Gland]]s, and [[Silk]]: Simply wait for the Merms to finish fighting, then clean up what they leave.

It isn't recommended to fight several Merms at once, as they run faster than the player and will kite, like Pigs. Once the player runs some distance apart from a Merm, it will stop being aggressive and will walk back to its house.

To start a battle between Merms and Tentacles, [[Fruit]]s or [[Vegetable]]s can

It restores 3.3 **Sanity**/min and provides 240 points of protection from **Overheating** while worn.

## Properties

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "It's not lab safe!"
- **Willow**: "I wonder if it'd burn as nicely as actual flowers do."

## Trivia
- The Floral Shirt used to be crafted using **Petals**, **Silk**, and **Butterfly Wings**, and it wasn't as effective against **Overheating**.
- Even though it requires a Cactus Flower to craft (suggesting that is the flower on the shirt), typical "Hawaiian" shirts depict the Hibiscus, the Hawaiian state flower.
