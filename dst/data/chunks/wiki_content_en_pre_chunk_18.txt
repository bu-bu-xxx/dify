# Mushtrees

Mushtrees are naturally generated objects that act as light sources inside **Caves**. They can be found in various colors, each with unique characteristics and spawn conditions.

## Object Infobox
![Mushtree Gallery](Mushtree.png|Blue, Blue Mushtree Blooming.png|Blooming Blue, MushtreeRed.png|Red, Red Mushtree Blooming.png|Blooming Red, MushtreeGreen.png|Green, Green Mushtree Blooming.png|Blooming Green)

- **Renew**: Yes
- **Spawns**: Mushroom Spore / Mushroom Spore / Mushroom Spore
- **Spawn Code**: "mushtree_tall", "mushtree_medium", "mushtree_small"

## Quotes

### Blue Mushtree
- Wilson: "That mushroom got too big for its own good."
- Willow: "Gross. This tree is sick all over."
- Wolfgang: "Big mushtree is big."
- ... (and more)

### Blooming Blue Mushtree
- Wilson: "You can't tell from far away, but it's quite smelly."
- Warly: "What an un-delicious stench!"
- Wigfrid: "An enthusiastic performance!"
- ... (and more)

### Red Mushtree
- Wilson: "These used to grow in my bathroom."
- Warly: "Fresh ingredients, ripe for the taking."
- Wigfrid: "I do like its glow."
- ... (and more)

### Blooming Red Mushtree
- Wilson: "I'm mildly offended by this."
- Warly: "What an un-delicious stench!"
- Wigfrid: "What a great effect!"
- ... (and more)

### Green Mushtree
- Wilson: "A magic mushroom?"
- Warly: "I can't wait to harvest it."
- Wigfrid: "I don't care for mushrooms."
- ... (and more)

### Blooming Green Mushtree
- Wilson: "It's trying to reproduce."
- Warly: "What an un-delicious stench!"
- Wigfrid: "I'll fight alongside you any day!"
- ... (and more)

## Mushtree Mechanics

- The most common variant is Blue Mushtree, which can be chopped down, providing 2 Logs and a Blue Cap.
- Using a Shovel or a Regal Shovel to dig up the stump will provide another Log or burn it to yield 1 Ash.
- Mushtrees also come in green and red varieties, which drop a Green Cap and Red Cap respectively upon harvest, as well as a single Log.
- When set on fire, a Mushtree will eventually burn to a crisp and disappear, dropping 1 Ash and 1 Charcoal.
- During Full Moons, Mushrooms (both in Caves and on the Surface) will turn into Mushtrees.
- Mushtrees have a blooming state where they produce light-generating Spores. The blooming season is different for each variety.

### Shadow Rift Content
Under Acid Rain, small acid stains will appear on them, indicating that the acid is corroding them. In this case, slightly spoiled mushrooms will fall out of the Mushtree.

## Webbed Blue Mushtree
A variant of the Blue Mushtree, called the Webbed Blue Mushtree, can be found near Dangling Depth Dweller dens. Each den will convert surrounding blue mushtrees at a rate of 1 per day up to a maximum of 6. Webbed Blue Mushtrees will spawn spiders from nearby dens when chopped at with an axe.

## Tips
Chopping down Mushtrees is an easy way to get caps while in the caves. However, Mushtrees also provide a small but free and unending source of light. Illumination frequently means life or death in the caves, so discretion should be used when deciding whether or not to harvest.

## Trivia
- According to Wickerbottom and Wagstaff, Mushtrees are regular trees infected with fungal parasites.
- The fungal genus "Mycena" is known in real life for their bioluminescence.
- "Luxeterna" translates to English as "eternal light", and "silvaelucens" translates to "bright forest".

# Regal Shovel

## Structure Infobox
- **Equip Slot:** Hands
- **Name:** Regal Shovel
- **Image:** Regal Shovel Dropped.png
- **Icon:** Regal Shovel.png
- **Tier:** 2
- **Tab:** Tools
- **Ingredient 1:** Twigs
  - **Multiplier 1:** 4
- **Ingredient 2:** Gold Nugget
  - **Multiplier 2:** 2
- **Damage:** 17
- **Durability:** 100 uses (Dig)
- **Dropped By:** Shipwrecked: X Marks The Spot Ocean (Trawl Net)
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** "goldenshovel"
- **Perk:** Used for digging
- **Description:** Lasts longer, digs the same stuff.

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** I can't wait to dig holes.
- **Willow:** It won't make flaming pits, but at least it's shiny.
- **Wolfgang:** Fancy shovel is good hole maker.
- **Wendy:** At least I can dig with style. One might as well dig with style. (DST)
- **WX-78:** GOLD IS MORE DURABLE?
- **Wickerbottom:** The most malleable of metals, but let's see how this digs.
- **Woodie:** Time to dig golden holes.
- **Maxwell:** This shovel is worth a princely sum.
- **Wagstaff:** Strangely more durable than its stone counterpart.
- **Wigfrid:** Digging like a king!
- **Webber:** We're gonna dig so many holes.
- **Walani:** I'm digging this fancy shovel.
- **Warly:** Shiny.
- **Woodlegs:** Perfect for buryin' me treasures.
- **Wilba:** 'TIS BIG SHOVEL O' SHINY
- **Wormwood:** Pretty digger
- **Wheeler:** A little gaudy for my taste.
- **Winona:** A little too snazzy for my taste.
- **Wortox:** Luxuriously unnecessary! Hyuyu!
- **Wurt:** Fancy tool for digging in dirt.
- **Choose:** Walani; Walter: Instead of digging up gold, I can dig with gold!; Wanda: If I have to spend time digging holes, I can at least be fancy.

The **Regal Shovel** is a variant of the normal **Shovel** that has four times as much durability and requires Gold instead of Flint. It requires 2 **Gold Nuggets** and 4 **Twigs** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. Regal Shovel has 100 uses, 4 times as many as regular shovel. It deals the same 17 damage on each strike as the normal Shovel.

## Usage
To dig up an **item** with the Shovel, right-click it from the inventory to equip it and right-click on the object. The player will dig up the object and an item will appear on the ground.

Shovels can be used to dig up Plants such as **Berry Bushes**, **Grass**, and **Saplings** in order to replant them in a more desirable location (usually closer to a base camp).

Shovels can also uproot Tree stumps for 1 **Log**, regardless of their size, and chopped **Mushtrees**, also for 1 Log. They can dig up **Rabbit Holes**, but doing so will permanently remove the hole and prevent any more rabbits from spawning at that particular spot. Additionally, the Shovel can be used to dig up **Graves** to acquire **Gravedigger Items** at the cost of -10 **Sanity** per Grave dug.

The digging animation for the Shovel can be cut short by moving after the player digs up anything. This speeds up the process of mass-clearing objects when holding spacebar.

## Trivia
In reality, gold is not a practical metal to be used in tools or weapons as it's a soft metal; it would easily deform and break. This is often remarked when examined by some **Characters**.

A Seashell is a resource found in the Shipwrecked DLC. They are used in the crafting of several recipes. They can be found frequently in Beach biome, near the shore. Once picked, it will be eligible to regenerate at its original spawn point after 2 days, and will then regenerate when the Tides at night reach that spot. If the spawn location of the Seashell is Flooded during Monsoon Season, the Seashell will not spawn.

Picking up Seashells increases Sanity (+5) in the same way picking Flowers does.

# Switcherdoodles

**Don't Starve Together Exclusive Item**

Switcherdoodles are 7 character-exclusive **Items** craftable by **Webber** in the **Survivor Items Filter**, only in **Don't Starve Together**.

To unlock the recipe, Webber needs to befriend the Spider type he wants to make a Switcherdoodle of.

Switcherdoodles don't work if the spider type is the same as the Switcherdoodle, for example: A Warrior Switcherdoodle won't work if the Spider is already a warrior.

If a hat is on the spider, it will be removed after the transformation and will have to be put back on manually.

They can also be eaten by any survivor (with the exception of Wurt), recovering a small amount of hunger, but also reducing their health and sanity. Webber won't receive any drawbacks from eating it, as it is monster food.

**Drops**: Leafy Meat (normal), Dragon Fruit (ripe)  
**Spawn Code**: "fruitdragon"  
**Health**: 900  
**Emits Light**:  
**Lunar Aligned**: 1

### Behavior
Saladmanders will claim a Hot Spring as their own and will occasionally fall asleep near it. They regenerate 5 Health per second while sleeping. If another Saladmander tries to approach a claimed Hot Spring, its owner will run towards them and the two will attempt to intimidate the other into submission by hissing at each other for some time. Shortly after, the "loser" will run away while the "winner" claims the spring. If a Hot Spring has had a Bath Bomb thrown into it, a Saladmander near it will become hot enough to turn ripe shortly.

The player can speed up the ripening process by setting any heat source near the Salamander, for example, a Campfire.

If the player has a Thermal Stone that is at least somewhat hot within their inventory, Saladmanders will hiss at each other until one leaves, and from then they will begin to follow the player until they fall asleep or the thermal stone loses its heat.

### Fighting
Saladmanders both Ripe and Unripe have both high health and high damage. However, they are slow and have a short range. They can not be stunlocked, but can be kited with 2-3 strikes. Their propensity for sleep can be used to land a few hits. They don't assist each other, so one can attack a Saladmander even if there are other Saladmanders around without having to fear a group attack. Upon death, it drops one Leafy Meat in normal form and one Dragon Fruit in Ripe form. Ripe Saladmanders have a flame attack that can set things within 3.5 range around them on fire, and dealing 25 fire damage to them which can't be mitigated by Armor. This flame attack has a cooldown of 6 seconds.

## Wormwood's Saladmander
![Saladmander Item](Saladmander_Item.png)

**Damage**: 40  
**Attack Period**: 2  
**Attack Range**: 2  
**Walk Speed**: 0.5  
**Run Speed**: 2  
**Drops**: Dragon Fruit  
**Health**: 600  
**Emits Light**:  
**Lunar Aligned**: 1  
**Ingredient 1**: Dragon Fruit  
**Multiplier 1**: 1  
**Ingredient 2**: Health Decrease  
**Multiplier 2**: 25 (Wormwood only)  
**Filter**:  
**Skill**: Lunar Cultivator III  
**Skill Owner**: Wormwood

Wormwood with the Lunar Cultivator III Skill can summon a Saladmander follower at the cost of a Dragon Fruit and 25 HP. Wormwood can have a maximum of 2 Saladmander followers at a time.

Unlike regular Saladmanders:
- They are slightly smaller.
- They have 600 Health, and regenerate 5 Health every 2.5 seconds.
- They deal 40 damage.
- They don't sleep.
- They cannot drop Souls.

Wormwood's Saladmanders will engage in combat if their summoner targets an enemy, if an enemy damages their summoner or if they themselves are attacked. After 16 minutes (2 in-game days), or if killed or unsummoned by being attacked, they turn back into a Dragon Fruit.
These creatures cannot drop souls.

## Trivia
- Saladmanders were introduced in the "Turn of Tides" update.
- As of the "Turn of Tides" update, they use Merm attack sounds and Grass Gekko hurt and death sounds.
- Saladmanders can be created again via Steeped Lunar Essence from the Mad Scientist Lab. Making them renewable even if all of them were killed in the lunar island. They can be relocated and fenced in base. Putting a Scaled furnace will cause them to ripen.

# Siesta Lean-to

## Exclusivity
- **Reign of Giants** | **Shipwrecked** | **Hamlet** | **Don't Starve Together**

## Structure Information
- **Image**: Siesta Lean-to Build.png
- **Icon**: Siesta Lean-to.png
- **Spawn Code**: "siestahut"
- **Ingredients**:
  - Silk: 2
  - Boards: 4
  - Rope: 3
- **Healing**: 60
- **Hunger Bonus**: -25
- **Sanity Bonus**: 50
- **Tab**: Survival
- **Tier**: 2
- **Tool**: Can be Hammered {{pic|32|Hammer}}
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes (1)
- **Durability**: 10 uses
- **Perk**: Lowers temperature and raises Sanity and Health at the expense of Hunger

## Description
The Siesta Lean-to is a craftable Structure from the ''Reign of Giants'' DLC. It requires 2 Silk, 4 Boards, and 3 Rope to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The player can sleep inside the Siesta Lean-to only during the day. Doing so will advance the time to Dusk and set the player's current temperature to 15°C, but only if the player's temperature is above 35°C. This makes it very handy for Summer, where Heat is the most prominent threat, and dusk and night are a lot shorter than the other times of the day. Functioning similarly to the Tent, sleeping in the Siesta Lean-to will restore 60 health and 50 sanity at the cost of 25 hunger and has 6 uses (15 uses in Don't Starve Together). Wickerbottom cannot use the Siesta Lean-to due to her insomnia.

## Quotes
- Wilson: A nice place for an afternoon rest out of the heat.
- Willow: They taught us how to make these in Girl Scouts.
- Wolfgang: Napping place.
- Wendy: A siesta is but a preview of death.
- WX-78: I CAN HIBERNATE MY SESSION IN THERE
- Wickerbottom: I can barely sleep on a bed, nevermind the ground.
- Wigfrid: A place to rest my battle-weary head.
- Woodie: Naps are important during a long day of chopping.
- Maxwell: Rustic, but excellent shade.
- Wagstaff: For indulging in the therapeutic properties of a nap.
- Webber: Is it nap time?
- Walani: I could use a snooze.
- Warly: Comes in handy after a big lunch.
- Woodlegs: I hate sleeping on land.
- Wilba: FOR NAPPING WITHIN
- Wormwood: Nap time?
- Wheeler: For little day trips to dreamland.
- Winona: What sort of bonehead sleeps during the day?!
- Wortox: I could catch a wink, I think.
- Wurt: Wanna take a nap! Nap right here...
- Walter: A shady spot for a quick nap.
- Wanda: I could stand to spend a moment or two out of the heat.

## Tips
- One could have the Siesta Lean-to prebuilt in case of emergency overheating. It may then be placed to cool down, while also giving some sanity and health. This way of using the Lean-to should only be used if one does not have an Endothermic Fire Pit ready, as the structure has a limited amount of uses and costs time.
- In singleplayer, a Siesta Lean-to combined with tents, can be used together to avoid seasonal bosses and even entire seasons if one has the materials and food available.

## Trivia
- A siesta is a short nap taken during midday in some countries with hotter climates.
- A lean-to is a type of shelter that consists of rafters leaning against a wall or structure forming a roof. Lean-tos are associated with camping and wilderness survival.

# Scaled Chest

![Scaled Chest Build](Scaled Chest Build.png) ![Scaled Chest](Scaled Chest.png)

The **Scaled Chest** is a craftable container in the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC. It requires an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype and costs 1 **Scale**, 4 **Boards**, and 10 **Gold Nuggets** to craft. Unlike the regular **Chest**, the Scaled Chest is fireproof and has 12 slots, as opposed to the normal Chest's 9 slots.

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: Next best thing to a lockbox!
- **Willow**: I'm not sure why you'd want something that DOESN'T burn...
- **Wolfgang**: Chest is not afraid of fire.
- **Wendy**: Boom box.
- **WX-78**: CAN HANDLE EXTREMELY HIGH TEMPERATURES
- **Wickerbottom**: Scales! Scales are the winner!
- **Woodie**: Gaudy if you ask me.
- **Maxwell**: Those scales sure are nifty.
- **Wagstaff**: The contents are currently incombustible.
- **Wigfrid**: This chest is wörthy öf my weapöns.
- **Webber**: It looks like my old toy chest!
- **Walani**: What did I get?!
- **Warly**: Ooh la la, burnproof storage.
- **Woodlegs**: 'Tis keepin me treasures safe n'sound.
- **Wilba**: WILBA STUFF NAUGHT FWOOSH HENCE
- **Wormwood**: Fire Safe
- **Wheeler**: Who doesn't need a fireproof chest?
- **Winona**: For the snootiest of snoots.
- **Wortox**: Chest to impress.
- **Wurt**: Like look of this box, florpt.
- **Walter**: We'll have to find something worthy of going in there.
- **Wanda**: Now that I'm not worried about my things burning up, I can worry about everything else.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Hamlet** DLC, the Scaled Chest crafting recipe is unavailable, however, a **Blueprint** for it can be bought with 200 **Oinc**s from **The Tinkerer's Tower**. The Scales are available at **The Sty Oddities Emporium**. Additionally, the Scaled Chest can be opened by **Pogs**.

## Tips

- While Scaled Chests may seem desirable for a hot **Summer**, due to the risk of spontaneous combustion and the **Dragonfly**'s natural vandalism for **Ashes**, it is probably best to use Scales to craft **Scalemail** first, since the Dragonfly becomes much easier to fight after Scalemail is acquired, and in later Summers, the player may have enough gold to mass-produce Scaled Chests.
- The same functionality can be achieved with **Piggyback**s, with the only drawback being that players have to constantly equip and unequip the Piggybacks to check the items inside of them.

# Bug B'Gone

- **Wendy**: For murdering bugs.

- **Woodlegs**: A land cannon for the wee buggies.
- **Wilba**: IT KILLETH THE TEENY BUGS.
- **Wormwood**: Smells bad
- **Wheeler**: This'll keep those tiny flyers grounded.

## Description
**Bug B'Gone** is a craftable item exclusive to the **Hamlet** DLC. It is found in the **Survival Tab**, requires 6 **Tuber**s and a **Flytrap Stalk** to craft, and an **Science Machine** to prototype.

Its main use is to kill **Gnat Swarm**s and **Rabid Beetle**s. Gnats cannot be killed with a regular weapon (unless they are frozen beforehand), while any Rabid Beetle that runs through the cloud will die instantly. It can also be used to ease a fight by reducing the health of enemies a little bit.

Another Use of the Bug B'Gone is to kill most bug-type creatures. Currently, the cloud this creates will apply "strong" poison to **Weevole**s, **Scorpion**s, **Mant**s, **Butterfly**s, **Bee**s and **Mosquito**s, which cause them to take 60 damage directly, and then take 30 damage per 10 second.

The cloud is harmful to the player too, as it will cause them to take 5 damage per second from poisoning for as long as they stay inside the cloud, similar to staying in the **Gas Rainforest** biome without a **Gas Mask**. Note that the player can stay in the Noxious Cloud without taking damage if they wear a Gas Mask.

## Description

Reeds are harvestable **Plants** typically found in **Marsh** **Biomes**. They can be harvested to receive 1 **Cut Reeds**. Once cut, they will need 3 **days** to regrow, but will not regrow during **Winter**.

Reeds cannot be dug up and relocated like **Grass Tufts** or **Saplings**. They are flammable and will leave behind 1 **Ashes** when burned. They also cannot be uprooted by bosses, such as the **Bearger**.

Being found in one of the most hostile biomes in the game, harvesting Reeds is much more dangerous than most other materials, due to the **Tentacles**, **Mosquitoes**, **Spiders**, and **Merms** that dwell there.

There is a **Set Piece** known as **Reed Trap**, which is a thick patch of Reeds where a dense presence of **Tentacles** can also be found.

## Downloadable Content

In **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants**, Reeds can also be found in **Tumbleweeds**.

In the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, Reeds can also be found on the islands.

In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, Reeds can be found growing in the water of **Lily Ponds**. They can only be harvested by using a **Boat**.

## Trivia

- According to **Wickerbottom**, the reeds belong to the rush family **Juncaceae**, even though species in the family are not used to produce paper. The family Juncaceae is often confused with the sedge family **Cyperaceae**, which contains **Cyperus papyrus** (also known as Paper Reed), a plant the Ancient Egyptians used to create paper.
  - The appearance of the Reed in-game, due to its telltale flower, suggests that the plant belongs to the cattail/reedmace family **Typhaceae**. This family includes the genus **Typha**, which is also used to produce paper.

### Scrapbook Info
A gift graciously bestowed to you by the Queen of the Constant, to enrich your sad, futile little lives. She was even kind enough to prepare costumes and a script!

### Description
The **Stage** is a naturally generating **Structure** in **Don't Starve Together**. It always spawns in a **Set Piece** consisting of tiles of **Lush Carpet** and **Mosaic Flooring**, with a Lectern and two **Prickly Stagehand**s beside it. The Set Piece often spawns in **Triple MacTusk** biome, although it can also spawn elsewhere.

The Stage can be used to act out a few plays. The player can insert a **Playbill** into the Lectern to change the play. One of the plays is written by **Charlie** and serves as a metaphor of her life and how she came to rule over **The Constant** from the **Nightmare Throne**.

Players can interact with the Stage to begin the play, but they must have the correct **Costumes** and number of characters. Examining the Lectern shows the required characters for the next act.

If there isn't enough players to fulfill the needs for the entire cast, **Mannequin**s wearing the costumes can substitute for them. Excess Mannequins are ignored, and they must be built on the Stage to count as performers: the Set Piece comes with a single Mannequin off-stage, which holds a complete Doll costume to start the players off.

### Plays

# Berry Bushes

Berry Bushes are commonly found in Grasslands and occasionally Forests. They can be harvested to receive 1 Berries, after which they will need from 3 to 5 Days to regrow. Berry Bushes can be dug up with a Shovel and replanted in a new location. Doing this will require the bush to be fertilized before it will regrow any new Berries.

- **Spawns**: Gobbler (Don't Starve icon), Snake (Shipwrecked icon)

## Exclusivity

Berry Bushes are exclusive to Don't Starve, Reign of Giants, Shipwrecked, Hamlet, and Don't Starve Together.

## Quotes

- Wilson: Red berries taste the best.
- Willow: Mmmmm. Berries.
- Wolfgang: Is full of food-balls!
- ... (and more quotes from other characters)

## Usage

Berry Bushes can be used to craft a Bush Hat.

## Tips

- One cooked berries provide 12.5 hunger, and at most berry bushes require 5 days to regrow, one may need roughly 30 berry bushes to fully self sustain hunger off of berries alone.
- Allowing Roasted Berries to become Rot on the ground can be a quick source of fertilizer to renew the bushes themselves.

## Trivia

- Withered Berry Bushes share the same model as the Barren Berry Bushes.
- Wickerbottom states that the plant is an Ardisia crenata, aka the Christmas Berry, which is suspected to be poisonous to pets, livestock, and/or humans.

The wearer will dig up turf they are standing on and place turf when it is loaded with turf items.

## Additional Information
The Turf-Raiser Helm is a piece of clothing exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It was added in the **A Little Drama** update. It is a head slot item that can be crafted with a **Rare Blueprint** that drops after killing an **Antlion** or giving her a **Beach Toy Trinket** (drops the Lazy Deserter as well as the Turf-Raiser Helm Blueprint). The trinket can be found inside of **Crumpled Packages** which are fished from the **Oasis** during **Summer**.

When equipped, the helmet automatically digs up **turfs** the survivor wearing the helm moves over. The helmet also comes with a slot that accepts turf. When turf is placed in this slot, the helm will place that turf item when a survivor moves over bare ground. The helmet spends 1% durability for every 4 **tiles** of turf dug or laid, allowing the helm to alter 400 cells in total.

# Nomadic Play Strategy

Currently, there are two characters that promote nomadic play: [Walani] and [Warly]. Depending on the character you choose, your priorities for building your home base may differ.

## Strategy Overview

This strategy revolves around creating a main base and smaller bases, referred to as docks. Given that all materials needed to construct a [Chiminea] are potentially renewable (although flint and gold shortages may eventually occur), it is advisable to build at least one Chiminea per island, with additional Chimeneas for larger islands. Each dock must also include a chest to store necessary fuel and other essential supplies.

# Silk

_Silk_ is a resource mainly obtained from [[Spiders]]. It can be used to make many useful items like the Sanity-restoring [[Top Hat]], the [[Boomerang]], the [[Winter Hat]] for moderate warmth, the [[Fishing Rod]], and [[Bird Trap]]s, among other things.

## Gathering
Silk is typically gathered by killing any type of Spider. Its drop rate is approximately 25%. Silk is also dropped in bulk when a [[Spider Den]] is destroyed by any means except burning, in which case all its drops turn to [[Ashes]]. A large den yields 6 pieces of Silk, a medium den yields 4 pieces, and a small den 2. [[Spider Queen]]s drop 4 Silk (and a [[Spiderhat]]) when killed.

| Source | Silk Amount | Drop Chance |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Various Spiders | 1 | 25% |
| [[Spider Den]] | 2 / 4 / 6 | 100% |
| [[Shattered Spider Hole]] | 1 / 2 | 100% |
| [[Sea Strider Nest]] | 1 | 100% |
| [[Spider Queen]] | 4 | 100% |
| [[Silky Beard]] | 1 / 3 / 6 | 100% |
| [[Catcoon]] (Befriended) | 1 | 5.13% |
| [[Tumbleweed]] | 1 | 1% |
| [[Spilagmite]] | 1 | 25% |
| [[Relic Chair]] | 1 | 1% |
| [[Slotmachine]] | 5 | N/A |
| [[A Smashing Pot]] | 1 | 2% |
| [[Spider Monkey]] | 1 | 25% |
| [[Webbed Blue Mushtree]] | 1-3 | 30% |
| [[Cocooned Tree]] | 1 / 2 / 2 | 100% |

## Downloadable Content
In the ''[[Reign of Giants]]'' DLC, Silk can be harvested from [[Tumbleweed|Tumbleweeds]]. Also, [[Webber]] can harvest silk by shaving his beard.

In the ''[[Don't Starve: Hamlet]]'' DLC, Silk drops both from killed [[Spider Monkey]]s (at a 25% rate) and from chopped-down [[Cocooned Tree]]s: 1 piece for a small tree, and 2 for a medium or large tree. Silk can also be bought from [[Pig Shops|'The Sty' Oddities Emporium]] for 5 [[Oinc]]s.

## Usage
Silk is used in various recipes to craft different items. Here are some examples:

- [[Glossamer Saddle]]
- [[Fishing Rod]]
- [[Bird Trap]]
- [[Bug Net]]
- [[Umbrella]]
- [[Piggyback]]
- [[Puffy Vest]]
- [[Sewing Kit]]
- ... and many more.

## Farming
Lone Spiders can be dangerous, but they can be easily dispatched with any Weapon. Each hit briefly stuns them, so Spiders cannot strike attackers back between consecutive hits. For dealing with clutters of Spiders, the proper fighting equipment ([[Log Suit]] and [[Spear]] in the early game) can give the player an easier time.

Traps can also ease Silk farming from Spiders. Spiders and Spider Warriors make no attempts to avoid Traps, so they can be lead directly into them. Spiders are killed instantly when the Trap gets picked up, leaving their loot behind.

It is a good strategy to bring a Spider Den closer to home by destroying a large Spider Den and planting its Spider Egg near the player's base. This would allow the player to have a steady stream of Spiders. If a den is planted near a large Pig Village, the Pigs will kill the Spiders, leave their Silk on the ground, and ignore the den.

Unless the player wants a Spiderhat, any Spider Den should be quickly destroyed if it grows too large. Each large den has a chance of growing into a Spider Queen after 12.5 days. As large dens drop Spider Eggs at any time, the Queen is a danger one shouldn't have to deal with.

# Time To Domesticate

A beefalo has 375 total hunger, and a beefalo consumes 300 hunger per day (4 dragonpies).

1 twig = 1 berries; and 1 grass = 1/2 berries. So, don't bother (not for purposes of feeding).

Every 10 seconds: if the beefalo has **hunger > 0** OR **is being ridden**, it gets a small positive "tick" towards domestication. You can get 48 of these per default day, since the default day lasts 480 seconds.

Every 48 "ticks" = 5% domestication. So a beefalo that never goes fully hungry (hunger always above 0) will be domesticated in 20 game days. If you **also** brush the beefalo once per day, this will reduce to 15 days. You can only get the brushing bonus up to once per day.

Due to a current bug, the beefalo tendency only updates on server restart or when beefalo is fully domesticated, so don't get sad if after 19 days and 76 dragonpies it still looks normal.

# Tendencies

Ornery (more dmg): beefalo has to hit a lot and/or get hit a lot. Damage doesn't matter, only number of hits. Hint: go for bees.

Rider (more riding time): spend a lot of time on the beefalo.

Pudgy (sanity aura): beefalo has to eat when not very hungry (above 50% food-in-belly). Food hunger value is what counts.

The beefalo asks for food (begging animation) when hunger is low (under 45%). So whenever he stops asking for food you should stop feeding it **if you don't want a pudgy one**. If you **want an ornery one**, whatever time you spend on the beefalo should be focused towards getting hit and hitting (and not just riding around, else you get **rider**).

You need a lot of points in tendencies, and you need main tendency to be larger than the sum of the other two. If you don't, you will get a "default" beefalo upon domestication (medium dmg, medium riding time, etc. No sanity aura)

# Getting On The Beefalo

Regardless of domestication level and tendency, beefalo has to be **obedient** to allow you to mount. Everytime you feed it something or brush it, it gets more obedient. Feeding (any food he eats, including grass/twigs) increases obedience by 10%. Brushing increases by 40%. I think we all agree that it's way cheaper to give it 4 twigs than to use a brush, right? Right. Obedience decreases by 1% every 10 seconds, so as soon as you feed a wild beefalo its obedience starts dropping (and will be at 9% for 10 seconds, then 8% for 10 seconds, and so on).

10% obedience: allows you to put a saddle

40% obedience: keeps the saddle

50% obedience: allows you to mount

So, **besides properly feeding your beefalo**, you should always give your beefalo some cheap food before trying to saddle and mount.

# Staying On The Beefalo

Obedience does not dictate how long you can stay mounted. The time you stay mounted is dependent on domestication level (which isn't very obvious). Also: shaved beefalos and mating-season beefalos allow you less time on the saddle; completely domesticated beefalos allow you more time on the saddle.

Ex 1: A completely wild, not shaven, not in heat beefalo allows 15 seconds of riding.

Ex 2: A fully domesticated, not shaven, not in heat beefalo allows 800 seconds of riding.

Yes, you read that right. That's almost 2 days of in-game time.

# Keeping The Beefalo Domesticated

Feed it a few grass/twigs every day and ride it for at least 10 seconds every day. That should be enough. If you choose to abandon your loving pet, here is how you recover:

Remember that every 10 seconds the game checks to see if the beefalo is fed? Each of these is a "tick". Every day you don't feed it, the beefalo loses 2.5 ticks x the number of days it hasn't been fed. So on the first day it hasn't been fed it loses 2.5, on the second it loses 5, on the third it loses 7.5 and so on. You need to add these up (so 3 days is 15 ticks: 2.5 + 5 + 7.5), **always round up**, and feed it 7 hunger value for every tick

Knobbly Trees are [[Plants]] exclusive to [[Don't Starve Together]] and introduced in the [[Waterlogged]] beta. They can be found in the [[Waterlogged]] biome. They can be grown from Knobbly Tree Nuts and can be chopped down with any Axe; a basic Axe will need 10 swings to cut it.

The Growth stages take 3 days from planting to short, and roughly 4 days for each other phase. If unenriched, they revert back to the short phase after the tall one. When at its tall stage, [[Tree Jam]] can be used to enrich it, making it appear goopy. After 4 days, the tree will grow one flower and will be able to be enriched again. This can be repeated, gaining a flower each time. Instead of gaining a fourth flower, if enriched, it grows into an Above-Average Tree Trunk.

- ...  
- Choose: Wortox

Knobbly Tree Nuts are dropped from [[Great Tree Trunk]]s after being rammed into by a [[Boat]]. A Knobbly Tree Nut can be taken out of the water using a [[Pinchin' Winch]], and can be placed back on the Pinchin' Winch to drop back into the water. After spending about 2 days in the water, it will grow into a Knobbly Tree's first stage.

Another way to drop the nut back into water is by destroying the Boat that has a nut on it. Place the nut at a desired location on a Boat and destroy the Boat by creating leaks or burning it down. An even cheaper way to accomplish this is with the [[Grass Raft Kit|Grass Raft]], which will automatically lose health and sink, but can be burned by the impatient by overloading a campfire.

Knobbly Tree Nuts can be destroyed by [[Hammer]] to yield a stick.

# Fish Farm

## Exclusivity
Shipwrecked

## Description
The **Fish Farm** is a craftable structure introduced in the "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked" DLC. It is found in the Food Tab, requires a Science Machine to prototype, and 2 Silk, 2 Rope and 4 Coconut to craft. It needs to be stocked using Roe to produce either Tropical Fish, Purple Grouper, Pierrot Fish, or Neon Quattro.

## Structure Infobox
- **Icon**: Fish Farm.png
- **Image**: Fish Farm Build.png
- **Description**: Grow your own fish food with roe!
- **Ingredient 1**: Silk (multiplier 2)
- **Ingredient 2**: Rope (multiplier 2)
- **Ingredient 3**: Coconut (multiplier 4)
- **Tab**: Food
- **Spawns**:
  - Sea Hound (Deep Ocean, Medium Ocean, 70% chance)
  - Crocodog
  - Viper Lilly Pond
- **Tier**: 1
- **Spawn Code**: "fish_farm"

## Quotes
- Wilson: "I need to find some fish eggs for this."
- Willow: "I gotta put something in there to grow fish."
- Wolfgang: "Need little fishie eggs!"
- Wendy: "Life can't come from nothing... I need something..."
- WX78: "COMPLETELY LIFELESS. GOOD"
- Wickerbottom: "I must find roe if I'm to raise captive fish."
- Woodie: "Need to get ahold of fish eggs for that."
- Maxwell: "I need some fish eggs if I want fish."
- Wagstaff: "Entirely devoid of fish at the moment."
- Wigfrid: "The goddess Ran has blessed me with her net."
- Webber: "No fishies."
- Walani: "I guess I gotta find fish eggs now. Oof."
- Warly: "I'll have to sacrifice caviar ingredients for this."
- Woodlegs: "Nary a fish in sight!"
- Wilba: "WHEREFORE LITTLE FISHY?"
- Wormwood: "Where glub glubs?"
- Wheeler: "Swell. A fish farm without any fish."
- Choose: Warly

## Farm Stages
The amount of fish shown in a Fish Farm indicates its current growth stage, and how many fish can be harvested.

| Fish shown | Fish Available |
|-----------|---------------|
| 0         | 0             |
| 1         | 1             |
| 3         | 2             |
| 5         | 3             |
| 6         | 4             |

## Prototype Tips
- Once the Fish Farm has been harvested for the first time, the color of the fish on the small sign changes to represent the kind of fish this farm stocks: Blue for Tropical Fish, purple for Purple Grouper, yellow for Pierrot Fish, and cyan for Neon Quattros. Before a newly stocked Fish Farm has been harvested, the sign is orange.
- Fish Farms can be plundered by Crocodog, which will result in loss of fish stages (each producing a fish that will be eaten), until they are completely empty. Sea Walls can be used for protection.
- Fish Farms can be pre-crafted in a Shipwrecked world and brought over to a Hamlet world, where they can be placed in a Lily Pond and produce the same types of fish if stocked with Roe.

## Trivia
- Fish Farms were added to the Shipwrecked DLC more than a year after its official completion in the Home Sea Home update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.
- The three fish that can only be obtained from Fish Farms are required to cook the Tropical Bouillabaisse.
- According to the game files, it seems there was originally going to be a 5th type of fish that could be grown in the farm, the "Spotted Wanda".
- In the code, the four growth stages are called "one fish", "two fish", "red fish", and "blue fish". This is a reference to the book One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish by Dr. Seuss. In addition, Wilba's quotes reference this, in the specific order. (Ex. Red = First stage Blue = second, etc.)

- **Wanda**: Something's nagging at the back of my brain... I'm sure it's nothing.

## Description
Suspicious Moonrocks are naturally spawning objects exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in A New Reign. They are Moon Rock-made sculptures shaped like Werepigs and Hounds and can be found scattered around the Moon Stone set piece. Mining them with a Pickaxe will yield one Moon Rock plus 50% to get one extra. 

Additionally, after placing a Star Caller's Staff onto the Moon Stone during a Full Moon, several Werepigs and Hounds will spawn and attack the Staff. After breaking the base, all of them will turn into Suspicious Moonrock sculptures. They will turn once again into the corresponding Mobs if the base is fixed and the staff is put back on it.

There are three different appearances for the Werepig, corresponding to its attack-, death and howl-animations, and two different appearances for the Hound, corresponding to its attack- and death-animations.

## Tips
One should mine down all Suspicious Moonrocks before attempting to use the Moon Stone again, as it will keep spawning more enemies along with the ones from previous attempts.

## Trivia
Suspicious Moonrocks were introduced in the A Little Fixer Upper update.

## Description
Watery Graves are naturally occurring structures found in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They can be found in the dark colored ship graveyards in the Ocean and can be fished out of the water. Collecting them costs 10 Sanity. When retrieved, they have a 10% chance to spawn a Pirate Ghost. Otherwise, they will always yield a Seaweed. In addition, they may yield a Coral (75% chance) and a random Trinket (50% chance). If the Bone Key, one of the keys needed to unlock the playable Woodlegs character, does not exist in the world yet, each Watery grave will have a chance to contain it. This chance is equal to 1 / (Number of Watery Graves left in the world), meaning the key is guaranteed to be obtained by fishing all the Watery Graves.

During Full Moons, a Watery Grave will spawn a Pirate Ghost.

## Trivia
- Watery Graves were introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#February 25, 2016 - Release the Quacken Update**.

## Description
'Spider Eggs' are acquired by destroying a Tier 3 [Spider Den] or killing a [Spider Queen]. They can be planted on the ground by picking them up from the inventory and clicking the ground with the right mouse button. This will create a tier 1 Spider Den, which then grows normally.

Spider Eggs can be used to create Spider Dens at any specific place, often an area where one can safely contain the [Spiders] for [Silk] farming. Spider Eggs are also a great fuel for [Campfire]s, adding a lot of burn time.

## Downloadable Content
In the 'Reign of Giants' DLC, [Webber] begins the game with Spider Eggs, and he can craft more with 12 [Silk], 6 [Spider Gland]s, and 6 [Papyrus].

## Trivia
- When removing/inserting Spider Eggs from/into one's inventory, the item makes a squelching noise. In addition, when selected from the inventory, the eggs will make a "Babum" sound.
- Despite what [Wilson] says after inspecting Spider Eggs, they will never hatch unless the player manually plants them.
- The description for this recipe may be a reference to the Beatles' song "With a Little Help from My Friends".
- Wx-78's quote "SPIDER POTENTIAL = 6" is the number of spiders that can live in a tier 2 den and the number of legs all spiders have in-game.
- If paired with a few [Rabbit Hutch]es, Spider Eggs can be turned into a reliable spider farm.

## Trivia
- The original Celestial Tab was introduced in the Celestial Update. With the introduction of Crafting Filters in the March 2022 QoL update, it was replaced by the Celestial Filter.
- Before the Eye of the Storm update, there were technically two Celestial Filters; One had recipes exclusive to the Celestial Orb and the other, for either the Celestial Altar, Celestial Tribute or Celestial Sanctum.

## Description

Bamboo Patches are plants introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. They are found commonly in the Jungle biome and can be cut down with a Machete to yield one Bamboo. They take 4 days to regrow and are not affected by Winter cold.

Bamboo Patches can be dug up with a Shovel or Regal Shovel, and replanted in a new location. Doing this will give it a shorter, withered appearance, requiring the patch to be fertilized before it will regrow. Dug up Bamboo Patches can also be used as a source of Fuel.

Spending Dubloons at the Slotmachine has a small chance of yielding a Bamboo Patch alongside three Bamboo, making Bamboo Patches a renewable resource.

## Tips

Bamboo has a chance of blowing off a bamboo patch during Strong Winds, which can be taken advantage of during Hurricane Season. Surrounding a bamboo farm with Walls (except Wood or Hay) will make it possible to collect fallen Bamboo without the need of a Machete.

## Description
Shoals are natural occurring objects in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They can be found quite often in Mangrove and Coral Reef biomes, and rarely in the Ocean biome. The player can use a Fishing Rod to fish in them to get Tropical Fish. Shoals can contain a maximum of 10 Tropical Fish, and they spawn with randomly 6 to 10 Tropical Fish remaining. New Tropical Fish are spawned every 4 minutes (half day) if the Shoal contains less than 10. The Shoal's appearance will show less fish if less than 5 Tropical Fish are remaining in it, and it will be invisible if empty. Fishing in Shoals has a 20% chance to spawn Crocodog, so caution is advised.

Shoals naturally alternate between active and inactive periods, active state lasting for 2 days (1 day in Hurricane Season, 3 days in Monsoon Season) and inactive state lasting for 1 day (3 days in Hurricane Season, 0.5 days in Monsoon Season). They will disperse when they have been active for a day and enter the inactive period, unless they are being fished at the moment that they need to disperse. A day after dispersing, they will regroup and become active. Shoals will also disperse if disturbed by sailing over them. Additionally, Strong Winds and Hail will disperse most of the Shoals in the world, making them unreliable as a food source during the Hurricane Season.

## Bugs
- In a Don't Starve: Reign of Giants compatible world, examining Shoal will give the same quotes as examining a Pond.
