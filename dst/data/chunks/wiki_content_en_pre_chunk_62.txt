# Depths Worm

The Depths Worm is a hostile [Mob] found in [Caves] and [Ruins]. Depths Worms will periodically spawn in Caves or Ruins and attack the player, similar to the [Periodic hound attacks] of the surface.

## Periodic Attacks

Before an attack, the player will begin to hear rumbling growls which grow more frequent the closer the attack draws. The older a [world] is, the more frequently attacks will come and the more worms will spawn with each wave.

| Day Range | Next Attack (days) | Count | Advance Warning (seconds) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|--------------------------|
| 0 to 9    | 10 - 17           | 1     | 120                     |
| 10 to 24  | 10 - 17           | 1 - 2  | 60                      |
| 25 to 49  | 8 - 15            | 1 - 2  | 45                      |
| 50 to 99  | 8 - 15            | 2 - 3  | 30                      |
| 100+      | 6 - 11            | 3 - 5  | 30                      |

## Behavior

When it is not engaged with the player, it will seek out areas with harvestable objects then set its lure and lay in wait, or emerge to consume both [meats] and [vegetables]. This lure will appear as a [Mysterious Plant]. If the player attempts to harvest the displayed lure, or remains nearby for too long, the worm will emerge and attack. During this time the main body of the worm resides underground.

## Fighting Strategy

## Shadow Rift Content

If it gets caught in the [Acid Rain] its damage attack will rise to +50%, move speed will rise to +25% and taking damage rises to +25%. The fact that it is subject to the effect can be understood by the special breath that he will emit.

## Tips

- Depth Worms will only trigger a [Tooth Trap] when any part of their body is above ground, that being their animations & attacks. Players will have to repeatedly bait Depth Worms' attacks as the mere 60 damage will only pepper the worms with enameled shrapnel.
- [Pigs] and [Bunnymen] will ensure a safe place from the worms as the Pigs and Bunnies will attack them on sight.
- [Rock Lobsters] are the best option to deal with Depth Worms. A group of 3-4 of them will make quick work of Worm waves even when they're at their maximum size.
- Depths Worms will always follow the same attack pattern: attacking once, followed by a brief resurface, then a second attack followed by no resurface. It is possible to get 4-5 hits in after the first attack, during the initial diving and subsequent surfacing.
- Depths Worms cannot be frozen by an [Ice Staff] but being hit by it will still stun them.
- Despite moving underground, Depths Worms will still be unable to go past [Walls]. They will also not attack the wall even if their target is on the other side.
- Depths Worms attack any mob in sight except for insects and birds, which can be used to the player's advantage. During a Depths Worm attack, the player can let it chase them until it loses interest and looks for a new target.

## Trivia

- During the [Nightmare Cycle] phase of the Ruins, the pinkish purple segments of the worm's fur will become a vibrant red. This is due to a side effect of the Nightmare Cycle, one which causes all traces of red to glow a vibrant, magenta-red color during the active phase.

# Bees

## Overview

Bees are neutral mobs that spawn from Beehives and Bee Boxes. While their aggressive variant - the Killer Bee - is charged with the protection of the nest, the primary function of these normally docile creatures is honey production. If provoked however, they do join fights to defend the hive.

When killed, they drop either 1 Honey or Stinger and increase the player's Naughtiness by 1 point.

Bees can be caught with Bug Net. Starving bees can be fed with food, like Rot.

The optimal way to get a large number of bees would be to burn bee boxes and put out the fire with Ice Flingomatics. All the bees evacuated from bee boxes will be normal bees that are available to capture, and if they are captured quickly, no killer bees will spawn.

## Behavior

Bees are usually seen traveling between their nest and nearby Flowers during the Day. They leave their nest in the morning one at a time at regular intervals and all return home at Dusk or when they have collected pollen from 6 different sources. When they reach a Flower, they will usually land on it for a short time before moving on again. The closer the Flowers are to the nest, the faster the Bees will produce Honey for Bee Boxes. If there are no Flowers nearby or if all Flowers are occupied, Bees will sometimes simply land on the ground and wait.

Peaceful bees do not cross ocean or non-enclosing walls, except to return to their hive at night. All Bees ignore completely enclosing walls, which is different from how Lavae work (it works to enclose each Lava Pool individually). Aggroed bees always ignore walls. If the wall has a door and the door is open during a bee's pathfinding, that bee will ignore the wall for a bit and fly over it, even if the door is closed during the actual flyover. In spring, a normally wall-respecting Bee can aggro on something across a wall, then fly over the wall to fight it.

When their link to a Beehive is severed, like released after being caught, the Bee will be able to propagate a new Flower after pollinating 6 different Flowers. Evil Flowers can also possibly and similarly be grown, with the chance increasing with the number of evil flowers the Bee has pollinated among the 6 flowers the bee had pollinated. Hiveless Bees will pollinate Flowers through Dusk and winter. With each bee likely growing more than 1 flower, bees are more economical for mass production of flowers compared to planting butterfly, provided there are 6 flowers available.

Bees appear red in Spring. However, they can still be used for building Bee Boxes. Red Bees and Killer Bees can be distinguished based on their behavior and origin. Red Bees would be going between the flowers and can only originate from Beeboxes and normal beehives. On the other hand, Killer Bees is either flying after their target, or returning to hive. Red bees are hostile to most other mobs, and players within 4 Tiles.

When harvesting Honey from a Bee Box any Bees inside will aggro and attack, but those already outside will not. It's perfectly safe to harvest a Bee Box if all the Bees are outside, or in winter when bees are dormant.

## Killer Bee

Killer Bees are an aggressive variant of Bees. They spawn from regular Beehives, Killer Bee Hives, and Bee Boxes when attacked, or when a Bee is caught with a bug net nearby.

Killer Bees will attack anything that damages a Beehive or a Killer Bee Hive. All Bees, inside the hive, emerge as Killer Bees and attack, but any Killer Bees that were not in the hive will ignore the threat unless the target fights back. Running away a short distance will de-aggro the killer bees and they will fly towards their nest, but they are aggressive and may decide to attack anything nearby such as Chester or Packim Baggims.

Killer Bees can also be caught with the bug net, however, they are generally useless as materials, as they can't be used for Bee Boxes, but can be relocated to assist in combat.

Killer Bees are hostile towards almost all creatures except flying Birds, Mosquito, Butterfly and players within 8 Tiles.

In combat, Killer Bees are actually weaker than normal Bees, as they have a lower attack speed.

## Combat

Both types of Bees defend fellow member of the same hive; this occurs when a Killer Bee or worker Bee is attacked or caught with a Bug Net. Bees already outside help if they are within 30m while those still inside all leave the hive immediately and attack regardless of distance (though they give up the chase after 8 seconds if they can't reach their target). Bees belonging to different hives do not assist. However, hiveless Bees do

# Wurt

## Character Information
- **Image**: ![Wurt Original Portrait](Wurt_Original_Portrait.png)
- **Health**: 150 or 250
- **Hunger**: 200 or 250
- **Sanity**: 150 or 200
- **Favorite Food**: ![Durian](Durian) and ![Extra Smelly Durian](Extra_Smelly_Durian)
- **Speed**: \( \times1 \) or \( \times1.3 \)
- **Item**: ![Royal Tapestry](Royal_Tapestry) ![Craftsmerm House](Craftsmerm_House) ![Merm Flort-ifications](Merm_Flort-ifications) ![Clever Disguise](Clever_Disguise) ![Marsh Turf](Marsh_Turf)
- **Spawn Code**: `wurt`

## Abilities

Wurt has the unique ability to craft the **Royal Tapestry**, which allows for the creation of the **King of the Merms**. This king boosts the stats of all **Merm**s, **Loyal Merm Guards**, and Wurt herself. Merms and Wurt can recognize the King's presence by a change in physical appearance. By trading **Fishes** with the King, the player can receive various resources including **Kelp Fronds**, **Seeds**, specific **Crop Seeds**, **Cut Reeds**, **Tentacle Spots**, certain **Trinkets**, and **Gold Nuggets** if trading an **Ocean Fish**.

Wurt can also craft **Craftsmerm Houses**, which house Merms, and **Merm Flort-ifications**, which house Loyal Merm Guards. She can befriend Merms by feeding them, and they can aid her in combat, tree chopping, and mining boulders. To include players who are not Merms, she can craft a **Clever Disguise** for them to wear.

Wurt can craft **Marsh Turf**, which increases her movement speed by 30% when walked upon (this boost does not stack with that of **Roads**). She can also detect where **Tentacles** are hiding.

Wurt only gains 50% **Wetness** when **Drowning** in the **Ocean**. She retains her full inventory and none of her stats are affected.

Wurt is immune to most effects of **wetness**; she won't lose sanity when being wet or equipping wet items and has a strong grip, preventing her from dropping slippery items. However, she will still lose temperature when wet.

Creatures that attack **Webber** and **Wortox** are neutral with her. **Frogs** are also neutral with Wurt, as well as other Merms.

**Durians** and **Kelp Fronds** (raw, cooked, or dried) won't cause her to lose Health or Sanity when eaten. Additionally, any **Vegetables**/ **Fruits**/ **Butterfly Wings** will provide her with 33% extra Hunger, with **Durians** providing 93% extra instead.

The **Seawreath**, **Garland**, and **Milkmade Hat** have their sanity effects reversed when worn by Wurt.

Keeping a living **Fish**, **Eel**, **Ocean Fish**, or **Star-Sky** in her inventory grants her 3.3 **Sanity** per minute. Fish held by Wurt will stay alive longer, suffocating at a rate of 0.25, allowing ocean fish to live for up to 4 days and freshwater fish up to 12 days. The sanity increase does not stack if there is more than 1 live fish in the player's inventory.

Wurt can read **Books**, but she won't trigger their effects. Instead, she'll either gain or lose Sanity depending on the book she reads:

| Books | Sanity Change |
| --- | --- |
| ![Birds of the World](Birds_of_the_World) ![On Tentacles](On_Tentacles) ![The Angler's Survival Guide](The_Angler's_Survival_Guide) ![Lux Aeterna Redux](Lux_Aeterna_Redux) | +50 |

It can then be placed on any bare ground tile or used as fuel. Guano Turf can also be crafted and prototyped with 2 Guano at Terra Firma Tamper in the Decorations Filter.

Plants like Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Lureplants, Pine Cones, and Birchnuts can be planted on these Turfs. It will not stop the Lureplants' Eyeplants from spawning.

When placed on the Surface World covering a large enough area, Crows are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs.

## Rockyland
Rockyland is one of the **Biomes** in the game.

### Characteristics
Rockyland is categorized by an abundance of **Boulders** (both normal and gold vein versions) and **Mini Glaciers**, with a combination of **Rocky Turf** and barren turf. This is one of the native habitats of **Tallbirds** and their **Nests**; there can be as many as four or five in the biome. **Redbirds** and **Snowbirds** do not spawn here, only **Crows**.

Rockylands tend to have few plants growing on them, although the occasional **Evergreen Tree**, **Sapling**, or **Grass Tuft** may sneak in on the edge.

Rarely, there is a branch of this biome which is infested with **Spider Dens** packed together, making travel quite dangerous. **Gold Nuggets** may also be found on the ground in this biome branch, making it a good, albeit risky, biome to obtain gold to craft a **Science Machine**.

**Berry Bushes**, **Saplings**, **Grass Tufts**, **Spiky Bushes**, and **Evergreens** cannot be planted on **Rocky Turf**. It must first be removed with a **Pitchfork** in order to plant. This turf can be combined with 1 **Boards** to produce **Cobblestones**, which are placeable **Roads**.

In **Don't Starve Together**, **Grass Gekkos** may spawn in groups in Rockyland. This is also one of the biomes where **Meteors** will fall, alongside the **Mosaic** biome.

# Oasis Desert

- **Game**: Don't Starve Together
- **Biome Name**: Oasis Desert
- **Abundant**: Spiky Bush, Oasis Cactus, Tumbleweed, Flintless Boulder, Crow
- **Occasional**: Bones, Buzzard, Grass Gekko, Volt Goat
- **Rare**: Antlion, Oasis
- **Turf**: Sandy Turf, Dirt
- **Description**: Lightning Bluff

> "It's a wonder anything grows in this climate at all." - Woody

## Overview

The **Antlion Desert**, **Desert**, or **Oasis Desert** is a biome that always spawns in the world. You can distinguish it from the **Badland** by the long **Cactus**es. There, one is guaranteed to find the **Oasis** Set Piece, which features a small circle of **Grass Turf** with 12 **Birchnut Trees** surrounding a dried-up **Lake**, which will spawn 18 **Succulents** during **Summer**; additionally, the Lake will fill up with water during said season with multiple **Fireflies** illuminating it. During Summer, the **Antlion** will spawn in this desert, and **Sandstorms** will occur through this entire desert except in the area of the Oasis.

As nothing in the **Oasis** Set Piece or in Sandstorms will smolder, and the fact that the lake can be fished in for **Fish** and unique drops (such as the blueprints for **Desert Goggles** and the **Red Crown** which can be exchanged with the Antlion for the **Humble Lamb Idol**), it is an ideal area for surviving Summer, provided the player sets up a proper base before the season arrives. Note that an Oasis base can still be set ablaze through burning **Tumbleweeds**.

## Overview
Batilisks are flying mobs which live in caves and are commonly found on Stalagmite Terrains. They come to the surface through unplugged Sinkholes at Dusk and to Caves from unplugged Ruins Sinkholes when it gets dark. They deal a small amount of damage and with most characters take two hits to kill with a Spear or Bat Bat, and one hit with most other melee weapons. They can drop Batilisk Wings, Monster Meat, or Guano when killed. Additionally, Batilisks periodically drop Guano while moving (much like how Beefalo drop Manure). If a Batilisk eats food and the chewing animation is still playing, it is possible to get the food back before the animation ends if you kill it.

## Shadow Rift Content
Acid Rain empowers Batilisks, speeding them up by 25%, increasing their damage by 50%, and changing the loot to Batilisk Wing (50%), Guano (30%), Monster Meat (20%), and Nitre (20%).

## Hunting
Multiple Batilisks will join together and swarm the Characters (and other mobs), circling them. They will let out a cry before breaking their circle to attack and will charge straight at their target, allowing for timed attacks or kiting if multiple choose to attack at one time.

When facing many Batilisks underground, it is often helpful to bring a Bunnyman along for assistance. Batilisks and Bunnymen are naturally aggressive towards each other.

## Tips
- Batilisks can travel approximately 20 pitchfork tiles away from their home sinkhole.
- Batilisks only respawn during Day time. If using a world setting that removes Day time (such as the Lights Out preset) Batilisks will no longer spawn from sinkholes after they have been killed.

## Trivia
- The name "Batilisk" is a portmanteau of "bat" and "basilisk".
- In the first pass ("pre-alpha") of Caves, Batilisk spawn rates were high, leading to swarms of (at one point) 40-50.
- Batilisks used to die immediately after eating Monster Meat due to their low health. This was changed in the All's Well That Maxwell update.
- The fact that fewer Batilisks emerge from the Sinkhole in Winter is based on the fact that bats hibernate during winter.
- Although they cannot be captured, Batilisks have an inventory image in the game's files.

Here are various images of Batilisks in different states and situations.

# Darts

- **Equip Slot:** Hands
- **Perk:** Fires off 8 darts in rapid succession.
- **Dropped By:** Available immediately for some characters.
- **Spawn Code:** `blowdart_lava`
- **Damage:** 20

## Description

Darts are an item added to **The Forge** in **Don't Starve Together**. Available immediately from characters such as Willow, Wilson, Wendy, Wes, and Webber. This item fires projectiles that deal 20 damage to the target. When shooting, it is impossible to miss the enemy. The main ability of the darts is a flurry of darts (Barrage). When used, a character launches 8 darts in a given direction.

## Tips

- Since darts are long-range weapons, you should keep your distance from enemies while firing at them.
- You should focus on enemies whose protection is broken (by the **Forging Hammer** or **Riled Lucy**). This way, the enemy will take more damage. It is also recommended to use a barrage of darts on such enemies.
- If the player with the darts is hit by **Wigfrid**'s warcry, the entire flurry of darts will deal bonus damage.
- Darts left by other players can be rotated to use the flurry more often.

## Infernal Staff

- **Damage**: 25
- **Equip Slot**: Hands
- **Perk**: Summons a meteor that does between 200 to 250 damage to all enemies within spell area, depending on their proximity to the center. (Meteor can force mobs to lower their shields.)
- **Spawn Code**: `fireballstaff`
- **Exclusive to**: Don't Starve Together
- **Event**: The Forge

The **Infernal Staff** is an item added to the **The Forge** event in **Don't Starve Together**. It is dropped by the last enemy killed on wave 7. This item fires fireballs that deal 25 damage to the target. Like darts, these projectiles cannot miss their target.

### Special Ability - Call Cataclysm

When used, a meteor impact area appears, as the meteorite itself falls, dealing high damage in the area from 200 to 250 to all enemies caught in this area. The closer the enemies stand to the center, the more damage they take. Also able to rarely deal critical hits with increased damage by 1.5 times.

The staff deals magic and fire damage, causing Willow's ability and projectile damage to be increased by 10%.

### Tips for Using Infernal Staff

1. The staff's special ability is for crowd control. The staff user is advised to cast the spell on a large cluster of enemies.
2. While casting the spell, it is recommended to stay away from enemy warriors: if they hit the staff owner during the summoning animation, the spell will be canceled.
3. If Willow is on the team, it is recommended to leave the staff to her. Increased fire damage affects both normal attacks and call of cataclysm (220-275).
4. Wickerbottom is also a good user of the infernal staff: good damage helps to quickly strengthen the next spell, and the enhanced call of the cataclysm deals 300-375 damage, which, when wearing a psychic crown, can kill boars from hell in one hit (useful in a boss battle).
5. Another candidate for using the staff is Maxwell: when inflicting 10 attacks on one target, his shadow clones appear, causing good damage with their wave. This can be done with any item; however, attacking via the Codes Umbra, Maxwell may die due to his depleting amount of health, and it is better to leave the staff of life to a character who has bonuses for healing.

# Krampus

**Krampus** (plural **Krampii**) is a neutral monster that steals the player's stored items and items left on the ground. Krampus appears when overzealous hunters gain too much **naughtiness** from killing innocent creatures too fast.

### Stats
- **Health**: 300
- **Diet**: Meat
- **Damage**: 50
- **Drops**: Monster Meat, Charcoal x2, Krampus Sack (1% chance), Stolen items
- **Attack Period**: 1.2
- **Attack Range**: 3
- **Run Speed**: 7
- **Spawn Code**: "krampus"
- **Spawn From**: Klaus

### Special Ability
Steals items

### Quotes
- Wilson: "He's going after my stuff!"
- Willow: "Stay back, you big jerk!"
- Wolfgang: "Scary goat man! Run!"
- Wendy: "Hello, foul creature of the underworld."
- WX-78: "STOP! THIEF!"
- Wickerbottom: "It's a mythological holiday monster."
- Woodie: "Back off, hoser!"
- Maxwell: "You'll never catch me!"
- Wanda: "He really puts a damper on this time of year."
- Wortox: "Heh heh. No hard feelings?"

### Behavior
Krampus moves fairly fast and deals 50 damage per hit. He runs away when approached, similar to the behavior of a Gobbler or MacTusk. He will break Chests to steal items and will pick up most items laying on the ground in the player's vicinity, including any and all types of Backpacks. He will keep running around the player until no more items exist on-screen, then disappear into his sack. Krampus cannot break or steal from Ice Boxes, Drying Racks, Crock Pots or most other structures that can hold items (other than normal Chests).

### Naughtiness
Naughtiness is generated by killing certain creatures (either with a weapon or by "Murdering" them in the inventory). Once the player reaches a threshold of naughtiness (a random number between 31 and 50), Krampus will spawn. After Krampus appears, the naughtiness level is reset to 0.

### Strategy
Krampus, especially when more than one spawns at the same time, can wreak havoc in a player's base without adequate preparation. Players are advised to pay attention to the signs of naughtiness, and only summon Krampus when preparations are complete; away from important items and the player's base.

### Tips
- Summoning Krampus at night will summon sleeping Krampii, including during a Full Moon, which allows them to be easily killed.
- Tooth Traps are not very effective against Krampus since there is a chance that he will steal the trap instead of activating it.
- Various forms of "Krampus traps" can be created utilizing their behavior of stealing items.

### Trivia
- Krampus was added in the "Naughty and Nice" update.
- Krampus is a beast-like creature from the folklore of Alpine countries, thought to punish bad children during the Yule season by whipping them into submission.

# Rabbit Hutches

![Rabbit Hutch](Rabbit Hutch.png)

Rabbit Hutches are craftable **Structures** that spawn naturally in the **Caves**. They can spawn individually, in small randomly spaced groups, or in a large circle around a patch of grass and a **Pitchfork**.

## Crafting
- **Tool Required:** [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype.
- **Materials Needed:**
  - Boards: 4x
  - Carrots: 10x
  - Bunny Puffs: 4x

## Behavior
Rabbit Hutches function similarly to **Pig Houses** but spawn a **Bunnyman** after a day instead of a **Pig** after four days. Bunnymen will only come out of their houses at dusk and go home during the day.

## Farming
Players can farm Bunnymen using **Houndius Shootius** and **Walls**. Build a Houndius Shootius and surround it with Rabbit Hutches. Then build walls around both to prevent Bunnymen from attacking and to limit their escape distance. Command the Houndius Shootius to shoot the Bunnymen during Dusk or Night for a harvest of carrots, meat, and bunny puffs.

## Skins
- **Woven - Elegant Carrat Cottage:** Introduced during the official **Year of the Carrat** event in 2020.
- **Loyal Topsy-Turvy Treehouse:** Awarded for watching 6 hours of **Don't Starve Together** on Twitch from December 16, 2021 to December 30, 2021. Also available in the Klei Rewards shop for 1,200 Klei points.

## Tips
- Place Rabbit Hutches a decent distance from the camp to avoid aggression from Bunnymen when carrying meat items.
- Combine Spider Dens with Rabbit Hutches to create a Spider farm, as Bunnymen are vegetarian and will not eat the Monster Meat dropped by Spiders.

# The Gnaw

The **Gnaw**, also known as the **Eternal Gnaw**, is a creature exclusive to the **[The Gorge]** event. It is a huge gaping mouth in the sky named after its eternal hunger. Its origins are unknown to the inhabitants of the Gorge.[^1] The Gnaw demands to be fed by the residents of the Gorge, threatening them with mermification when not given enough food. The Gnaw's plague of mermification killed off most of the goats in the dimension,[^2] and the remaining ones started worshipping the Gnaw.[^3]

## Behavior

Interactions with the Gnaw are exclusively conducted through the **[The Altar of Gnaw]**, where players snackrifice prepared dishes in exchange for coins and a delay in the Gnaw's punishment. While not directly seen in-game, the Gnaw is visible on the **Hangry Meter** which governs the progress of a round of gameplay. Through the Hangry Meter, players can determine the Gnaw's current mood. Its mood affects the depletion of the Hangry Meter, so it is critical for players to pay attention to it.

When the Gnaw grows more restless, it will cause minor quakes. As the Gnaw's wait for a meal grows longer, it will roar periodically, during which it causes a quake with more intensity. The time between quakes will also become progressively shorter. Once the Gnaw's mouth forms a frown, it has been left waiting for a meal for too long. At this point, the quakes will be quite numerous and the Hangry Meter will begin dropping faster.

Players can also observe what the Gnaw thinks of the dish it ate. It will look happy when it eats a dish that matches the craving, and angry when it eats a dish that does not match the craving. The Hangry Meter will drop drastically and the Gnaw's patience will be shorter when it eats the wrong dish.

If the Hangry Meter reaches its end, the round is lost and the players are transformed into **Merm**s.

## Trivia

* The Gnaw resembles a **Worm Hole**.
* Upon examining the **Dilapidated Cathedral**, **Wickerbottom** determines that the goat people did not worship the Gnaw.[^4] Whether she means that they worshipped a different deity before the Gnaw or that they didn't worship the Gnaw at all is unclear. If the latter is the case, then this quote contradicts the Gnaw Worshipper Portrait Frame description which states that they started worshipping the Gnaw to earn its favor.

# Slurtle

![Slurtle](Slurtle.png)

The **Slurtle** is a neutral **Mob** that spawns from **Slurtle Mounds** found in **Caves**. They are small and slow, but they have high **Health** and can retreat into their shells after a number of hits, which gain 95% **Damage Reduction**, making them very difficult to kill.

- **Health:** 1200
- **Diet:** [Elementals](Food_Type#Elementals)
- **Damage:** 25
- **Attack Period:** 4
- **Attack Range:** 2.5
- **Walk Speed:** 3

**Drops:**
- **Slurtle Slime** x2
- **Broken Shell**
- **Shelmet** (10% chance)

**Spawn Code:** "slurtle"

**Spawn From:** ![Slurtle Mound](Slurtle Mound.png) (90%)

**Special Ability:** Eats **Minerals** and can hide in its shell.

**Quotes:**
- Wilson: "Ew. Just ew."
- Willow: "I want to blow it up!"
- Wolfgang: "Ha! You are slow!"
- Wendy: "It is mindlessly chasing after rocks."
- WX-78: "HE HAS A SHELL LIKE ME"
- Wickerbottom: "A mineral-devouring gastropod."
- Woodie: "He's just misunderstood."
- Maxwell: "I don't remember those..."
- Wagstaff: "Has a frustrating trait of not wanting to be dissected."
- Wigfrid: "You are an angel. Of nasty."
- Webber: "We'll slaughter that slurtle."
- Walani: "It tastes with its feet. Gross."
- Warly: "You would flavor a soup nicely. Your shell could be the bowl!"
- Woodlegs: "Look at ye slurtle'n around."
- Wilba: "TIS POINTY-SHELLED SLIME BEASTIES"
- Wormwood: "Shy Spiky Shell"
- Wheeler: "A little advice: You might go faster if you ditched that heavy shell."
- Winona: "Just don't seem right."
- Wortox: "Slinky, slurp and slime."
- Wurt: "Look like a friend, flort."
- Walter: "What is that slimy thing? I've gotta get a closer look!"
- Wanda: "How do they stand being so slow?"

## Snurtle

![Snurtle](Snurtle.png)

The **Snurtle** is an alternate version of a Slurtle with a different kind of shell, which also gains 95% **Damage Reduction**. It actively flees from the player and will retreat into its shell instead of attacking back.

- **Health:** 200
- **Diet:** [Elementals](Food_Type#Elementals)
- **Walk Speed:** 4

**Drops:**
- **Slurtle Slime** x2
- **Broken Shell**
- **Snurtle Shell Armor** (75% chance)

**Spawn Code:** "snurtle"

**Spawn From:** ![Slurtle Mound](Slurtle Mound.png) (10%)

**Special Ability:** Eats **Minerals** and can hide in its shell.

**Quotes:**
- Wilson: "He's less gross, but still gross."
- Willow: "Kaboom!"
- Wolfgang: "Spirally!"
- Wendy: "That one has a larger shell."
- WX-78: "DIFFERENT SHELL, SAME SLUG"
- Wickerbottom: "A rare variant of gastropod."
- Woodie: "Spiral!"

## Hunting Tips

Players can kite Slurtles: strike one a few times, then run in the opposite direction before it can snap. Try not to fight more than three at once, since they're slow and group easily.

For Snurtles, one of the easiest ways to kill them is to simply attack them each time they poke their head out of their shell until their health is worn down.

## Trivia

- The name "Slurtle" is a portmanteau of "slug" and "turtle," while "Snurtle" is a portmanteau of "snail" and "turtle."
- Maxwell doesn't remember creating either the Snurtle or Slurtles, and Wickerbottom has never encountered them in her home world, meaning that the creature's origins are a mystery.

# Rabbit

## Overview
A **Rabbit** is a passive **Mob** commonly found in **Grassland**, **Forest**, and **Savanna** biomes. They drop **Morsel** when killed. Rabbits are cowardly creatures and will run away screaming if the player gets too close. They will also run straight to their **Rabbit Holes** at dusk or if they witness the death of a nearby Rabbit. Digging up a Rabbit Hole with a **Shovel** will evict any Rabbit inside and prevent them from hiding again, but Rabbit Holes will not respawn and thus can't produce more Rabbits.

## Attributes
- **Naughtiness**: 1
- **Diet**: Veggie
- **Health**: 25
- **Drops**: Morsel, Rabbit, Winter Rabbit (Trap)
- **Special Ability**: Eats dropped Fruits and Vegetables, Becomes Beardling when sanity < 40%
- **Run Speed**: 5
- **Dropped By**: Tumbleweed (0.1% x 3), Prestihatitator
- **Spawn From**: Rabbit Hole
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Tool**: Can be Trapped (Only Common Trap)
- **Spoil**: 5 days
- **Spawn Code**: "rabbit"

## Gallery
![Rabbit](Rabbit.png)  
![Winter Rabbit](Winter_Rabbit.png)

## Quotes
- Wilson: He's looking for carrots.
- Willow: He looks tasty.
- Wolfgang: Tiny rabbit! Hide from me!
- Wendy: He is wandering mindlessly, oblivious to his fate.
- WX-78: IT IS PERFORMING A SEARCH ALGORITHM
- Wickerbottom: It's some kind of Lagormorph. With horns.

## Beardling
A Rabbit will turn into a Beardling when a character's Sanity drops below 40%. All Rabbits, including those in inventory or containers, will become Beardlings.

### Attributes
- **Naughtiness**: 1
- **Health**: 25
- **Diet**: Veggie
- **Sanity Aura**: -40
- **Drops**: Monster Meat 40%, Nightmare Fuel 40%, Beard Hair 20%
- **Special Ability**: Eats Fruits and Vegetables, Turns into a Rabbit when sanity is above 40%
- **Run Speed**: 5
- **Dropped By**: Tumbleweed (0.1% x 3), Prestihatitator
- **Spawn From**: Rabbit Hole
- **Spawn Code**: "rabbit"
- **Tool**: Can be Trapped (Only Common Trap)
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spoil**: 5 days

## Hunting
To catch a Rabbit, place a **Trap** directly above a Rabbit Hole. This will guarantee the capture of a Rabbit and can be done with large amounts of Rabbit Holes, which can provide the player with a steady supply of food. The best place to farm Rabbits is in the **Savanna**, where Rabbit Holes are very abundant.

## Usage
- **Rabbit**: Morsel (Hand), Cooked Morsel (Fire)
- **Rabbit**: Rabbit Earmuffs (Science Machine)
- **Rabbit**: Prestihatitator (Science Machine)
- **Rabbit**: War Saddle (Alchemy Engine)
- **Rabbit**: Warren Wreath (Benevolent Rabbit King)
- **Rabbit**: Acceleration Circuit (Bio Scanalyzer, WX-78)
- **Beardling**: Monster Meat, Nightmare Fuel, Beard Hair (Hand)

## The Gorge
In **The Gorge** event, Rabbits can be caught with a Trap purchased from **Billy** for four Old Coins. Murdering them produces **Meat Scraps**, which can be used in the various Cooking Recipes.

### Recipes
- **Rabbit**: Meat Scraps (Hand)
- **Rabbit**: Cooked Meat Scraps (Fire)

## Trivia
- Rabbits are one of three passive mobs that drop Monster Meat, with the others being Glommer and the Dung Beetle.
- Wickerbottom identifies Rabbits as lagomorphs, the taxonomic order which real-world rabbits belong to.

## Bugs
- Rabbits and Beardlings will sometimes co-exist for a very brief moment when the player becomes (in)sane enough for them to change.

## Pig Houses Details
Pig Houses are natural and craftable [[structures]] where [[Pig]]s spawn and live. A Pig is spawned once a Pig House is constructed and respawns after 4 [[day]]s if killed. Pig Houses are naturally occurring in [[Pig Village]]s, with the possibility of the village containing the [[Pig King]]. Occasionally, an individual Pig House can be found in the wilderness.

A Pig House requires 4 [[Boards]], 3 [[Cut Stone]]s, and 4 [[Pig Skin]]s to craft and an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype.

At [[Dusk]] and [[Night]], Pig Houses with Pigs in them will have a [[Charlie (Night Monster)#Light Sources|light]] on. However, as soon as the player approaches the house, the light is switched off. The Pig will relight the light only when the player moves away.

Pig Houses can catch on [[fire]]. If the resident Pig is inside the House they will immediately come out to avoid the fire. If the Pig is dead instead, a new one will spawn inside the House and leave, making it possible to bypass the 4 days respawn time.

## Skins
The '''<span style="color:#BD4646;">Woven - Elegant</span> Thatched Cottage''' skin was introduced during the official [[Year of the Carrat]] event in 2020.

## Tips
- Since resources required to build a Pig House are quite demanding, a good idea is to find and hammer down naturally generated houses found on the map and rebuild them in a preferred place. Each hammered down house gives back half of the resources required to build a new one (2 [[Cut Stone]], 2 [[Boards]] and 2 [[Pig Skin|Pig Skins]]).
- It's not recommended to build Pig Houses too close to one's base since they eat [[Food]] items on the ground. Eating [[Monster Foods]] accidentally left on the ground could turn them into a [[Werepig]].
- Building one or two Pig Houses next

# Night Hand

![Hand](Hand in loop 90s 000.png) ![Arm](Arm loop 90s 000.png)

- **Walk Speed:** 2
- **Sanity Aura:** -40 (hand)
- **Spawn Code:** "shadowhand", "shadowhand_arm"

The **Night Hand** is a Shadow Creature that emerges from the darkness to attempt to extinguish the player's fire, accompanied by eerie music box sounds. Up to 3 Night Hands can spawn simultaneously.

## Properties

- A Night Hand reduces the strength of a fire by 50%.
- Multiple hands decrease the damage to a fire incrementally (1 Hand = <60% per hand, 3 Hands = <30% per hand).
- Night Hands have a **Sanity** aura of -40/min.
- Stepping on a Night Hand causes it to retract into the darkness temporarily before reappearing.
- Chasing a Night Hand into complete darkness can cause it to permanently disappear.

## Tactics

- Maximizing fire strength and standing near to re-maximize it after an attack, though resource-intensive, can mitigate Night Hand effects.
- A second fire or a **Miner Hat** can negate Night Hands for the night.
- Placing **Fireflies** around the fire can prevent Night Hands from appearing.

## Combat

- Forcing a Night Hand to retract until its wrist touches its end can "kill" it.
- A bright light source can destroy a Night Hand.

## In "Don't Starve Together"

- 1 or 2 Night Hands appear when players' sanity is below 75%.
- The number of Night Hands is random and independent of sanity.
- There is a random delay of 2 to 6 minutes between appearances.
- Players with less than 4 days on a server will not encounter Night Hands.

## Trivia

- **In-Game:**
  - Lightning strikes can extinguish Night Hands upon spawning.
  - **Ghost Characters** in DST can chase away Night Hands to assist living players.
  - Smoke from the **Shadow Thurible** and Tragic **Torch** skin sometimes resembles Shadow Creatures.
- **Lore:**
  - Shadow Creatures appear in **William Carter Puzzles**.
  - Instances of Shadow Hands and Terrorbeaks terrorize **Wanda** in the animated short "Long Shadows".

## Bugs

- The music associated with a Night Hand may continue indefinitely, resolvable by reloading the game.
- A Night Hand can extinguish a fire even after retreating.
- A Night Hand may appear with Sanity more than half full.
- A Night Hand may appear in the Ocean.
- A Night Hand may remain in place until chased or destroyed by light when a player returns to their camp.

- **WX-78**: ITS METABOLISM OFFENDS ME

- **Winona**: You really oughta get some sun.
- **Wortox**: You hop just like me!
- **Wurt**: Don't like Bunnyman!
- **Walter**: I've never heard of the Bunnyman before! Better make a note.
- **Wanda**: I don't trust those things.

## Interactions
Bunnymen, like pigs, will attack any monster on sight, such as spiders and batilisks. These attacks include Webber and Wortox. When killed, they will drop 2 Carrots and 1 Meat (75%) or 1 Bunny Puff (25%). Bunnymen will respawn from their Rabbit Hutches after 1 day.

Bunnymen can be befriended by giving them a Carrot (cooked or raw) and will follow the player, the same way pigs do, for up to 20 minutes or 2.5 game days. For example, feeding 1 Carrot to a Bunnyman will make it a follower for 4 minutes (half a game day). When befriended, Bunnymen will have a Sanity aura of 25/min.

Bunnymen will attack the player if any Meats or Eggs are in the player's inventory, including Crock Pot foods unless they are wrapped with bundling wrap. They can sense Meat food items on the player from a range of 8 away. Bunnymen detect monsters inside a radius of 16 'walls', or 4 tiles. A 14 layer thick wall is enough for a Bunnyman to not detect a distant monster.

Bunnymen are attracted by veggies on the floor and will attempt to consume them within a radius of 10. Some examples of veggies are Carrot, Powdercake, Birchnut, and Glow Berry.

Even befriended Bunnymen can become hostile if the player picks up meat. However, Bunnymen won't attack Chester (Hutch or Woby in DST) if he is carrying Meat food items, nor will they attack the player for carrying a Ham Bat.

Bunnymen regenerate 8.67 Health every 5 seconds.

Bunnymen will flee when they have less than 67 Health. Unlike Pigs, they do not fight using a kiting style. Bunnymen will defend each other when attacked. Bunnymen also help fellow Bunnymen in attacking; if the player attacks a Bunnyman while allied with other Bunnymen, the player's allies and all neutral Bunnymen (that is not the one being targeted) will help to kill the one targeted by the player. If a befriended player is being attacked nearby, sleeping Bunnymen will wake up to defend their ally. Oddly, they will do the same if a nearby Pig is attacked. If a Bunnyman is pursuing the player and is unable to catch up after

## Description
Chester, short for Otto von Chesterfield, Esquire, is a unique passive mob that acts as a mobile Chest. By clicking on Chester, the player can store up to nine stacks of items inside him. He will first spawn after the Eye Bone is placed in the player's inventory and will follow the Eye Bone from that point on.

## Shadow Chester
Chester can transform under the magic of a Full Moon when filled with specific magic items in his 9 inventory slots. Filling all of Chester's inventory slots with at least one unit of Nightmare Fuel will create Shadow Chester. Shadow Chester gains 3 more inventory slots, bringing his total inventory space to 12, and causes food inside him to spoil 50% faster.

## Snow Chester
Filling Chester instead with one Blue Gem at each slot will turn him into Snow Chester at Full Moon. Snow Chester's ability causes food to last twice as long inside him, effectively turning Chester into a fuzzy and portable Ice Box.

## Tips
- Eye Bone's location usually is close to the spawn and next to a road.
- Chester regenerates health at a fast rate, he can be a useful tool in restoring the player's health.
- It may be a good idea to keep the Eye Bone in a Backpack so that when armor is equipped, Chester will remain near the Backpack while enemies are dealt with.

## Trivia
- Chester was added in the Spoiled Rotten update.
- Chester's name is a pun on him being a mobile chest.
- Chester is one of the few Mobs that cannot be frozen.

# Platapine
The **Platapine** is a neutral **Mob** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC which spawns in the **Lily Pond** Biome. Similar to how **Gobbler**s spawn from **Berry Bush**es, they will spawn when a **Lotus Plant** is picked, and will proceed to consume the **Lotus Flower**s of all nearby Lotus Plants if not stopped. They defend themselves with a spinning dash that allows them to flee or inflict damage on enemies. They are stunlockable and will help each other.

## Trivia
- The name of the creature is a portmanteau of 'platypus' and 'porcupine'.
- The fast speed and spinning attack in a blue porcupine-like creature are all likely references to **Sonic the Hedgehog**, a popular Sega platforming game.

## Usage

**Hunting:** Redbirds can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one. They can be Murdered by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Crimson Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel. Birds in the player's inventory can be dropped on the ground and will flop on the ground belly-up for a short while before flying off. They can also be imprisoned in Bird Cages.

**Hunting with Spear:** Redbirds can be hunted using a ranged weapon such as a Boomerang. Birds will not land within melee range (even if bait is placed on the ground) and will fly away when the player approaches. However, if they are put to sleep when using characters with a normal damage modifier, they can be killed in 1 hit with a sufficient melee weapon.

**Resources:** Redbirds can drop a variety of basic resources instead of seeds to help new players when they fly away. If the world is younger than 3 days, seeds will drop instead of other items. These common items are randomly chosen, and a given item won't drop if there is already a type of the same item within a radius of 2 tiles. Items will also not drop if 2 of same type of items are within a radius of 5 tiles. The item depends on the age of the oldest player within a 5 tiles radius.

## Tips

- When bait-trapping Birds for their Feathers, players should make sure to do so on Turf in which specific Birds will spawn, so that they get specific Feathers. Redbirds and Snowbirds spawn most commonly on Grass Turf, while Crows spawn on Rocky Turf and all player-made turfs.
- If one can manage to bring a Damaged Bishop from the Ruins, their ranged blasts are an effective tool to hunt birds without expending resources on Bird Traps or Boomerangs.
- If the player doesn't want any Feathers from the Birds, cooking them alive provides a guaranteed Cooked Morsel. Note that this means sacrificing the option of turning the Bird into Small Jerky, since cooked meat cannot be hung on a Drying Rack.
- If the player character has a damage modifier < 1, Boomerangs will not kill birds with one hit, allowing them to flee. Alternatively, the player can use an Ice Staff to freeze the bird then use melee to kill them.
- If placed in a Hamlet interior, birds will flop around on the floor, upside
