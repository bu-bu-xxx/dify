## Behavior

Vipers are hostile Mobs exclusive to the Hamlet DLC. They can be found in the Ancient Pig Ruins, under Stone Slabs, and when cutting down a Rainforest Tree. Similar to Snakes from the Shipwrecked DLC, Vipers are nocturnal creatures and unless they are provoked by chopping down a Rainforest Tree or flipping the stone slabs, they will not be active until Dusk and through Night. If any Vipers are attacked, all other Vipers in the vicinity will join in the battle to attack their aggressor. If the player runs far enough away, the Vipers will give up and fall asleep until another creature or the player walks near. Vipers will actively pick fights with all other creatures (except their own kind), hostile or not. Vipers will try to eat Meats and Eggs that are left on the ground.

## Fighting Strategy

- Vipers take 1 blast to be frozen with an Ice Staff and takes 1 Sleep Dart to be put to sleep.
- Vipers may be kited by dodging their attack and then attacking them 3 times which kills them before they can hit the player, as long as a weapon at least as strong as a Spear is used.
- Vipers can be hit once before they attack and still miss their target. This is very useful for dealing with groups of Vipers.

## Trivia

According to Wickerbottom, vipers resemble a breed of Agkistrodon, which is a genus of the Viperidae family. Despite all members of this family are venomous, vipers seem to be non-poisonous in the game. Vipers have the ability to swim and have a forked tail. However, no snakes with a forked tail exist in real life.

- **Wanda**: Some kind of yellow bird.

## Resources
In Don't Starve Together, birds can drop a variety of basic resources instead of seeds to help new players when they fly away. If the world is younger than 3 days, seeds will drop instead of other items.

| Player age | Birds Item |
|------------|-----------|
| < 1 day    | Seeds (13%), Flint (3.5%), Twigs (2.3%), Cut Grass (1.2%) |
| 1 day      | Seeds (15%), Flint (2.5%), Twigs (1.7%), Cut Grass (0.8%) |
| 2 days     | Seeds (17%), Flint (1.5%), Twigs (1%), Cut Grass (0.5%) |
| ≤ 20 days* | Seeds (20%) |
| ≤ 1 year   | Seeds (16%) |
| > 1 year   | Seeds (12%) |

*The actual value is the duration of Autumn, which is 20 days in the default settings.

## Hunting
Birds can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one.

## Volatile
When placed in a Bird Cage in Caves while the Toadstool is alive, the Canary gets poisoned after 6-12 minutes, giving a Volatile Canary.

## Usage
- **Canary**: Morsel or Saffron Feather
- **Canary (Volatile)**: Rot, Napsack (crafted with Shroom Skin)

## Tips
- When bait-trapping Birds for their Feathers, players should make sure to do so on Turf in which specific Birds will spawn, so that they get specific Feathers.
- If one can manage to bring a Damaged Bishop from the Ruins, their ranged blasts are an effective tool to hunt birds without expending resources on Bird Trap

The **Seal** is a passive mob and poses no threat to the player. Killing the seal form will drop 4 Meats and a Magic Seal, and adds 50 points of naughtiness which immediately spawns Krampus.

If the player refuses to kill the Sealnado in its seal form, it will disappear once the player leaves the approximate vicinity of the seal. When it disappears, it will leave behind a Magic Seal. This choice allows obtaining the Magic Seal without having to face Krampus; however, the Meat reward will be unobtainable.

### Behavior
The Sealnado generally has two patterns: punch and twister. Initially, the Sealnado twister AoE attack can be done as one of the first couple attacks during encounter. Sealnado will throw about 3-6 Sealnado punches between each twister attack.

### Strategy
It is not recommended to fight the Sealnado near a base if the player has Walls and Sandbags, as certain attacks will quickly decimate them. The fight is considerably easier on land, so it's recommended to fight this way.

# Snurtle Shell Armor

## Overview
- **Type**: Armor
- **Rarity**: Common
- **Durability**: 1050 HP
- **Damage Absorption**: 60% when worn normally, 100% when hiding inside
- **Dropped by**: Snurtle (75%), Ancient Pseudoscience Station (with Hammer)
- **Exclusive to**: Don't Starve, Reign of Giants, Shipwrecked, Hamlet, Don't Starve Together

## Description
The Snurtle Shell Armor is a wearable piece of armor that can be dropped by Snurtles. It has 1050 durability and absorbs 60% of physical damage when worn normally. When the player hides inside the shell (by right-clicking on it in the inventory), it absorbs 100% of physical damage. Hiding inside the shell also absorbs freezing from Deerclops and Blue Hounds, electric shock from Volt Goats, and knocking items out of the inventory from Frogs. Not considering its durability, the snurtle shell armor effectively adds 225 HP to the average survivor.

## Usage
The Snurtle Shell Armor works like a Bush Hat in that aggressive mobs will not attack the player if they hide before they aggro on them. Additionally, after hiding inside the shell for around 5 seconds, all attackers will lose interest in the player and stop their attacks. This means that the shell can be used to avoid Hound attacks and Shadow Creatures.

## Trivia
- Unlike other armors which can't block more damage than they have durability left, Snurtle Shell Armor completely negates damage from hits strong enough to destroy it.
- Willow, Wendy, Wigfrid, and Wilba will have their hair clip through the armor, while Webber has spider legs clip through it. This is only a visual issue and doesn't affect gameplay.
- If the player is attacked by Charlie while hiding inside the Shell, they will receive no Health damage but the hurt animation will play, making the player come out of hiding and still take the Sanity damage.

# Winter in Don't Starve

Winter is one of the two seasons affecting the surface in *Don't Starve* (the other being Summer). It is also one of the four seasons in the *Reign of Giants* DLC, alongside Summer, Spring, and Autumn. By default, Winter lasts for 16 days in Sandbox Mode; starting on day 21 and lasting until day 36. This duration can be altered in the Preferences. Many aspects of the game world change with the onset of Winter, making survival more challenging.

## Freezing

The most significant change in Winter is the drop in temperature, which can lead to freezing if the player's character gets too cold. To prevent this, characters must maintain their body temperature by staying close to heat sources. Carrying a heated Thermal Stone is crucial, and having the means to make Fire during emergencies is essential. Wearing warm clothing extends the time a character can be away from fire before getting too cold. Wilson and Webber's beards act similarly to warm clothing, increasing in efficiency as they grow longer.

## Seasonal Changes

- The environment takes on a bluish tint at the start of Winter.
- Redbirds are replaced by Snowbirds.
- Rabbits change into a white winter coat, providing a stable food source.
- Hounds attacking during Winter are replaced by Blue Hounds, which freeze nearby mobs upon death.
- Koalefant hunts yield Winter Koalefants, whose trunks can be used to make warm Puffy Vests.
- New aggressive creatures appear, such as a Walrus hunting party led by MacTusk and Deerclops.
- Pengulls emerge from the ocean in large flocks, laying Eggs that can be collected upon their death.
- Many creatures become inactive, including Bees, Butterflies, and Batilisks.
- Snow accumulates on trees and objects, affecting visibility and body temperature.
- Farms cannot grow crops, but unharvested crops remain fresh.
- Berry Bushes, Saplings, and other plants regrow slowly or not at all.
- Nights and Dusks are longer, impacting Sanity negatively.
- Perishable items spoil slower, and Ice does not melt.
- Snow causes a slight decrease in body temperature but does not damage WX-78.

## Reign of Giants

In the *Reign of Giants* DLC, Mini Glaciers form during Winter, and freezing is possible in Caves and Ruins. Night and Dusk are even longer, affecting Sanity more for those unprepared. New insulating items, like the Hibearnation Vest, are added to help fend off the cold. Birchnut Trees lose their leaves and Birchnuts during Winter.

## Don't Starve Together

In *Don't Starve Together*, the Loot Stash spawns in the Deciduous Forest or Mosaic biome, and No-Eyed Deer grow Deer Antlers that can be dropped upon colliding with solid objects.

## Tips

- Bee Boxes can be harvested without retaliation during Winter, providing a valuable food source.
- Pengulls can be used to deal with Hound waves by hiding with a Bush Hat and letting them fight.
- Warm clothing does not increase body temperature but slows its decrease.
- Torches or Willow’s Lighter can be used to set flammable objects on fire for warmth.
- A special Chest containing winter-related items may spawn in a Forest biome, but opening it triggers Winter.
- Woodie cannot freeze in his Werebeaver form.
- It is recommended to make a Thermal Stone before Winter to prevent freezing.
- Players with increased hunger drain will find the Hibearnation Vest helpful due to its hunger and freezing delay effects.

- **Walter:** "I should find a good spot to plant this."

## Description
Pine Cones can be planted to grow into Evergreen trees. It takes from 7.5 to 10 game hours for them to grow from saplings into small trees. They can also be used as a low-level fuel item. Planted saplings will not appear on the map until they have progressed into the small tree stage. Pine Cones can't be planted on Checkerboard Floorings, Wooden Floorings, Cobblestones, Carpeted Floorings, Rocky Turfs, and Cave Rock Turfs, unless it has been planted before these turfs were placed. When chopping down trees, it should be noted that chopping down a Large Evergreen will provide two Pine Cones, a Medium Evergreen will provide one, and a Small Evergreen will provide none. Planting Pine Cones can calm and put to sleep nearby Treeguards, whether or not they are aggressive. The chance of this happening is a maximum of 33% when planted near the Treeguard, with a lower chance when planted farther away. The Treeguard will groan in acknowledgement when a Pine Cone is planted within range, even if it has already been pacified.

## Downloadable Content
In the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, Pine Cones can be bought for 1 Oinc at Miss Sow's Floral Arrangements in the Pig City. As they are cheap, they are recommended for planting a pine tree farm as soon as possible, as Rainforest Trees only drop seeds during Lush Season, and Tea Trees drop less logs.

## Trivia
- In older versions of the game, when the player planted a cone, the plant first sprouted as a small tree, rather than a new sapling.

## Usage
To craft one chunk of Thulecite, combine 6 Thulecite Fragments using a Broken Pseudoscience Station.

## Tips
- If you need to turn Thulecite into fragments, craft walls and hammer them. 1 Thulecite becomes 6 walls which yield 1 fragment each, making this process completely reversible at the minor cost of hammer durability.

## Trivia
- Thulecite Fragments were added in "A Moderately Friendly Update".

## Mobs that Drop Thulecite Fragments
- Damaged Knight
- Damaged Rook
- Damaged Bishop (50% chance)

## Resources
- Non-Renewable
- Minerals
- Non-Flammable
- Naturally Spawning Objects

## Description
Figatoni is a Vegetable Food item exclusive to Don't Starve Together and introduced in the Waterlogged update. It is made by combining a fig with 2.0 points of vegetables. The recipe is lenient with inedible fillers and high in priority, only excluding meat items. Adding any meat item will usually result in Meatballs or can rarely turn into Fish Tacos, Fig-Stuffed Trunk, Froggle Bunwich, Stuffed Eggplant, or Stuffed Pepper Poppers depending on the combination of Meats and Vegetables used.

It has a notably high hunger value for a vegetarian dish, being the third most filling one, only passed by Dragonpie and Milkmade Hat. It also provides above-average healing and decent sanity, making it a rather balanced dish. Figs needed to cook it can be found ready to pick in the Waterlogged biome on sea, or be homegrown using Knobbly Tree Nuts and Tree Jams. It is possible to make the dish with ingredients purely found at sea, combining figs and Ocean Fishes such as Popperfish/Corn Cod.

As a vegetarian dish, it cannot be eaten by Wigfrid, but all other survivors will enjoy it, with Wurt gaining an extra 33% hunger benefit from it, gaining 75 Hunger.

## Trivia
- Following Barnacle Linguine, this is the second pasta-based crock pot dish in the main game. Given that both dishes require 2.0 vegetable value, it's reasonable to assume that the starch of two vegetable crops are used in deriving the starch for making the Wheat Dough.
- Warly's examination quote could either be positive or negative, as decadent in

# Clockwork Bishop

![Clockwork Bishop](Clockwork Bishop.png)

The **Clockwork Bishop** is an aggressive [Mob] usually seen in a [Chess] [Biome] guarding the [Wooden Thing] in [Sandbox Mode] and other places in [Adventure Mode]. It also spawns from a mined [Maxwell Statue] in the chapter [Epilogue] of Adventure Mode. It is a part of Maxwell's [Chess Monsters|Chess Pieces].

## Behavior

The Bishop usually stands close to the [Wooden Thing], guarding it from any intruders. When any creature gets near its sight range, the Bishop will suddenly wake up and stare at them as a warning. Getting closer will make the Bishop attack by firing lightning bolts from its head. The Bishop will chase its enemy a short distance from its spawn area before returning and going back to sleep.

## Hunting

The Bishop is overall the most difficult of the Chess Pieces, it is a strong ranged mob, and very accurate, making it almost impossible to kite effectively so it is recommended to be armored and armed for a battle with one. Sending some [Pigs] to attack it first may prove to be an effective distraction. The player may try and use a [Boomerang] to kill it from far away, but this will grab the Bishop's attention, and it will start attacking. The player may also use an [Ice Staff] to freeze it, and then, start hitting it with a Spear, but it will cause some damage to the player. Another way to kill a Bishop would be to aggravate a nearby [Clockwork Rook] without waking the Bishop and get the Rook to ram the Bishop, as this will most likely kill the Bishop instantly (This strategy also works with [Clockwork Knights] and other [mobs]).

It is possible to dodge the Bishop's lighting bolts if the player is quick enough. Suddenly running to one side just as the Bishop is about to attack will usually leave the player unharmed by the lighting bolt, although the bolt does have a small area effect.

Another tactic to kill the Bishop is to lead all other mobs away, then use a [Log Suit] and [Spear] and hold down the attack button until it is dead, although this will cost the player a good amount of health, so it is only recommended to use this method when there is a decent amount of healing items in the player's immediate possession.

When a Bishop is located near a Spider Den, it is advised to lead some Spiders close enough to the Bishop without aggrevating it, as Bishops attack all monsters except other chess pieces when coming too close. Bishops also naturally attack Pigs, Bunnymen, Chester and similiar.

| Thulecite Club & Fire Dart | 2           |
| Tooth Trap & Dark Sword  | 1             |

## Tips

- Clockwork Bishops (as well as knights and rooks) can be lit on fire with a [torch]. If on fire, bishops and knights jump around until the flame extinguishes without attacking. While you will take fire damage from being close to them, you may take less damage than you would from tanking the bishop. [Wormwood] may be the worst at this strategy since he catches on fire easier and takes more damage from fire. [Willow] takes no damage from fire.
- [Wheeler] can avoid taking damage from clockwork bishops by timing her Dodge ability correctly, since her Dodge has I-frames.

## Trivia

- The Clockwork Bishop was originally added in the [Don't Starve/Version History#Doorway to Adventure|Doorway to Adventure] update.
- According to quotes, the bishop is Maxwell's favorite clockwork.

# Trap

## Description
The **Trap** is a **Survival** item used to catch small animals such as **Rabbits**, **Frogs**, and **Spiders**. It can be crafted at the beginning of the game with 6 **Cut Grass** and 2 **Twigs**.

## Usage
![Trap](WilsonTrap.jpg "Trap")

### Crafting
- **Ingredient 1:** Cut Grass (multiplier 1: 6)
- **Ingredient 2:** Twigs (multiplier 2: 2)

### Specifications
- **Filter:** {{Pic32|Tools Filter}} {{Pic32|Food & Gardening Filter}}
- **Tier:** 0

- **Wurt:** "Sneaky!"
- **Walter:** "We learned how to make them in the Pinetree Pioneers."
- **Wanda:** "The trap is fine, it's the part afterwards that makes me sad..."

## Hunting
Traps can be baited with food items attractive to said animals. Baited or not, a Trap will trigger once a small mob moves close enough to it. Traps do not need bait in order to catch creatures; if a creature touches the Trap for any reason, it will fall and possibly catch it.

## The Gorge
In **The Gorge** event for **Don't Starve Together**, Traps function almost identically to the way they do in normal gameplay, other than the fact that they have no durability and can be used an infinite amount of times. They are used to catch **Rabbits**. Traps can be purchased from **Billy** for 4 Old Coins each.

## Skins
* The **Woven - Elegant Basket Trap** skin was introduced during the official Year of the Carrat event in 2020.

## Tips
- Creatures that cannot be caught in the Trap can still eat food used as a bait in the Trap.
- Traps can be used to kill Spiders and Frogs without aggroing any others in close proximity.

## Bugs
- Traps found near Skeletons as part of Set Pieces have a random amount of durability. Sometimes, a Trap may be at 0%; they can be used to trap animals infinitely and will never break.

# Slurtle

![Slurtle](Slurtle.png)

The Slurtle is a neutral Mob that spawns from Slurtle Mounds found in Caves. They are small and slow, but they have high Health and can retreat into their shells after a number of hits, which gain 95% Damage Reduction, so they are very difficult to kill. When killed, they drop two Slurtle Slime and Broken Shell or Shelmet. Every once in a while they will drop slime while still alive, similar to how Beefalo drop Manure.

**Attributes:**
- Health: 600
- Diet: Elementals ![Elemental](Elemental.png)
- Damage: 25
- Attack Period: 4
- Attack Range: 2.5
- Walk Speed: 3
- Drops: Slurtle Slime ×2, Broken Shell, Shelmet (10%)
- Spawn Code: "slurtle"
- Spawn From: Slurtle Mound (90%)
- Special Ability: Eats Minerals. Can hide in its shell.

**Quotes:**
- Wilson: "Ew. Just ew."
- Willow: "I want to blow it up!"
- Wolfgang: "Ha! You are slow!"
- Wendy: "It is mindlessly chasing after rocks."
- WX-78: "HE HAS A SHELL LIKE ME"
- Wickerbottom: "A mineral-devouring gastropod."
- Woodie: "He's just misunderstood."

# Snurtle

![Snurtle](Snurtle.png)

A Snurtle is an alternate version of a Slurtle with a different kind of shell, which gain 95% Damage Reduction. It actively flees from the player and will retreat into its shell instead of attacking back. Upon death, Snurtles drop two Slurtle Slime and sometimes a Snurtle Shell Armor or a Broken Shell. They spawn rarely from Slurtle Mounds.

**Attributes:**
- Health: 200
- Diet: Elementals ![Elemental](Elemental.png)
- Walk Speed: 4
- Drops: Slurtle Slime ×2, Broken Shell, Snurtle Shell Armor (75%)
- Spawn Code: "snurtle"
- Spawn From: Slurtle Mound (10%)
- Special Ability: Eats Minerals. Can hide in its shell.

**Quotes:**
- Wilson: "He's less gross, but still gross."
- Willow: "Kaboom!"
- Wolfgang: "Spirally!"
- Wickerbottom: "A rare variant of gastropod."

## Hunting Tips

Players can kite Slurtles: strike one a few times, then run in the opposite direction before it can snap. Try not to fight more than three at once, since they're slow and group easily. When fighting a single Slurtle, it's possible to hit it 2-3 times before it has a chance to strike.

Snurtles are rarer than Slurtles but have a large chance to drop Snurtle Shell Armor. Due to their hiding ability and moderately large health, they take some time to kill. For this reason, it is a good idea to fight them when no other creatures (which might join the battle) are nearby.

## Trivia

- The name "Slurtle" is a portmanteau of "slug" and "turtle," while "Snurtle" is a portmanteau of "snail" and "turtle."
- Maxwell doesn't remember creating either the Snurtle or Slurtles, and Wickerbottom has never encountered them in her home world, meaning that the creature's origins are a mystery.

# Stinger

## Overview

The **Stinger** is commonly dropped by **Bees** or **Killer Bees** when killed. It is an ingredient in **Sleep Darts**.

## Obtaining Stingers

Stingers can be obtained by:
- Killing Bees or Killer Bees with **Weapons**.
- Relying on other **Mobs** to help kill Bees or Killer Bees.
- Catching Bees or Killer Bees with a **Bug Net** then murdering them in the inventory.

Keep in mind that attacking a Bee (including catching them with the Bug Net) will cause remaining members of the same **Bee Hive** (or **Bee Box**) to emerge as Killer Bees, and all members of the hive in the vicinity will target the attacker.

## Usage

- **Stingers** can easily become clutter in vanilla **Don't Starve** and **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants**, especially given their limited use in crafting **Sleep Darts**.
- They can also be set on fire to turn them into **Ashes**.

## Downloadable Content (DLC)

- **Reign of Giants**: Stingers have a chance to be obtained by harvesting **Tumbleweeds**.
- **Shipwrecked**: Stingers can be used to craft **Boat Repair Kits**.

Meatballs is a Meat food item cooked in the Crock Pot by combining any Meats and fillers excluding Inedibles. However, adding 3.0 units of Meats will result in Meaty Stew instead. It takes 15 seconds to cook.

Adding 2 or more Monster Foods will result in Monster Lasagna, unless Twigs are also added, which will then result in Wet Goop. Adding Honey will result in Honey Nuggets or Honey Ham. Adding a Mandrake will result in Mandrake Soup. Adding Eggplant and another Vegetable will result in Stuffed Eggplant. Using less than 1.0 units of Meats and using at least two Ice as fillers will result in Bunny Stew.

Meatballs are a decent starter recipe for Hunger, especially when only working with monster meat. There are better alternatives, such as Meaty Stew, Honey Ham, Bacon and Eggs, that provide more Health and Hunger gain, or longer spoilage time. Attention should be paid to the ingredients used as depending on the recipe, meatballs may provide little to no hunger over their components (e.g. 1 Meat and 3 Carrots will provide no additional hunger).

# Glommer

**Glommer** is a passive [Mob] from the [[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]] DLC.

## Description

Glommer is found during every [[Full Moon]] at [[Glommer's Statue]], along with a [[Glommer's Flower]]. When the Glommer's Flower is picked up, Glommer will follow the player, similar to [[Chester]] and his [[Eye Bone]]. If Glommer's Flower is dropped on the ground or put inside a stationary container, Glommer will remain in the area near the flower. If Glommer's Flower is placed inside Chester, Glommer will follow Chester as well. When day-time comes and if the flower is still attached to Glommer's Statue, Glommer will fly away up into the air (similar to a [[Mosling]]).

When tamed, Glommer provides a [[Sanity]] aura of +6.25/min (only while standing extremely close, similar to befriended [[Pig]]s), making it useful in countering the nighttime sanity drain of -5/min. It will also drop [[Glommer's Goop]] once every 2–4 days.

Killing Glommer raises the player's [[Naughtiness]] by 50 (which is the naughtiness cap), therefore Glommer is the only creature in RoG that will cause [[Krampus]] to immediately spawn when killed by the player. If killed, Glommer will drop 3 [[Monster Meat]], 1 [[Glommer's Wings]], and 2 [[Glommer's Goop]], and will re-spawn the next full moon. It falls asleep after being hit by 3 [[Sleep Dart]]s.

Glommer will not be attacked by any variety of [[Spider]] or [[Bee]].

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: It's cute, in a gross kind of way.
- **Willow**: It's fuzzy! And slimy...
- **Wolfgang**: Why you follow me, weird bug?
- **Wendy**: Well aren't you a happy little fuzzball. Die.
- **WX-78**: SENTIENT VERSION OF STONE INSECT
- **Wickerbottom**: A bizarre specimen of the insecta class.
- **Woodie**: Keep flapping, little guy!
- **Maxwell**: A flying goop factory.
- **Wagstaff**: Such a complex arrangement of oculus!
- **Wigfrid**: A majestic gööber.
- **Webber**: Nice eyes.
- **Walani**: Looks like a friend.
- **Warly**: I think I like it.
- **Woodlegs**: Ye'll be my first mate.
- **Wilba**: AY, THERE'S A BUG
- **Wormwood**: You're nice. Stay close.
- **Wheeler**: Do you like flying as much as I do?
- **Winona**: Check out the peepers on this guy.
- **Wortox**: What thoughts lurk within that curious noggin?
- **Wurt**: Hee-hee, goopy bug thing!
- **Walter**: Don't be jealous Woby, you'll always be my best friend.
- **Wanda**: Who's a cute little bug thing? You are!

## Tips

- Glommer can be killed indirectly by luring it near a [[Catcoon]] (e.g. to collect its drops for the [[Old Bell]]). This avoids summoning Krampus.
- Standing directly next to Glommer during the night can negate the sanity loss from the said time of day.
- It is possible to get the Glommer Flower with [[Woodie]] by planting a [[Lureplant]] near Glommer's Statue on a full moon, then killing the Lureplant after it has eaten the flower. Woodie can then pick up the dropped flower after returning to his normal form. Alternatively, the player can use a longer night, leave the wereform alone for a long period to turn back quickly, and get the flower before the moon ends.
- Due to the inexistence of the old bell in DST, it may be better to avoid killing Glommer, unless the player wishes to summon Krampus. Instead, it is recommended to set Glommer near or at one's base. It will passively produce [[Glommer's Goop]] (which can act as a fuel, fertilizer, or food in a pinch). Glommer also restores sanity to any player near him.
- If [[Mysterious Energy]] is activated, Glommer is able to respawn at its statue every night. Killing Glommer every day provides players with a steady stream of Krampii, and produces Glommer goop at a faster rate than Glommer's passive production rate.

The **Clockwork Rook** is the third monster in the **Chess Monsters** collection. Like the **Clockwork Knight** and **Clockwork Bishop**, the Rook is a mechanical creature generally found around **Maxwell's** parts of the world (**Chess terrain** and the **Wooden Thing**). The Clockwork Rook is the combination of a rhino and a rook chess piece.

## Behavior
Clockwork Rooks stare at players coming close to them. If too close, a Clockwork Rook will raise its front leg and slam on the ground several times before charging at and ramming the player. It will also destroy anything that stands in between it and the player, including other clockwork pieces. This is useful, as Clockwork Rooks will often kill other chess pieces in a couple of hits. Their attacks can be used to destroy structures as well, similar to **Deerclops** and **Krampus**. When the Rook hits a **Tree**, **Boulder**, or **Beehive** for example, it will quickly demolish it and leave the resources behind. This can be useful for helping to get **Marble** from **Marble Trees** without a **Pickaxe**.

Clockwork Rooks are not only naturally aggressive towards players, but also towards Pigs, Merms, Chester, Hutch, Mandrakes, Rock Lobsters, MacTusk and his son, Bunnymen and any monsters except other Clockwork Monsters and Ancient Guardians that wander too close to them.

Below is the number of hits it takes with each weapon to kill Clockwork Rooks when playing with characters with a default damage modifier. The **Weather Pain** is not included due to the random nature of its projectile.

| Weapon | No. of hits for<br />**Clockwork Rook** | No. of hits for<br />**Damaged Clockwork** |
|--------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Fishing Rod, Bug Net | 71 | 23 |
| Lucy the Axe | 18 | 10 |
| Shovel, Pitchfork | 12 | 9 |
| Hammer, Torch, Umbrella | 8 | 8 |
| Walking Cane, Willow's Lighter | 6-11 | 5 or 7 |
| Axe, Pickaxe | 6 | 6 |
| Luxury Axe, Opulent Pickaxe | 5 | 5 |
| Boomerang | 3 | 2 |
| PickSlashAxe | 2 | 1 |
| Spear | 1 | 1 |

## Tips
* A simple (albeit time-consuming) way to deal with Clockwork Rooks without taking damage is to let one chase the character into a nearby forest and let it destroy some **Trees**. This will eventually spawn a **Treeguard**, who will attack the Rook and usually kill it due to its superior health and damage output. This method is also useful for chopping down large amounts of trees and farming **Logs** and **Pine Cones**

# Snakes

Snakes are hostile [Mobs] found in the [Don't Starve: Shipwrecked](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked) DLC. They may drop [Monster Meat], [Snakeskin], or [Snake Oil]. There are two different types of Snakes, distinguished by the color of their skin.

Regular Snakes spawn from chopping down a [Jungle Tree](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_Tree), or from [Hacking](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Machete) or being in the proximity of Snake Den [Viney Bushes](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Viney_Bush). Snake-infested Viney Bushes will make hissing sounds and periodically shake, allowing them to be distinguished from normal Viney Bushes. Snakes may hide in [Berry Bush](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Berry_Bush)es as well. Spending [Dubloons](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Dubloon) at the [Slot Machine](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Slot_Machine) or digging up a [X Marks the Spot](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/X_Marks_the_Spot) treasure chest with a [Shovel](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Shovel) has a chance to spawn three Snakes. Additionally, digging up a [Sandy Pile](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Sandy_Pile) has a chance to spawn a Snake.

## Poison Snake

The **Poison Snake** is a more dangerous type of Snake. If a Poison Snake attacks the player, they will be afflicted with [Poison](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Poison). When killed, in addition to dropping Monster Meat, Snakeskin, and Snake Oil, they have a chance to drop a Venom Gland. Spending Dubloons at the Slot Machine has a chance to spawn two Poison Snakes.

### Behavior

Snakes are nocturnal creatures, and unless they are provoked by chopping down a Jungle Tree, or walking by or hacking a Viney Bush, they will not be active until **Dusk** and throughout the **Night**. When the next day begins, the Snakes that spawned from a Viney Bush will return there. If any Snakes are attacked, all other Snakes in the vicinity will join in the battle to attack their aggressor. If the player runs far enough away, the Snakes will give up, and fall asleep until another creature or the player walks near. Snakes will actively pick fights with most creatures, hostile or not.

Normal Snakes will sometimes try to eat **Meats** and **Eggs** that are left on the ground. Poison Snakes can smell Meat left on the ground from a far distance.

### Fighting Strategy

* Both types of Snakes may be kited by dodging their attack and then attacking them 3 times which kills them before they can hit the player, as long as a weapon at least as strong as a [Spear](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Spear) is used.
* Wearing a [Seashell Suit](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Seashell_Suit) will prevent the player from getting poisoned.
* Snakes can be hit once before they attack and still miss their target. This is very useful for dealing with groups of Snakes.
* Snakes are very aggressive and attack most other Mobs, including Spiders. Players can farm Snakeskin and Venom Glands by placing a [Spider Den](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Spider_Den) near a Snake-infested Viney Bush.
* Snakes can be trapped with a [Trap](https://don'tstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Trap).

### Trivia

* Red Snakes resemble either [Mud Snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_snake) or [Milk Snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_snake), while the Poison variant resembles [Banded Krait Snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_krait) or [Mangrove Snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiga_dendrophila), both of which are venomous.

## Description

The Cookie Cutter is a **Mob** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. They can be found in the **Ocean** around **Salt Formations**. They drop **Monster Meat** and occasionally **Cookie Cutter Shells** when killed.

They slowly swim up to **Boats**, jump on it and drill a hole in 3 seconds, resulting in a boat leak that drains 1/s.

They are neutral towards the player. If attacked, they will fight back, delaying the drilling process during the time of the fight. If they are killed before the end of the drilling, no leak is formed.

When a Cookie Cutter sees a boat nearby, it alerts other Cookie Cutters nearby itself, causing those Cookie Cutters to swim towards the boat as a group.

After drilling, they go back into the water and stay neutral for 30 seconds. They take 90 seconds to respawn.

They will feed on **Logs**, **Boards**, **Twigs**, **Living Logs**, **Boat Fragments**, and **Driftwood Pieces** left in the water, leaping out of the water and eating one item per jump. They seem to prioritize items left in the water over boats.

It is possible to dispatch Cookie Cutters without risking damage to one's boat by luring them away from the Salt Formations and into deeper water where they will drop out of sight and no longer pose a threat.

## Trivia

- Cookie Cutters were introduced in the **Salty Dog** update.
- Their name and their "drilling bite" are inspired by the cookiecutter shark, which itself was first discovered due to causing damage to U.S. submarines with their bite.
- Their name and behavior of eating boats is also likely a reference to the way boats in **Don't Starve Together** somewhat resemble cookies, being large discs with irregular brown patterning.

# Egg Items in-game

There are 2 basic **Egg** food items in-game, each with a cooked version. (There is one additional Egg item in the **Shipwrecked** DLC.)

There are also 3 Crock Pot recipes that require Eggs to be made (2 additional recipes in **Shipwrecked** and 1 additional recipe in **Don’t Starve Together**). Crock Pot recipes will accept both **Egg** and **Tallbird Egg**. However, Tallbird Eggs have an **Egg value** of 4 while Eggs only have an Egg value of 1. (Doydoy Eggs can also be accepted and have an Egg value of 1.)

Both of them can be found naturally in the world either in **Tallbird Nest**s or **Pengull** breeding grounds.

Eggs technically are classified as meat items: **Wigfrid** can eat them, **Wurt** will refuse to, and **Bunnymen** will be aggressive towards players if they have any item on this list.

### Description
Brainy Matter is a Food Item exclusive to the Shipwrecked DLC. It is acquired by picking the Brainy Sprout and cannot be cooked or used in a Crock Pot. When consumed, it will restore 50 Sanity and 10 Hunger, and damage the player by 10 HP. It spoils very quickly and will turn to Rot in 1 Day's time. Once picked, the Brainy Sprout will take 20 days to regenerate.

Brainy Matter can be used to create the Brain of Thought, which can be used as a portable crafting station to access recipes which have not yet been prototyped by one of the stationary crafting stations.

### Usage
#### Recipe
- **Item1**: Brainy Matter (1)
- **Item2**: Jellyfish (1)
- **Item3**: Rope (2)
- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine
- **Result**: Brain of Thought

### Tips
- Due to its fast spoilage, Brainy Matter will lose its 50 sanity consumption bonus at half a day's time after it is picked; thus, it is best to consume it immediately when looking for sanity gain.
- Corals are animals. Specifically, they are marine invertebrates living in colonies. Therefore, Wigfrid is able to eat Brainy Matter.
- If one is planning to turn the Brainy Matter into a Brain of Thought, one should plan ahead and get the necessary Jellyfish and Rope to make it once the matter is picked, as there will only be 1 day before it spoils.

# Food Value in Crock Pot

To see what type of the Food is, please refer to: [Food Type](Food Type).

The **Food Value** measures how plentifully an ingredient can fulfill a recipe's need for certain food groups, plays in and **only** in [Crock Pot]. Combined ingredients' food values (in addition to [recipe priority]) are what determine an attempt's final dish; for example: [Honey Ham] requires a meat value greater than or equal to 2.0, so in addition to [Honey], its ingredients can be 3 Jerky; 2 Jerky & 1 filler; or 1 Jerky & 2 [Drumstick]s, but 1 Jerky, 1 Drumstick, & 1 filler won't cut it.

The overall set of food values for an attempted dish is the sum of its individual ingredient values. In attempting a dish like ![Monster Meat] ![Meat] ![Meat] ![Berries], the component values are:
- +1 meat, +1 monster
- +1 meat
- +1 meat
- +0.5 fruit

When added up, the final dish's set of values will be 3.0 meat, 1.0 monster, and 0.5 fruit, resulting in [Meaty Stew].

Some ingredients value for two food groups. For example: [Monster Meat] provides 1.0 meat unit & 1 monster units, and [Eel] provides 0.5 meat unit & 1 fish units.

## Meat value
### Foods with meat value of 0.25
- ![Barnacles] ![Cooked Barnacles] 

### Foods with meat value of 0.5

# Eye Mask

**Exclusive to Don't Starve Together.**

## Structure Infobox
- **Deconstruct:** 3x Milky Whites, 2x Monster Meat
- **Icon:** Eye Mask.png
- **Equip Slot:** Head
- **Image:** Eye Mask Dropped.png
- **Scrapbook Description:** Feed this hungry eye to restore it.
- **Perk:** Absorbs 80% of physical damage. Feed food to repair.
- **Durability:** 315 hp
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** "eyemaskhat"
- **Dropped By:** Eye of Terror
- **Water Resistance:** 20% resistance

## Quotes
- Wilson: You could say I have an eye for style.
- Willow: Well, looks aren't everything.
- Wolfgang: Wolfgang not fan of squishy hat.
- Wendy: I am the beholder of the eye.
- WX-78: COMMENCING OCULAR AUGMENTATION
- Wickerbottom: I doubt that they make my prescription in this size.
- Woodie: Protective eye gear that protects everything but the eyes.
- Maxwell: How deliciously macabre.
- Wigfrid: Follower of Heimdall, watch over my path!
- Webber: We have even MORE eyes and teeth!
- Winona: Guess I'll really be seein' the world through different eyes.
- Warly: I must remember to avoid cutting onions while wearing this.
- Wormwood: Friend is watching
- Wortox: Well, isn't this a sight for sore eyes. Hyuyuyu!
- Wurt: Feels like hug from a slug.
- Wobbles: Don't worry Woby. It's just a hat, see?
- Wanda: How bizarre... I simply must try it on!

## Scrapbook Info
Feed this hungry eye to restore it.

## Durability Repair Calculations
- Absolute value is calculated. Monster Meat or Red Caps, which provide -20 health, are calculated as if they were positive 20.
- Health has a multiplier of 4.
- Hunger has a multiplier of 1.75.
- Sanity values are ignored.

A Monster Meat can repair the Eye Mask by 112.8125 durability.

## Prototype Tips
- If a player gives the Eye Mask any glow-related food, it will glow without the need to wear a light-related item. This can be used to avoid the sanity cost of eating a Glow Berry.
- Since durability restoration isn't hurt by negative food values, it can be efficiently repaired with otherwise harmful food such as Monster Meat or even Rot.

## Trivia
- The Eye Mask is introduced in the "An Eye for an Eye" update, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's Terraria.
- In Terraria, the Eye Mask (Eye of Cthulhu Mask) is an exclusive drop from Eye of Cthulhu, which only serves as a vanity item.
- When fed while the item is placed on the ground, it plays a little animation.

## Trivia
- Pan Flutes are named after [Pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)), the Greek god of animals and music.
- The Pan Flute is one of the 8 ways to put mobs to sleep, with the other methods being the Sleep Dart, Napsack, Wickerbottom's book Sleepytime Stories, Stuffed Night Cap, reviving from Life Giving Amulet, and eating or cooking a Mandrake.
- Using a Pan Flute near a Bird in flight will cause it to fall to the ground, ready to be picked up for a short time.
- It is also apparently Wortox's flute, according to his character quote. This would make sense as the Pan Flute is shown to be shadow magic, and Wortox is an imp, which, according to folklore, dabble in the dark arts.
- It is also shown in the portrait for his Verdant skin, which has similarities to Satyrs, who would use Pan Flutes in folk tales.

# Opulent Pickaxe

**Infobox:**
- Equip slot: hands
- Icon: ![Opulent Pickaxe](Opulent Pickaxe.png)
- Image: ![Opulent Pickaxe Dropped](Opulent Pickaxe Dropped.png)
- Tier: 2
- Filter: ![Tools Filter](Pic32|Tools Filter)
- Ingredient 1: Twigs (multiplier 4)
- Ingredient 2: Gold Nugget (multiplier 2)
- Damage: 27.2
- Durability: 132 uses ([Mining](Tools#Mining Tools))
- Stack: Does not stack
- Spawn Code: "goldenpickaxe"
- Perk: Mines rocks
- Name: Opulent Pickaxe
- Description: Break down rocks like a boss.

**Exclusivity:**
Don't Starve, Reign of Giants, Shipwrecked, Hamlet, Don't Starve Together

**Quotes:**
- Wilson: "Hey, isn't gold really soft?"
- Willow: "It won't light rocks on fire, but at least it's shiny."
- Wolfgang: "Fancy pickaxe do better smash."
- Wendy: "At least I can smash rocks with style."
- WX-78: "GOLD IS MORE DURABLE?"
- Wickerbottom: "The most malleable of metals, but let's see how this mines."
- Woodie: "Almost an axe, but not quite."
- Maxwell: "This must be game logic."
- Wagstaff: "Strange, the gold makes it more durable, not less."
- Wigfrid: "Göld för göld."
- Webber: "The finest pickaxe of them all."
- Walani: "I picked a good one."
- Warly: "That looks nice."
- Woodlegs: "Thet pick is made o' mighty soft metal."
- Wilba: "TIS PICKAXE O' SHINY."
- Wormwood: "Pretty pokey"
- Wheeler: "I used a precious metal to make a rock smasher!"
- Winona: "A shiny way to smash up rocks."
- Wortox: "The mortals say you have to spend gold to make gold."
- Wurt: "It stronger than normal rock cracker."

**Usage:**
To mine an object with the Pickaxe, right-click it from the inventory to equip it and left-click on the object. Once the character begins to mine, hold down the LMB or Spacebar to keep mining until the object breaks. Alternatively, one can mine faster by repeatedly clicking LMB with specific timing.

**Recipe:**
- Item 1: Opulent Pickaxe
- Item 2: Luxury Axe
- Item 3: Thulecite (count 2)
- Result: PickSlashAxe
- Ancient: 2 (yes)

**Skins:**
- The Woven - Elegant Ornate Nordic Pickaxe skin was introduced during the official Year of the Carrat event in 2020.

**Bugs:**
- There is a glitch where the Pickaxe (and other tools) can have 0% durability and remain equipped in the weapon slot instead of breaking. It disappears when the player opens and closes the map, unequips the tool, or quits and resumes the game. Trying to mine something with the bugged Pickaxe will often crash the game or will only cause the player to examine the rock.

**Trivia:**
- The Opulent Pickaxe was added in the October 2nd, 2012 update.
- When the Opulent Pickaxe is equipped, a 'ding' sound can be heard.
- In reality, gold is not a practical metal to be used in tools or weapons as it is a soft metal; it would easily deform and break. This is often remarked when examined by some characters.
  - Maxwell breaks the fourth wall upon examining the Opulent Pickaxe when he states, "This must be game logic."
  - Despite gold's softness, low-purity gold would still be rather tough; almost certainly tougher than flint. Gold would also be repairable, whereas flint would have to be replaced.

### The King of the Merms Description
The King of the Merms is a Mob exclusive to the Don't Starve Together character Wurt. Born after a Merm gains 50 hunger while on the Royal Tapestry, he has 1000 health and regenerates 2 hp per second. He cannot attack or move but will spawn up to 4 Loyal Merm Guards when his health drops below 75%. The required materials to build the Royal Tapestry are 20 Kelp Fronds, 10 Pig Skin, and 15 Beefalo Wool. If the Tapestry is destroyed while the King is on it, he will immediately die.

### Interactions
The King will only accept food from Wurt and refuse to accept any items from any other characters. The only way for a character other than Wurt to be able to give him anything is by wearing the Clever Disguise Wurt can craft. The King does not lose Health if he eats Kelp or Durians. However, he can lose and gain Health from other Foods he eats and can therefore be killed or healed by feeding him.

### Boosts and Effects
As long as the King of the Merms is alive, all Merms receive a stat boost. Wurt players change stats to 250 Health, 250 Hunger, and 200 Sanity corresponding of a bonus of +100 hp, +50 hunger, and +50 sanity. Normal Merms gain +60 hp and +10 damage. Loyal Merm Guards gain +460 Hp and +30 damage.

### Trading with the King of the Merms
Wurt or a player wearing a Clever Disguise can offer Freshwater Fish, Live Eel, or Ocean Fishes to the King of the Merms in exchange for various resources. The King gives 1 to 2 more items if the fish he receives is Heavy.

### The King's Quests
- **The King's Pauldron Quest**: Wurt with "The King's Pauldron Quest" skill can give to Merm King a Marble Suit. If there is a Merm King with Marble Suit, all loyal Merms with head armor will have 15% damage protection.
- **The King's Crown Quest**: Wurt with "The King's Crown Quest" skill can give to Merm King a Thulecite Crown. If there is Merm King with Thulecite Crown, all loyal Merms will learn to dodge.
- **The King's Trident Quest**: Wurt with "The King's Trident Quest" skill can give a Strident Trident to the Merm King. If there is Merm King with a Strident Trident, all loyal Merms, as well as Wurt, will deal 5% more damage.

- **Sated Sovereign II**: Merm King's maximum hunger up by 50%.
