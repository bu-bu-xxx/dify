## Behavior
Wildbores are neutral Mobs in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They are the Shipwrecked counterpart to Pigs and wear a grass skirt, have a hunched posture, and are covered in brown fur. They spawn naturally and live in Wildbore Houses on beaches, which they will return to at dusk.

### Interaction
- Wildbore will eat any Food items on the ground. The player can befriend them by feeding them Meats or Eggs, after which they will assist the player in chopping down trees, hacking Bamboo Patch and Viney Bushes, and attacking mobs.
- Wildbores have an annoyance threshold. Annoyance increases when the player makes the Wildbore run away by standing close to him, and when the threshold is reached, he will start attacking the player unless playing as Wilba.
- Wildbores will attack the player aggressively if they have hammered down the Wildbore's House.

### Combat
- Wildbores use a unique kind of kiting to fight their enemies. When provoked, a Wildbore will prepare itself and charge toward its target, either punching or slamming both fists down.
- Attacking a Wildbore after it starts charging for the player character allows the player character to strike first, canceling his attack.

### Werewolf Transformation
- Like Pigs, if a Wildbore eats 4 pieces of meat-based Monster Foods, or during a full moon, it will turn into a Werepig. A typical Werepig will transform back into a normal Wildbore after 4 game hours of being a Werepig or at the start of the next day, whichever comes first.

### Resistances
- Wildbore takes 2 blasts from the Ice Staff to be frozen and 2 Sleep Darts to be put to sleep.

## Fighting Strategy
**Weapon Hits:**
- Health: 250
- Ice Staff: 2
- Sleep Dart: 2

## Wildbore Names
Much like Pigs before them, Wildbores will have a random name given to them. The name may be viewed by mousing over the Wildbore.

## Quotes
These quotes are what Wildbores say in various situations. They are currently mostly identical to Pig quotes, with some differences and additions.

## Trivia
- "Wildbore" is a portmanteau of the words "wild boar" (a type of animal hailing from the family Suidae, which includes pigs), and "bore", with the latter possibly due to its short temper.
- Wildbores are able to say four-word sentences, unlike Pigs who can only say three-word sentences.
- Wildbores will automatically attack Webber, just like Pigs.

## Bugs
- If a Wildbore House is near the ocean, occasionally, they may glitch across the shore and will be able to walk across oceans despite it being treated as semi-impassable tiles.

# Webber

## Character Information

- **Name**: Webber

- **Health**: 175
- **Hunger**: 175
- **Sanity**: 100

  - ![Shoo Box](Shoo_Box)
  - ![Healing Glop](Healing_Glop)
  - ![Warrior Switcherdoodle](Warrior_Switcherdoodle)
  - ![Dangler Switcherdoodle](Dangler_Switcherdoodle)
  - ![Cave Switcherdoodle](Cave_Switcherdoodle)
  - ![Spitter Switcherdoodle](Spitter_Switcherdoodle)
  - ![Shatter Switcherdoodle](Shatter_Switcherdoodle)
  - ![Nurse Switcherdoodle](Nurse_Switcherdoodle)
  - ![Strider Switcherdoodle](Strider_Switcherdoodle)
- **Start Items**: 
  - Monster Meat ×2
  - Spider Eggs
  - Webby Whistle
- **Spawn Code**: "webber"

## Abilities

In **Don't Starve Together**, Webber can safely eat Monster Foods without any adverse health effects, grow a silky smooth beard, and befriend Spiders. Webber can also safely eat raw Meat without penalties.

Webber starts the game with 2 Monster Meat, a Webby Whistle, and Spider Eggs that can be used to plant a Spider Den.

### Survivor Items Filter

- **Spider Eggs**: Exists both in his Survivor Items as well as the Structures filter.
- **Den Decorating Set**: Allows Webber to decorate up to five regular Spider dens.
- **Webby Whistle**: Can be blown into to call out Spiders from nearby dens, wake up sleeping Spiders, and order the befriended Spiders into a pacified state where they will lose their current targets and will not eat Meat off the ground. Has 50 uses.
- **Shoo Box**: De-aggroes all Spiders in the area and dismisses all befriended Spiders. Has 10 uses.
- **Healing Glop**: Applies an area of effect heal for all Spiders nearby, including Webber himself.
- **Various Switcherdoodles**: Can be fed to any Spider to transform them into a different Spider type while also befriending them. If the player wishes to avoid this, they may place the Switcherdoodle on the ground and allow the Spider to eat it on their own.

### Spiders

Spiders are neutral to Webber unless provoked. He may also give them any sort of Meat item to ally up to 3 Spiders at a time. Follower Spiders do not have a loyalty timer unlike other follower mobs and will only stop following due to their or Webber's death, disconnections, travel between the caves and surface, or the Shoo Box.

Once befriended, Spiders will fight alongside Webber and may be picked up and carried within the inventory. Spiders in the inventory can be fed with meat to lengthen its life. Spiders may also be picked up when they're asleep, or trapped within a Trap. Spiders remember whether or not they were befriended after dropping them from the inventory. Feeding a Spider in the inventory will befriend it if it wasn't already, and can befriend nearby Spiders as well.

Hats can be equipped to Spiders, both befriended and not, which will give them the appropriate effects of the hat where applicable. Picking up the Spider will put the hat in your inventory as well. If the Spider dies or retreats back into a den, the hat will drop onto the ground.

As long as Webber is the one carrying the Eye Bone or Star-Sky, Spiders will not attack Chester or Hutch respectively. This does **not** apply to Spider Queens or to the Spiders spawned by them.

#### Dens

Webber has the ability to shave any Spider Den using the razor to downgrade them by 1 level. Shaving a Spider Den will give one Silk for each stage. Shaving a den also destroys decorations on the den and can destroy a den if it is level 1. Destroying a den this way will cause all Spiders inside to become aggressive towards Webber.

Webber can also decorate dens with the Den Decorating Set. Decorated dens have a much smaller webbing size, stop growing, and pacify all Spiders that come within a certain radius of the den. Attacking a Spider from a decorated den will destroy the decorations and revert it

# Wickerbottom

## Character Overview

![Wickerbottom Lightning](Wickerbottom Lightning.png "Wickerbottom reading the 'The End Is Nigh' book")

### Special Power

Wickerbottom's special power is a Crafting Tab called "Books". This gives her the ability to craft 5 different magical Books with Papyrus and other different ingredients. She can read these for beneficial effects, but at the cost of a lot of Sanity.

### Books

- **[Birds of the World](Birds of the World)** - Summons 20-30 Birds in a circle around Wickerbottom.
- **[Applied Horticulture](Applied Horticulture)** - Advances most Plants and Farms around Wickerbottom to the next stage of their growth.
- **[Sleepytime Stories](Sleepytime Stories)** - Puts all nearby Mobs to sleep, similar to a Pan Flute.
- **[On Tentacles](On Tentacles)** - Summons 3 Tentacles at random locations near Wickerbottom.
- **[The End is Nigh](The End is Nigh)** - Summons 16 Lightning strikes at random locations near Wickerbottom.

### Sanity Drain and Usage

The Books can be read a maximum of 5 times each and drain 33 or 50 Sanity with each reading session. Wickerbottom's higher maximum Sanity offsets this, but eventually, some Sanity restoring means will be required for continued usage of the Books.

### Science Machine Recipes

Wickerbottom can make all Science Machine recipes without having to build the Science Machine, but does not gain the 15 Sanity per prototype for those since she already knows them at the start of the game. The rest of the recipes can be prototyped with a Science Machine even though they would normally require an Alchemy Engine. The one exception is the book "On Tentacles" - she needs an Alchemy Engine to prototype it.

## Disadvantage

Wickerbottom lacks the ability to sleep in a Tent, Bed Roll, or Fur Roll due to her being an insomniac. This means that crafting those Items and Structures would be a waste of resources and the player will need other means to restore Sanity.

She also hates spoiled Food, causing her Sanity to suffer greatly. Eating stale food costs her no Sanity, but neither does it restore any. Stale Food also restores less Hunger and less Health than fresh Food of the same type. Raw Food has no penalties outside of its normal ones if it is fresh.

### Food Stages and Effects

| Stage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Green (Fresh) | Restores the full amount of Hunger, Health, and Sanity for a given Food |
| Yellow (Stale) | Restores 1/3 of Hunger, 1/4 of Health for a given food and doesn't restore any Sanity |
| Red (Spoiled) | Restores 1/6 of Hunger for a given food, doesn't restore any Health and decreases Sanity by 10 |

## Downloadable Content

In the Reign of Giants (RoG), Don't Starve Together, and Shipwrecked (SW) DLCs, Wickerbottom will be unable to sleep in the Siesta Lean-to.

In Shipwrecked, due to the lack of Tentacles in the world, the "On Tentacles" Book has been replaced with **[Joy of Volcanology](Joy of Volcanology)**. When read, this Book will summon 4 Dragoon Eggs to fall at her location, dealing massive Fire damage. Players can still craft and use "On Tentacles" but only if they use the Seaworthy and travel to a non-Shipwrecked world.

## Tips

* During the early days, it is advised to craft a Backpack and Shovel as soon as possible to start storing dug Grass Tufts, Saplings, and Berry Bushes for the player's future base, saving them the time to go back and acquire these items.
* Having early access to variety of books is valuable, therefore setting the base in reasonable proximity to Swamps is a good strategy, and visiting Swamps frequently is a requirement to use Books reliably.
* Eating Cooked Green Caps is highly recommended during the early days, as well as going after the Tam o' Shanter in Winter and creating Bee Boxes for Taffy in later days, in order to get good use out of the Books.

### Book Strategies

* "Applied Horticulture" can be used in tandem with a Mushroom Planter to cultivate large amounts of Green Caps, provided the player has an excess of living logs.
* In RoG or DST, eating cooked Cactus Flesh is also a good way to quickly restore Sanity, however Jelly Salad is the go-to end game Sanity restoring food considering its easy and cheap recipe and 50 sanity gain.
* "Bird

## Behavior

The Rockjaw is aggressive towards anything that isn't another Rockjaw, even flying birds. When fighting Creatures on water, it simply swims up to it and bites it, dealing 30 damage, before kiting it by swimming away for about 6 seconds and attacking again.

When fighting creatures located on a Boat, they jump on the Boat and perform a triple AoE attack before going back into the water. If a Rockjaw jumps on the boat three times without hitting a player with its attacks, it will lose interest and begin roaming again. Just like Beefalos and Bunnymen, a Rockjaw regenerates lost health over time, taking 3 days to regenerate its full health.

If a Rockjaw is attacked, Rockjaws nearby will also join the fight. It will despawn when unloaded from the player's vicinity.

## Hunting

- **Weapon Hits**: 
  - Ice Staff: 3
  - Sleep Dart: 4

## Trivia

- Rockjaws were introduced in the Troubled Waters update.
- Rockjaws are considered Monsters and are auto-attacked by not only Pigs or Bunnymen, but also Gnarwails.
- When Rockjaws are near the player, boat horn-like sounds can be heard.

# Shadow Creature

_A creature made of the dark fuel! I must get closer!_ - Wagstaff

## Description
Shadow Creatures are a type of **Monster** in **Don't Starve**. Hostile Shadow Creatures have a **Sanity aura** that drains the player's **Sanity** at a rate of -100/min., but killing one will restore a small amount of Sanity. Shadow Creatures drop **Nightmare Fuel** when killed.

## Spawning
Shadow Creatures will spawn as nearly transparent entities when the player's Sanity drops below 82.5%. As Sanity continues to drop, they become more "real" (less transparent) and will begin to attack a player with less than 15% Sanity. It's not unusual for 3 Shadow Creatures to spawn at the same time and attack the player when this happens. They cannot be examined and are visible only to the player, meaning followers cannot help attack them. Shadow Creatures are immune to **Tooth Traps** and **Bee Mines**. Nearby Shadow Creatures will prevent the player from using a **Straw Roll**, **Fur Roll**, **Tent**, or **Siesta Lean-to**. In **Don't Starve Together**, players can assist those plagued by Shadow Creatures by attacking them. However, this causes the Shadow Creature to attack and follow that player instead.

## Nightmare Versions
Nightmare versions of Shadow Creatures appear in the **Ruins** and occasionally **Caves**, spawning from **Nightmare Lights** or **Nightmare Fissures** during the **Nightmare Cycle**. They're hostile regardless of Sanity, and will pursue the player until the Nightmare Cycle has reached the Calm Phase, at which point they despawn by turning into Nightmare Fuel (**Don't Starve**) or disappearing without any drops (DLCs and **Don't Starve Together**). Note that killing a Shadow Creature that has spawned from a Nightmare Light will not restore the player's Sanity.

## Types of Shadow Creatures

### Shadow Creatures that can be killed to get Nightmare Fuel:
- **Terrorbeak**
- **Crawling Horror**
- **Lurking Nightmare**
- **Terrorclaw**
- **Swimming Horror**
- **Parasitic Shadeling**
- **Resting Horror**

### Shadow Creatures that cannot be attacked:
- **Shadow Eyes**
- **Shadow Hand**
- **Shadow Watcher**
- **Mr. Skitts**
- **Mr. Skittish**
- **Wavey Jones**

## Categories
- **Mobs**
- **Cave Creatures**

- **Hostile Creatures**
- **Neutral Creatures**
- **Sanity Loss**
- **Surface Creatures**

# Shopkeep

The **Shopkeep** is a **Pig Trader** **Mob** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. She is a pig with yellow hair. She's a shopkeeper and can be found in **Pig Cities**. She will buy **Clippings** for 1 **Oinc** each.

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: Good day, shopkeep.
- **Willow**: I bet their life is super boring.
- **Wolfgang**: Wolfgang is here to see wares!
- **Wendy**: A life filled with endless mediocre service.
- **WX-78**: SELLER OF TANGIBLE GOODS
- **Wickerbottom**: I had better dust off my bartering skills.
- **Woodie**: Looks like the shopkeep.
- **Maxwell**: That's the shopkeep.
- **Wagstaff**: What a thoroughly creepy smile!
- **Wigfrid**: Shöpkeep, prepare tö barter!
- **Webber**: Anything good for sale today?
- **Walani**: Anything good today?
- **Warly**: Greetings!
- **Woodlegs**: Ye be a boar!
- **Wilba**: HER HAIR DOTH TOO MUCH, METHINKS
- **Wormwood**: Likes friend hair
- **Wheeler**: Someone who appreciates her town's landscaping.
- **Choose**: Wilba

## Behavior

One Shopkeep may spawn from a **Town House**, and will wander randomly around their house and eat any edible items left on the ground, including **Pig Skin**. Every so often they will drop one **Manure** where they are standing. If the player picks up the Manure, the nearest Pig Trader will approach and give them one Oinc, along with an accompanying quote.

Whenever there is a hostile mob nearby, or a player targets them or another Pig Trader or **Royal Guard** near them, they will enter a panicked state. They will begin to move around semi-randomly in a direction away from the aggressor.

They will attempt to return to their house in the evening, and if they cannot reach their house or their house is destroyed they will seek the nearest light source and stand next to it until night, at which point they will fall asleep on the ground.

### Scrapbook Info
An automaton capable of collecting and organizing items into containers. Store an item in a container next to it and it will know what to do!

### Details
- **W.O.B.O.T.** is an unique Item/Mob exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the **From Beyond** updates. It can be found broken laying on the floor of the **Junk Yard**. To make it work, it has to be repaired with an **Auto-Mat-O-Chanic**.

- W.O.B.O.T. can be carried like an item in the inventory. When placing it on the ground, W.O.B.O.T. will collect nearby items from the floor and put them in a **Chest** if any of these already contains one of the specific items. This also works for almost all other containers like **Scaled Chest**s, **Ice Box**es, **Salt Box**es, **Chester**, **Tin Fishin' Bin** and all kinds of **Backpack**. However, it cannot put items into the **Magician's Chest**, Shadow Chester and portable containers like **Polar Bearger Bin** and **Tackle Box**. It can only collect one kind of item at once and only up to its stacksize limit, so reaching the limit will force it to store the stack before collecting the next stack or other items. W.O.B

# Biome

A **Biome** is best described as an environment or habitat for in-game creatures found in the game world. Each is typically made up of a single type of terrain. Biomes are randomly generated at world creation and can be of any size or shape, although they often have common and unique features, and vary in habitability. A game world is made by combining many Biomes together like a giant puzzle, which can be better seen on the [Map](Map). Sometimes the Biomes are combined into continents, and sometimes they form islands which may or may not be connected by land [bridge](bridge)s, sometimes only being accessible via [Wormhole](Wormhole)s.

Biomes are usually differentiated by the type of terrain they are composed of, for example, Forest or Savanna terrains, being darker green or golden brown respectively. Each type of biome usually contains the same type of resources and creatures, though they may be specific to that biome.

# Marsh Biome

The **Marsh**, also known as the **Swamp**, is one of the [Biomes] in the game and is characterized by its abundance of [Marsh Turf]. It is considered the most dangerous and inhospitable Biome due to its native [Tentacles], which attack without provocation, and [Merm]s that are hostile at close proximity.

## Characteristics

## Survival Tips

It is recommended to keep moving and stay on the roads to avoid being attacked by the Marsh's hostile inhabitants. [Tentacles] cannot spawn on roads, which makes them useful when moving around.

### Terrain

- **Turf**: ![Marsh Turf](Marsh Turf Texture.png)

This type of marsh is found in [Cave]s. It includes all the things a normal marsh has except for [Mermhouse]s. It is rich in [Reeds], and a player can harvest an average of fifty [Cut Reeds] in the whole area. However, this biome is also infested with [Tentacles] and at least five tier-three [Spider Den]s. Therefore, players should take extreme caution when venturing into this area.

# Main|Portable Crock Pot

![Warly Dishes](Warly Dishes.jpg)

Warly begins his adventure with a Portable Crock Pot; in addition to the functions of a normal [Crock Pot], it can cook four special food items: [Sweet Potato Soufflé], [Monster Tartare], [Fresh Fruit Crepes], and [Mussel Bouillabaisse]. The Portable Crock Pot can be carried around and placed at any time, so Warly does not have to build a [Crock Pot] in order to cook his meals. In addition, Warly starts with a [Chef Pouch] that doubles the life of Food items placed in it; he also knows its crafting recipe (1 [Cloth] and 1 [Rope]).

Warly gains 33% more Hunger, [Health], and [Sanity] from Crock Pot meals, letting him regain more Health and Sanity than other Characters from those meals. If the food would reduce any of these attributes, the amount is decreased by 33% instead.

## Disadvantage

In addition to a 33% faster hunger drain, Warly gains only 70% of the Hunger, Sanity, and Health from raw foods, 80% from dried foods, and 90% from foods cooked over fire. If the food has negative effects on these attributes, the effect is increased by 30%, 20%, and 10% respectively instead. Ideally, his food should always be cooked in a Crock Pot, which can take valuable time depending on what was cooked.

Additionally, Warly likes variety in his diet. He remembers all food items eaten for 1.75 days since the last time they are eaten; if he eats the Food items that he remembers eating, he only gains a percentage of his normal Hunger, Sanity, and Health granted by the Food [Item], while the negative effects are amplified by the same percentage. The percentage depends on how many times the food item is eaten before it is forgotten. The first repetition of the food item applies 10% penalty, the second 20%, the third 35%, the fourth 50% and finally the fifth repetition applies 70% penalty on the food values. Any further repetition does not increase this penalty.

The **Banker** is a Pig Trader Mob exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. He wears a black suit and buys most kinds of gems for Oincs. There is no limit to the amount trades done in a day. He can be found in the Pig City, Swinesbury, and Palace City.

### Behavior
One Banker may spawn from a Town House and will wander randomly around their house and eat any edible items left on the ground, including Pig Skin. Every so often they will drop one Manure where they are standing, and if the player picks up that manure the Banker will approach them and give them one Oinc, along with an accompanying Quote.

Whenever there is a hostile mob nearby, or a player targets them or another Pig Trader or Royal Guard near them, they will enter a panicked state. They will begin to move around semi-randomly in a direction away from the aggressor.

They will attempt to return to their house in the evening, and if they cannot reach their house or their house is destroyed they will seek the nearest light source and stand next to it until night, when they will sleep on the ground.

# Survival Mode

## Overview
![Beginning a new game puts the player in Survival Mode](Sandbox Mode.png "thumb")
**Survival Mode** (formerly known as **Sandbox Mode**) is the default game mode in *Don't Starve*. When starting a new world, players enter Survival Mode. Each world is randomly generated and can be optionally [customized](World Customization) before creation, allowing players to specify various options such as the frequency of [Hound] attacks or the occurrence of [Seasons].

Upon entering the world, players are greeted by [Maxwell (NPC)], who advises them to find food before nightfall.

## Gameplay
There is no preset goal in Survival Mode other than survival. Players can gather [Things] scattered around the world and build the [Teleportato], which allows them to move to another survival world while keeping their knowledge and portable items, but leaving behind the current world. To enter [Adventure Mode], players must locate [Maxwell's Door], which is randomly positioned in each world, usually far from the initial spawn point.

## Customization Interface
![Players can customize their worlds using this interface](Edit.jpg)
Players can use the above interface to customize their worlds.

## Description

Jellyfish are passive Mobs found in the Shipwrecked DLC. They float around in the shallow Ocean, sometimes in groups. New ones will spawn every 60 seconds to replace those who are lost. They will not attack the player if they are approached, but if they are attacked with a melee Weapon, they will automatically shock the player, doing 5 points of Health damage. They will not actively attack the player. Once killed, their carcass will float in the water until picked up.

Jellyfish can also be caught alive using a Net or a Trawl Net or killed safely when equipped with an item that provides electrical resistance (such as the Snakeskin Hat or Snakeskin Jacket). As inventory items, they can be murdered by right-clicking them to produce Dead Jellyfish, which can be eaten to restore 10 Hp and 10 Hunger, making them a great way to restore Hunger and Health at sea. A Jellyfish placed on the ground will immediately turn into a Dead Jellyfish. They will have a short animation where they flop twice before settling like any normal Dead Jellyfish.

A Jellyfish can be cooked to make Cooked Jellyfish, while Dead Jellyfish can be dried on a Drying Rack to acquire Dried Jellyfish. Jellyfish can be used in the Crock Pot, they count as 1 unit of Fishes and 1 unit of Monster.

Jellyfish take 2 blasts from the Ice Staff to be frozen and 1 Sleep Dart to be put to sleep. They are considered innocent creatures, and killing one adds 1 point to the player's Krampus#Naughtiness level, which can cause Krampus to appear.

## Behavior
- **Chance to spawn Skittersquids:**

| Moon Cycle | Chance |
|------------|--------|
| New Moon   | 25%    |
| Quarter Moon | 12.5%  |
| Half Moon | 6.5%    |
| 3/4 Moon | 3%      |
| Full Moon | 0%     |

Skittersquids can travel both on land and in the Ocean. They emit light while their eye is open and try to eat fish near them, screeching when they miss one. When attacked, they launch globs of ink at players to obscure their vision and perform a spinning blade attack.

## Trivia
- Skittersquids were introduced in the "Hook, Line, and Inker" update.
- They allow Light Bulbs to be obtainable on servers with Caves disabled.
- Wickerbottom's quote for Skittersquid literally translates to "Luminous Squid".
- Skittersquids might have been inspired by the Haploteuthis ferox from the short story "The Sea Raiders" (H. G. Wells, 1896).
- When a Skittersquid blinks, the light disappears.

- **Filter**: ![Wendy Filter](Wendy_Filter.png)

## Abilities and Features
Wendy's main special power is her ability to summon her dead twin sister, [Abigail]. Wendy starts with [Abigail's Flower] in her inventory. She will be able to summon Abigail immediately and gain 15 sanity points.

Wendy can ask Abigail to stay close to her or roam more freely via Abigail's flower. In the "Sooth" state, Abigail follows Wendy and will attack [Mobs] that either attack Wendy or that Wendy herself attacks. In the "Rile up" state, Abigail attacks every Mob near Wendy, enemy or neutral. Wendy can decide to retire Abigail by attacking her (using force attack) or clicking on her while dragging an Abigail's Flower, losing 15 sanity points in the process.

Abigail starts with a health pool of 150 health points. Her health changes to 300 health after 1 day and goes to 600 health after 1 additional day. The process is 4 times faster if there is a fully decorated [Sisturn] in the World. Abigail goes back to her initial health when she is destroyed by an enemy or when Wendy is revived after death. Abigail has a protective shield. When attacked, a protective shield surrounds her and absorbs all other damage within a small window of time after the first attack.

Wendy can assist [Pipspook]s to recover their lost toys and gain [Mourning Glory]s as a reward. Wendy does not lose sanity due to [Ghost]s, Pipspooks, and [Ghost Characters]. Ghosts are neutral towards Wendy, but will attack if provoked.

Wendy can craft 6 [Ghostly Elixir]s:

| Icon | Name | Effect | Duration | Badge Indicator | Recipe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Revenant Restorative](Revenant_Restorative.png) | [Revenant Restorative] | Restores bonus 2 Abigail's health per second (960 health restored in total over duration) | 8 minutes (1 day) | ![Revenant Restorative Buff Badge](Revenant_Restorative_Buff_Badge.png) | Mourning Glory x1, Spider Gland x1 |

# Nightmare Cycle

The **Nightmare Cycle** is a state of magical flux associated with the **Ruins** and a few parts of the **Caves**. This cycle has slightly random durations for each phase and is entirely independent from the surface day/night cycle, lunar cycle, and seasons.

## Phases of the Nightmare Cycle
- **Calm**: 6 to 7.5 minutes (DS: 4.75 to 5.75 min.)
- **Warning**: 1.5 to 3 minutes (DS: 1 to 1.5 min.)
- **Nightmare**: 2.5 to 4 minutes (DS: 2.5 to 3.5 min.)
- **Dawn**: 1 to 2.5 minutes (DS: 15 to 45 seconds)

The entire cycle lasts 11-17 minutes (DS: 7.5-11.5 min).

Upon activating the **Ancient Gateway** by inserting the **Ancient Key**, the Cycle will be locked at its peak nightmare phase until the Gateway is deactivated when the key is removed or the Ancient Fuelweaver defeated.

The **Thulecite Medallion** changes color to indicate the current phase of the Nightmare Cycle. The character quotes change when it is examined in each phase (within the phase for the Nightmare phase). It is particularly helpful for timing a foray past the **Splumonkey**s into the ruins, or out again. Also for exploring **Stalagmite Terrain** or the **Lichen** fields where **Nightmare Fissures** may be found.

Fissures in the Caves will open and close independent of each other and independent of the Nightmare Cycle in the ruins, Fissures in the ruins will all be synchronized with the Nightmare Cycle. **Verify**

## Prototype Tips
**Using a Bush Hat to avoid Shadow Creatures:**
![Nightmare Cycle safety](Nightmare%20Cycle%20safety.jpg)

- Time cave exploration and travel carefully to avoid aggroing a host of nightmare creatures and shadow splumonkeys. Running for several minutes may be impractical if the weather is too wet or cold, or if you are starving, or run out of light. Running

# Autumn

Autumn is one of the four **seasons** from the **Reign of Giants** DLC. It has a 50% chance to be the starting season instead of **Spring**. Autumn is mostly a peaceful season, comparable to **Summer** in the vanilla version of the game.

![Autumn promotional image](DLC Poster Autumn.png "Autumn depicted in a promotional image for Reign of Giants.")

## Characteristics
- Autumn lasts 20 days by default, so the first Autumn lasts either from day 1 to 20, or from day 37 to 56. This will change if the length of the seasons is edited in the **Sandbox Mode** Preferences.
- Stages in **Adventure Mode** may have different seasonal variations.

## Gameplay
- During the majority of autumn, nights are short. This allows moving around more often without fearing the dark. It also means that less supplies are needed to survive the darkness.
- During Autumn, the player does not have to worry about **Overheating** or **Freezing**, there is only occasionally **Rain**, **Farm Crops** grow normally, **Walrus Camp**s are not active, **Red Hounds** may occasionally appear rather than **Normal Hounds** during timed Hound attacks, **Redbirds and Crows** appear, and the **Koalefant** appears with a red hide. Also, **Birchnut Trees** will start to lose their leaves, which change color, and fully-grown ones will yield extra **Birchnut**s when cut down. However, in Don't Starve Together, they have the highest chance of spawning **Poison Birchnut Trees**. Any resource such as **Grass**, **Saplings**, or **Berry Bushes** that withered in the Summer will return to their harvested state at the beginning of Autumn. **Mini Glaciers** begin to form during autumn.

## Seasonal Giant
Autumn's seasonal **Giant** is the **Bearger**. It will eat **Food** off the ground and destroy any **Structures** and **Plants** that get in its way when it is rampaging.

## Transition
Autumn leads to **Winter**, so players might want to spend their first Autumn preparing for the harsh weather that will soon be upon them.

# Wilson

![Wilson](Wilson.png)

## Character Information
- **Health**: 150
- **Hunger**: 150
- **Sanity**: 200

## Unlocking
Wilson is the default playable character, being unlocked from the start.

## Perk
Wilson grows a beard over time. The beard provides **Freezing** resistance as it grows longer, and can be shaved with a **Razor** to yield **Beard Hair** and restore +10 **Sanity**. Refer to the table below for the statistics of Wilson's beard:

![Wilson's different stages of beard growth](Wilson_Beard_Growth.jpg)

| Stage       | Growth Time | Yield (Beard Hair) | Insulation |
|------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Short      | 4 days      | 1 (0.25/day)      | 15s        |
| Long       | 8 days      | 3 (0.43/day)      | 45s        |
| Magnificent| 16 days     | 9 (0.6/day)       | 135s       |

## Prototype Tips
- The earliest one can build a Meat Effigy is on day 11. Shave as soon as possible for 1 hair, and shave the Long Beard for the other 3. This is not the most efficient way, but it is the quickest (outside of lowering **Sanity** to hunt **Beardlings**).
- Wilson keeps his Beard when he uses a **Wooden Thing** to move to a new world. This proves useful in **Adventure Mode** when "King of Winter" or "The Game is Afoot" are still to be encountered.
- As the Beard doesn't grow longer after 16 days and the player loses it on resurrection or by changing characters, it is most efficient to shave after every sixteenth day, unless Winter is coming. In terms of gaining **Sanity**, shaving every 5 days will yield the best results.
- Wilson's Beard will take exactly 15 days to grow to its full length (full length at the beginning of day 16). Since Winter starts on day 21 on default settings, the player can easily survive the cold with just a full Beard and a **Thermal Stone**. The Beard, unlike **Clothes**, does not have durability and will provide insulation so long as he does not shave.
  - Wilson can still shave the Beard after four days (for one Beard Hair) and still have a full Beard by winter. It is also possible to shave after reaching a **long** Beard length (8 days), as while Wilson will not **start** winter with a full Beard, the first few days are more mild and will allow for time to grow.
  - In **Reign of Giants** and **Shipwrecked**, it is advised to shave at the beginning of Summer/Dry Season due to the Beard's slower rate at which Wilson cools.

## Infobox

- **Located**: In the [Pig City](Pig City)
- **Duration**: 5 days

> "Is there going to be a party?" - Webber

# Wendy

## Character Information
- **Image**: ![Wendy](Wendy.png)
- **Health**: 150
- **Hunger**: 150
- **Sanity**: 200
- **Damage Multiplier**: 0.75x
- **Sanity Multiplier**: -0.75x
- **Starting Item**: ![Abigail's Flower](Abigail%20Flower.png) - Abigail's Flower
- **Spawn Code**: `"wendy"`

## Special Powers
Wendy's special power is her ability to summon her dead twin sister, [Abigail]. Wendy starts with a wilted [Abigail's Flower] in her inventory, which blooms in roughly 2-4 full days, at which point she will be able to summon Abigail.

When Abigail's Flower has bloomed, it can be placed on the ground to prepare the summoning. The summoning requires the death of a [Mob] near the Flower. This includes Wendy herself but excludes any captured Mobs "murdered" through the inventory (single player only). Summoning Abigail will cost 50 [sanity] to Wendy.

![Wendy and Abigail](Wendy%20and%20Abigail.jpg)

Abigail follows Wendy and will attack Mobs that either attack Wendy or that Wendy herself attacks. Abigail cannot hurt Wendy, and normally doesn't attack any allies, such as [Chester], unless Wendy herself attacks them first. Abigail will always move away from Wendy when she comes too close. Abigail's attack damages all mobs in range at the same time, which makes Wendy exceptionally strong against groups of mobs like [Spiders] and [Bees] as Abigail can keep stunning them to keep them from attacking back.

Abigail's Flower will be dropped on the ground when Abigail is killed. It will be completely wilted and it will have to bloom before it can be used again.

Another special power Wendy has is that she suffers 25% less Sanity drain from Darkness and from being near insanity auras. The effect only extends to those two cases though, meaning that other things that drain Sanity (e.g. [Rain], [Dark Sword], [Monster Meat] etc.) will drain it at the same rate as other Characters (except [Walani]).

## Disadvantage
Wendy's attacks are 25% weaker than most other Characters' in order to balance out the ability to summon Abigail, and the lowered Sanity drain. For example, Wendy needs two attacks to kill a [Rabbit] with the [Boomerang] or a [Tool]. As such, hunting certain Mobs can be much more difficult whilst playing Wendy as she deals less damage by herself. Attacking stronger mobs without Abigail is not advised.

## Downloadable Content
In the [Shipwrecked] DLC, Abigail is immune to [Poison], making her useful when fighting venomous enemies. She also can float over water making her able to follow Wendy between islands, unlike most other [Followers].

## Tips
* Early on the easiest way to summon Abigail is to kill a Butterfly, which will die in 1 hit even when Wendy is unarmed. Alternatively the Flower can be dropped near a [Spider Den] that also has a [Pig House] nearby. Getting the [Pig] and [Spiders] to fight each other will ensure Abigail is summoned from the casualties.
* Abigail won't keep fighting Mobs forever and sometimes needs to be ordered to do so mid-fight. Keep an eye on the battle so to keep her focused on the task.
* Since she can outrun [Rabbits], Abigail is a source of easy [Morsels].
* In SW she can also be used to easily kill [Crabbits] and [Jellyfish]es.
* Abigail is at her strongest during Winter and Hurricane Season (in SW) since days are shorter and she deals bonus damage as the sky darkens. Leave any unfinished fights against neutral foes ([Treeguard]s, [Spider Queen]s, etc.) for this season.
* Although it is always dark in [Caves], there's a day-night system in place, meaning Abigail will not always do 40 damage per hit. In the [Ruins] though it's always considered Night.
* Abigail can tank and damage [Pengull]s rather easily, and can take the full camp with Wendy's help at Dusk without too much risk. This means Wendy has a fairly reliable source of Food in the Winter.
* While Abigail is great against groups of weaker foes, fighting stronger Mobs will result in her death unless she's helped by Wendy. Great support weapons are the [Ice Staff] and [Fire Staff]. The Ice

## Behavior
The Ancient Herald is a pseudo-hostile Boss Monster in Don't Starve: Hamlet. It spawns indefinitely during the Aporkalypse.

Upon death, it drops 5 Dark Tatters, 2 Nightmare Fuel, and a Blueprint for the Vortex Cloak.

The Ancient Herald will rise from the ground somewhere on the player's screen every ⅓ to 1 in-game days once the Aporkalypse begins. When the spawn timer counts down to 0, if an Ancient Herald is 5 tiles or less away from the player, a new one would not spawn. It will slowly pursue the player, losing interest if the player is 8 tiles away from it or further.

It attacks by diving into the ground, emitting a shock wave that destroys structures and damages nearby enemies, setting them on fire similar to the Iron Hulk Head or Leg. In addition, when fighting the player, it will cast an incantation every 15 seconds, summoning various creatures and attacks to help it. It will not summon any if there are 12 or more summons in a 5 tile radius around the player.

Possible summons include:
- 4 to 6 Ancient Spirits.
- 2 to 4 Nightmare Creatures.
- 1 to 4 Dragoon Eggs, that leave Lava Pools.
- 5 to 20 Poison Dartfrogs in a circle around the player.

## Hunting
The easiest and quickest way to defeat this boss is to wear armor in both the torso and head slot and attack it until it is dead. Due to its relatively low hp it will most likely only summon one wave of creatures before dying unless the player is playing as a character with a damage penalty such as Wendy or Wes.

## Trivia
- The appearance of the Ancient Herald is similar to the one of the two ancients mentioned in Metheus Puzzles.
- The Ancient Herald's summons are references to some of the 10 Plagues of Egypt in the Book of Exodus; Ancient Spirits being death, Nightmare Creatures being darkness, Dragoon Eggs being a thunderstorm of hail and fire, and Poison Dartfrogs being a plague of frogs.

# Dry Season (also known as Volcano Season)

The **Dry Season** is one of the four **Seasons** in the **Shipwrecked** DLC. It is characterized by a yellow/orange tint, similar to **Summer** in the **Reign of Giants** DLC. By default, the first Dry Season begins on **day 58** and ends on **day 74**. During the Dry Season, nights are very short, and dusk starts long but becomes shorter in length as the season progresses.

## Key Features

- Within the first days of the season, areas that were **Flooded** during **Monsoon Season** begin to dry up.
- The temperatures soon rise to the point where **Overheating** becomes a major issue, especially during the middle of the season.
- Overheating is not as severe compared to the **Summer** season in the **Reign of Giants** DLC.
- Most plants like **Bamboo**, **Grass Tufts**, **Berry Bushes**, and even **Saplings** can wither, making them non-functional unless treated.
- This effect also extends to **Basic Farms** and **Improved farms**, **Limpet Rocks** can wither as well.

## Ocean Conditions

- During Dry Season, the ocean is calmer with fewer waves.
- The waves get less frequent towards the end of the season.
- Fishing with a **Trawl Net** during Dry Season will yield the greatest variety of catch, including a chance to obtain **Obsidian**.

## Volcanic Eruptions

The **Volcano** will start to erupt soon after the flooded areas have dried up completely. Tremors occur three times before each eruption, giving slightly more than half of a day to prepare. When the volcano erupts, **Dragoon Eggs** rain down from the sky, each briefly showing a shadow where it will land, targeting areas within and slightly beyond the player's view.

## Strategy

Since falling **Dragoon Eggs** tend to cause havoc, it is recommended to leave any established bases and retreat to a location with no or few combustible resources. The best places for this are barren landscapes and **Shallow Ocean**. Medium or Deep Ocean is recommended more during the middle of the season where overheating is a major problem and wetness can provide emergency cooldown.

The ashes that cover the screen during an eruption may hinder vision and make the shadows cast by the falling **Dragoon Eggs** harder to see. This makes places with darker turf, like **Magma Fields**, potentially dangerous places to ride out an eruption. Therefore, a sacrificial beach for volcanic eruptions may be needed.

It is also a good idea to wear **Armor** while dodging **Dragoon Eggs** on land. Wearing a **Log Suit** with maximum **Health** will allow any character to survive a direct hit. Combining a stronger armor with a helmet (such as a **Football Helmet**) will allow surviving multiple hits.

For eruptions happening at night, a **Campfire** or **Endothermic Fire** can be built for protection from **Charlie** and to be able to see the shadows of falling **Dragoon Eggs**. However, these can be destroyed if any eggs strike near them. While **Torch**es can be used, they do not provide a large light radius. Therefore, the best option is to use a **Bottle Lantern** or a **Miner Hat**.

Landing **Dragoon Eggs** will sometimes form **Lava Pools**, which provide light with a fairly large radius, allowing the light source to be unequipped to save their durability. **Obsidian Fire Pits** are another alternative for providing light during a night eruption as a fully fueled Obsidian Fire Pit provides light for a large area. However, this may be a bit risky, since if the player gets close to the fire pit, landing **Dragoon Eggs** can destroy the Obsidian Fire Pit, eliminating the light source.

If the **Volcano** has been found, another strategy is to prevent eruptions altogether by going inside and making offerings to the **Volcano Altar of Snackrifice**. Building a small base inside the Volcano and spending the duration of Dry season there can allow the player to survive, collect resources specific to the Volcano biome, and continuously make offerings of appeasement with relatively low effort. **Eggs** provide a fairly high appeasement value and can be obtained by feeding cooked **Monster Meat** to a **bird** in a **Birdcage**. **Monster Meat** can be obtained by killing **Dragoon**s inside the Volcano.

In the **dry season**, land-based food sources such as **Farms** or **Berry Bushes** become effectively unusable, preparing alternate sources such as trawl nets or fishing poles will be very advantageous. Alternatively, if you have a

# Earthquake

![Objects falling during an earthquake](Earthquaking.png)

**Quotes:**
- Wilson: "That doesn't sound good."
- Willow: "That sound probably doesn't mean good things."
- Wolfgang: "Ground is shake. Wolfgang hate shaking ground."
- Wendy: "The ground shakes. Will it swallow me whole?"
- WX78: "EARTH DESTABILIZING"
- Wickerbottom: "A tremor! At least magnitude seven on the Richter scale."
- Woodie: "The ground is heaving!"
- Maxwell: "That rumbling can't be good."
- Wagstaff: "Seismic activity! And I left my instruments at home."
- Wigfrid: "The wörld shudders!"
- Webber: "I don't think that was our tummy."
- Walani: "The ground is shaking."
- Warly: "That is not a comforting sound..."
- Woodlegs: "Th'world be belchin'."
- Wilba: "YON GROUND 'TIS GRUMBLY!"
- Wormwood: "Rumbles!"
- Wheeler: "The ground's moving! Take cover!"
- Winona: "Earthquake!"
- Wortox: "Shiver and shake, that's a quake!"
- Wurt: "Ground shaking!"
- Walter: "Did you feel that, Woby?"
- Wanda: "The timeline's collapsing! No, worse, it's the ground!"

An **Earthquake** is a naturally occurring event in **Cave**s and the **Ruins**. Earthquakes occur regularly and can even be induced by igniting **Gunpowder**s, **Slurtle Slime**s, **Slurtle Mound**s, **Snurtle**s, and **Slurtle**s; using a **Telelocator Staff** and attacking a **Big Tentacle**. Earthquakes cause **mineral** items to fall from the ceiling (making some items renewable), though around 75% are destroyed from shattering when they hit the ground. Each item that falls can be:
- **Rocks** or **Flint** with a 37.5% chance each,
- **Gold Nugget** or **Nitre** (or **Rabbit** or **Moleworm** RoG 24) with a 10% chance each (5% each RoG 24),
- **Red Gem** or **Blue Gem** or **Marble** with a 1.6% chance each.

Falling objects caused by Earthquakes deal 30 damage to players, **Mobs**, and **Walls**, but not **Boss Monsters**. When an Earthquake begins, the camera will shake and the character will give a warning before items start to fall. Each object creates a round shadow on the ground, indicating where it will land. A falling object will cause damage until it has shattered or stopped bouncing. These items can destroy walls and other structures over time. Falling debris will also break existing debris on the ground, such as **Rocks**, **Gems**, **Gold Nuggets**, **Nitre** and **Marble**.

**Splumonkey**s will return to their **Splumonkey Pod**s as an Earthquake begins. **Slurtle**s and **Snurtle**s will spawn from **Slurtle Mound**s after an Earthquake, to eat any minerals that have fallen.

Wearing armor will reduce the amount of damage taken from falling debris.

## Reign of Giants

In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, live **Rabbit**s and **Moleworm**s may fall during Earthquakes in their stunned form. If left uncollected, they will recover and behave as usual: the Rabbits will wander aimlessly (like when they lose their **Rabbit Hole** home), flee from the player and certain mobs, and sleep at night (on the surface's time). Moleworms will collect a maximum of 3 debris before wandering around. Unlike their surface counterpart, Moleworms will not create **Burrow**s in the caves, but will do so once they are brought to the surface.

Rabbits and Moleworms do not fall during the Ruins' Earthquakes; only minerals will fall.

Using an **Old Bell** will also cause Earthquakes.

## Don't Starve Together

In **Don't Starve Together**, earthquakes occur every 1 to 3 days. Explosions shorten the waiting time by an amount of seconds equal to the damage of the explosion (300s for Slurtle, 200s for Gunpowder, 50s for Slurtle Mound and Slurtle Slime, multiplied by the size of the stack).

An earthquake lasts between 10 and 15 seconds during

# Winter Foods

Winter Foods are exclusive Food items for the event Winter's Feast. They have a 20% chance to be dropped randomly by killed Animals and Monsters. Much like Halloween Candies, they do not perish over time, and restore up to 2 Health, 2 Sanity and 3 Hunger. As an exception, the Eternal Fruitcake will be rejected by any character upon attempting to eat it, making it only useful for feeding other creatures (e.g. Pigs, to obtain Manure). All Winter Foods stack up to 40. Gingerbread Cookies, Sugar Cookies, Candy Canes, Eternal Fruitcakes and Chocolate Log Cakes can also be used to decorate Winter's Feast Trees.

## Sleeping

{{Quote|I will allöw it a fair fight and wait 'til it wakes.|Wigfrid}}

**Sleeping** is an in-game state that most **Mobs** can enter. Most animals (such as **Beefalo**) sleep during night, while monsters (such as **Spider**s) sleep during day. Different Mobs have different sleep routines, and not all Mobs go to sleep by themselves. Mobs with a home (like Spiders or **Pig**s) will attempt to return home when they need to go to sleep. If left homeless, they will fall asleep on the spot at the time they usually sleep. The player can put Mobs to sleep by using a **Pan Flute** or **Sleep Dart**, or by eating a **Mandrake**. The **Life Giving Amulet** also has the benefit of automatically knocking out nearby mobs upon resurrection. Sleeping Mobs can be pushed around.

![Wes sleeping on a Straw Roll](Wes Fur Roll.jpg =230px)

Player sleeping is slightly different from the rest of the mobs, as in-game time is simply advanced while the player sleeps. The player can use a **Straw Roll**, **Fur Roll**, or **Tent** to skip the night, use a **Siesta Lean-to** to skip the day, or cook or eat a Mandrake to get knocked out. The player can also be knocked out until the next day if any Mob nearby eats a Mandrake.

**Wickerbottom** is the only character which is unable to sleep due to her insomnia. She still gets knocked out by cooking or eating a **Mandrake**, or being near a yawning **Bearger#Don't Starve Together|Bearger**.

### Sleeping mobs

The following Mobs can be put to sleep:

- **Ancient Guardian**
- **Baby Beefalo**
- **Batilisk**
- **Bearger**
- **Bee**
- **Beefalo**
- **Blue Hound**
- **Bunnyman**
- **Cave Spider**

### Downloadable Content

In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, the player can also use a **Siesta Lean-to** to skip to **Dusk**.

### Don't Starve Together

In **Don't Starve Together**, sleeping doesn't skip time and instead makes the character immune to **Charlie**'s attacks and gradually restores Health and Sanity in exchange for Hunger over time. Sleeping can also be interrupted at will by doing any action or involuntarily by starving.

The **Bearger** will also yawn when awaken from sleep, putting all nearby mobs and players to sleep.

### Grogginess

Some effects apply a period of **Grogginess** to players. Players with grogginess are slowed down by 40% to 60% depending on the remaining time. The grogginess adds up every time an effect is applied.

When the total grogginess time exceeds 10 seconds, the player is put to sleep until the remaining time falls below 10 seconds. Some effects also apply a minimum amount of sleep time, if players is put to sleep by this kind of effect, the players will not naturally awake until the minimum sleep time has passed even if their grogginess already falls below 10 seconds. When players awake, if their grogginess time is less then 10 seconds, it will be set to 10 seconds. Eating a **Mushy Cake** increases the sleep threshold from 10 to 33.3 seconds.

# Glow Berry

![Glow Berry](Glow Berry.png)

A **Glow Berry** (not to be confused with a **Lesser Glow Berry**) is the glowing lure of a **Depths Worm**, dropped as loot upon its **death**. When eaten, it restores 11 **HP** and 25 **Hunger** but reduces **Sanity** by 10.

A Glow Berry will also cause any creature that consumes it, including **Bunnymen**, **Pigs**, **Splumonkeys**, **Prime Apes** and **Gobblers**, to glow. The intensity of the glowing light decreases over time and will extinguish 90 seconds after consumption. If dropped on the ground, it will glow, similar to a **Light Bulb**. It emits enough light to prevent an attack from **Charlie**.

# Skins in Don't Starve Together

Skins are a type of Curio in ''Don't Starve Together''. They are cosmetic items that players can use to customize their Characters. Players can choose their character's Skins when they join a server for the first time, or in-game by activating a Wardrobe. There are five different types of Skins (Body, Hands, Legs, Feet, and Heads). All of them are purely cosmetic and have no effect on gameplay besides visuals. They are stored in the Curio Cabinet in the Wardrobe section, where the player can view their collection and preview skins not yet obtained.

## Types of Skins

- **Head Skins**
- **Body Skins**
- **Hands Skins**
- **Legs Skins**
- **Feet Skins**

# Wilson's Ghost

![Ghost Wilson](Ghost_Wilson.png){ width=93 }

### Details about Wilson's Ghost
- **Health**: N/A
- **Special Ability**: Can haunt objects

> "Oooh oOooh. OoOOh?" - Ghost Player

## Ghost Players

**Ghost Players** or **Ghost Characters** appear whenever a player dies in **Don't Starve Together**. They can fly around and haunt objects. Ghost Players may resurrect themselves via **Touch Stones**, **Meat Effigies**, or **Life Giving Amulets**. Other players are able to resurrect them using a **Telltale Heart**. **Wanda** can also use **Second Chance Watch** to revive herself and other characters. They also emit just enough light to ward off **Charlie**.

### Game Modes

#### Survival Mode
In Survival Mode, if any players have died and become ghosts, a ghost icon will appear by all other players' **Sanity** meter and their Sanity will decrease by 3.3/min (0.055/sec) for every ghost. This penalty encourages the resurrection of fallen players. When all players have died and become ghosts, a 120-second timer will begin that will end the game and generate a new world (the timer will be reset back to 120 seconds if the server is shut down and then reconnected). If a Ghost Player revives (via Touch Stone for example) before the countdown ends, the world will continue.

#### Wilderness Mode
In Wilderness Mode, the player respawns at a random location on the map after being killed, so ghosts do not appear in this mode.

#### Endless Mode
In Endless Mode, the game will go on even when every player has become a ghost. Ghost Players will be able to revive at the **Florid Postern** for a maximum Health penalty. In addition, Ghost Players will not drain Sanity in this mode, unlike Survival mode.

## Haunting

Haunting is an action that can only be performed by Ghost Players. It has a variety of different effects, depending on the entity that is being haunted. Examples of haunting objects are moving **items** around, turning **Tree**s into **Treeguard**s, and turning **Flower**s into **Evil Flower**s. After being haunted, an entity cannot be haunted again for a few more seconds. Evil flowers can also be used to create **Nightmare Fuel**.

### Beneficial Effects

- **Suspicious Dirt Pile**: Suspicious tracks will be investigated.
- **Hound**: Hounds of kind types have a 50% chance of changing type; this will restore a hound's health to maximum, make it lose its loyalty, and cause it to panic after the transformation.
- **Mushrooms**: Mushrooms (in the ground) have a 25% chance of changing to another mushroom color.
- **Pig Torch**: Pig Torches will receive fuel and spawn a **Guardian Pig** if one is not already out.

### Harmful Effects

- Balloons will explode.
- **Ashes** will disappear.
- Dwarf Stars (produced by the Star Caller's Staff) will be extinguished.

### Neutral Effects

- **Abigail** will be angered briefly.
- **Beefalo** will attempt to spawn a baby after they are done panicking.

### Panic

These creatures will panic for a few seconds after being haunted. Panicking involves running around, pausing previous aggro. Some of the following mobs will run away from player ghosts, making them practically impossible to haunt.
- Beefalo (including babies)
- **Batilisk**
- **Butterfly**
- **Killer Bee**
- **Chester**
- **Clockwork Rook**, **Clockwork Knight**, **Clockwork Bishop**

# Rocky Turf
Rocky Turf is one of the **Turf** items, acquired by digging **Rockyland** tiles with a **Pitchfork**. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or it can be used as **Fire#Fuel|fuel**. It can also be used to craft **Cobblestones**, which are placeable **Roads**.

## Properties
- **Can Be Burned**: 1
- **Icon**: ![Rocky Turf](Rocky_Turf.png)
- **Image**: ![Rocky Turf Dropped](Rocky_Turf_Dropped.png)
- **Dropped By**:
  - **Rockyland** tiles (![Pitchfork](Pitchfork))
  - **Pinacle** tiles (![Pitchfork](Pitchfork))
- **Stack**: 10
- **Burn Time**: **File:Light_Sources_Filter.png|32px|link=Fuel#Fire Fuel** 45 sec.
- **Spawn Code**: "turf_rocky"

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: A chunk of ground.
- **Wendy**: Some ground.
- **Willow**: The ground is boring.
- **Wolfgang**: Step stones.
- **Wx78**: GROUND PARTS
- **Wickerbottom**: The ground. You step on it.
- **Woodie**: Some ground.
- **Maxwell**: Kinda rough.
- **Wagstaff**: Not especially good for planting.
- **Wigfrid**: A piece of the battlefield.
- **Webber**: Some pretty average earth.
- **Walani**: Rocky.
- **Warly**: It's like an ingredient for the ground.
- **Woodlegs**: Me ain't no ground lubber.
- **Wilba**: 'TIS GROUND
- **Wormwood**: Not dirt
- **Wheeler**: Do I really need to drag these rocks around with me?
- **Winona**: That's a chunk of rocky ground.
- **Wortox**: Floor or ceiling, depending on your perspective.
- **Wurt**: Ground bit.
- **Walter**: A patch of ground.
- **Wanda**: Why am I wasting time staring at the ground?
- **Choose**: Walani

## Usage
**Rocky Turf** cannot be planted with **Berry Bush**es, **Sapling**s, **Grass Tuft**s, **Spiky Bush**es, **Pine Cones**, and **Birchnut**s. **Lureplant|Eyeplants** cannot spawn on this Turf, so it is great for planting **Lureplant** farms while not spending any more resources than those used to craft the **Pitchfork**.

When placed on the **Surface World** and the area is large enough, **Crows** are the only **Birds** that will spawn and land on these turfs.

In **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**, floods can start on this turf.

## Crafting
### Recipe
- **Item 1**: Rocky Turf
- **Item 2**: Boards
- **Result**: Cobblestones
- **Science 2**: yes

## Weight

Weight is a characteristic of some Mobs exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. Only **Vegetables**, **Ocean Fishes**, **Freshwater Fish**, **Live Eel**, **Wobster** and **Lunar Wobster** have weights.

## Fishes

Weight of fish can be measured with **Pocket Scale** and **Fish Scale-O-Matic**. The weight of a fish is chosen at random from the range of values possible for its species.

Weights of Ocean Fishes are evenly distributed:
\[ weight = random \times (max\_weight - min\_weight) + min\_weight \]

Weights of Wobster and Lunar Wobster are concentrated towards the minimum:
\[ weight = random^3 \times (max\_weight - min\_weight) + min\_weight \]

Weights of Freshwater Fish and Live Eel are concentrated towards the average:
\[ weight = ((2 \times random - 1)^3 - 1) \times (max\_weight - min\_weight) + min\_weight \]

The **Crabby Hermit** accepts only fish that weigh more than 70% of the maximum weight for their type. The **Heavy Weighted Lure** attracts only fish that weigh more than 80% of the maximum weight for their type.

| Fish             | Name             | Min weight  | Max weight  | Crabby Hermit threshold | Heavy Weighted Lure threshold |
