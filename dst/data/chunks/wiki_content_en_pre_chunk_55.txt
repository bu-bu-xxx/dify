Parasitic Shadelings are creatures that spawn after the fight with the Nightmare Werepig is initiated. They can only be attacked once the player reaches their insanity threshold. They must be killed in order to properly start the boss fight with the Nightmare Werepig. Unlike other Shadow Creatures, they do not attack the player.

## Tips

To quickly go insane and then go sane again, the Nightmare Amulet can be used.

## Behavior

No-Eyed Deer are passive, seasonal Mobs exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. They spawn near the beginning of **Autumn** in **Deciduous Forests** or **Mosaic** Biomes and are always found in groups of 6 to 9. Past the beginning of **Winter** they will grow one of the 3 variations of **Deer Antlers**. They will, however, despawn around the end of the season unless they are near a player's base. Killing one adds 4 points to the player's naughtiness level, which can cause **Krampus** to appear.

No-Eyed Deer will spawn 3–5 days into Autumn. They will only spawn in **Deciduous Forests** or **Mosaic Biomes** at fixed spawn locations, similarly to the **Loot Stash**. They will always spawn as a group away from all players. The herd always stays together and all animals move exactly in the same direction.

As Winter starts, the No-Eyed Deer will start migrating, growing their antlers after about 1 **Day**. If the No-Eyed Deer collides with an object such as a **Tree**, the antler will break off. Within 2 days before or after the end of Winter, No-Eyed Deer will despawn unless they are within 1.5 screens (7.5 **Pitchfork** tiles) of at least 10 player **Structures** or **Walls**.

No-Eyed Deer will not run away from the player if approached but will be startled. If attacked, they will flee.

Despite being a herd animal like **Beefalo** and **Volt Goats**, they do not appear to breed.

## Trivia

- The name "No-Eyed Deer" can be interpreted as a pun on the phrases "doe-eyed" and "no idea". It could also be a reference to the fable, **The One-Eyed Deer**.
- No-Eyed Deer were added in the **Herd Mentality** update. Before the **Winter's Feast** update, they

# Guide: Effectively Using Woodie's Beaver Form in Don't Starve

This guide explains how to effectively use Woodie's beaver form in the game Don't Starve. Please note that significant changes in Don't Starve Together have made some strategies impossible.

## Avoiding Beaver Form
To avoid turning into a beaver by cutting too much wood, prepare a large tree farm and stockpile sanity-gaining materials and clothing. Healing Salves and Poultices are also useful in maintaining sanity levels between 120-200 at all times.

## Full Moon Strategy
During the full moon, cut down all fully grown trees until a Treeguard spawns. Maintain beaver form until the second full moon ends, which takes 2-3 days. Once the curse wears off, kill as many Beardlings as possible and make Meatballs from the Monster Meat and Berries. This also helps farm Beard Hair and Nightmare Fuel for crafting later.

## The Curse
Woodie transforms into a Werebeaver if he chops down too many trees in a short time or during a full moon, regardless of the axe used. In this form, the Map is unavailable, and the HUD is replaced by the Log Meter.

### Werebeaver Abilities
- Chops down Trees
- Digs plants
- Mines Rocks
- Demolishes Structures
- Fights mobs

The attack strength is equivalent to the normal damage of a Tentacle Spike (51). The Werebeaver has unlimited night vision and is immune to Charlie. The Log Meter acts as both health and hunger, decaying at a rate of 2 points every 2.5 seconds.

## Don't Starve Together
Woodie now has three different wereforms: Werebeaver, Weregoose, and Weremoose. Transformation can occur through consuming monster food, crafting idols, or during a full moon.

### Werebeaver Food
Here is a table of items that can be consumed to maintain the Log Meter:

| Item | Log Meter Increase |
| --- | --- |
| Living Log | +50 LM |
| Boards | +15 LM |
| Logs | +10 LM |
| Saplings | +10 LM |
| Berry Bush | +10 LM |
| Spiky Bush | +10 LM |
| Grass Tuft | +10 LM |
| Twigs | +5 LM |
| Pine Cones | +2 LM |
| Cut Grass | +1 LM |

## Werebeaver Tips
- Destroy Tier 3 Spider Dens for Silk and Spider Eggs.
- Attempt to kill the Spider Queen for drops.
- Kill Tentacles in the Marsh for Tentacle Spike and Tentacle Spot drops.
- Kill Treeguards and Clockwork enemies.
- Mine Boulders to save on Pickaxes.
- Survive Winter more easily.
- Dig up graves without losing sanity.
- Kill Beefalos for Wool and Horn.
- Destroy Pig Houses for Boards and Cut Stone.

## Gaining More Items
In Werebeaver form, you can demolish rocks, marble pillars, and graves to loot later as Woodie. Leave at least one intact gold mine or marble pillar to locate your loots easily.

## Other Gained Materials
Killing Treeguards and Beardlings will give you Living Logs, Monster Meat, Beard Hair, and Nightmare Fuel. Cutting down trees will provide logs and pine cones for new farms.

## When Turning Back into Woodie
When your Log Meter hits 0, you will become Woodie again with your sanity, hunger, and health all at 50. Prepare with Pumpkin Cookies or a "First Aid Kit" backpack.

## In An Emergency
If you are without armor or a weapon and are going to be attacked, chop down lots of trees until you turn into the werebeaver to increase your chances of survival.

**Scales** are a rare item in **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants**. They are dropped by the Summer Giant, **Dragonfly**. Scales are used to craft fire-resistant items: the **Scalemail**, which grants wearer immunity to fire damage, and the fire-proof container, the **Scaled Chest**.

# Combat Armor Guide in Don't Starve

Combat is a main feature in **Don't Starve**. Although Armor is a key in combat, the armor with the highest absorption isn't always the best choice and depends on the situation. This guide will show when to use each piece of armor, and why.

## Grass Suit
**Main Article: [Grass Suit]**

### Overview
Let's start with the weakest and cheapest piece: The Grass Suit.

![Grass_Suit](Grass_Suit.png "Grass Suit")

Though completely useless late-game, it's not worthless. Low durability and absorption means it's not a good idea to take it in a heavy fight.

### Why use it?
Due to its extremely low cost, it works well against weak and/or lonely mobs. It's also useful when the player is desperate for armor and doesn't have the materials to make a higher tier armor. Usually neglected, the Grass Suit proves useful in certain early-game situations.

### When to use it?
It works well against weak, lonely, or stun-lockable mobs (such as a lonely [Spider]), while it doesn't prevent a lot of damage, it can get the job done. It can also be used as a last resort when one's main armor is running low and the player is in a dangerous place such as the [Ruins].

## Log Suit
**Main Article: [Log Suit]**

### Overview
The most commonly used piece of armor: The Log Suit.

![Log_Suit](Log_Suit.png "Log Suit")

Many players - from beginners to experts - like using the Log Suit due to its relatively low cost and high absorption. Its overall properties make it one of the most common and useful pieces of armor.

### Why use it?
Because it has a relatively low cost, high absorption, and is prototyped with the [Science Machine], the Log Suit is a good early and late game armor.

### When to use it?
It's far better to pair it with a [Football Helmet] once one builds an [Alchemy Engine], but until then, it's acceptable to use it by itself since dangers are far easier to deal with early on.

## Marble Suit
**Main Article: [Marble Suit]**

### Overview
The armor for tanking: The Marble Suit.

![Marble_Suit](Marble_Suit.png "Marble Suit")

When kiting is not an available option, the Marble Suit is a viable option. It is tied with having the highest absorption of any craftable piece of armor, but this suit also has a penalty: 30% slower movement speed.

### Why use it?
Some mobs are hard to kite; in this case, the Marble Suit offers the highest absorption at the cost of 30% of the character's movement speed. If the player is unable to kite their target, or the enemy cannot be kited, the Marble Suit is a viable choice.

### When to use it?
Due to its penalty, it's advised to use the Marble Suit when kiting is not an option, since kiting mobs can save the player some resources (Such as spare armor and healing items).

## Football Helmet
**Main Article: [Football Helmet]**

### Overview
![Football_Helmet](Football_Helmet.png "Football Helmet")

Requiring an Alchemy Engine to prototype and having the same durability and absorption of the Log Suit, the Football Helmet proves helpful when a Backpack and armor are required at the same time. It can also be equipped with another piece of armor for extra protection.

### Why use it?
While technically more expensive than its chest counterpart, the Log Suit, it takes up the head slot, which means a Backpack can be equipped along with it.

### When to use it?
Pairing it with a chest armor increases the absorption, and thus, it can be used in tandem with another piece to have even more protection. It can also be used when a Backpack is required as well.

## Thulecite Suit
**Main Article: [Thulecite Suit]**

### Overview
![Thulecite_Suit](Thulecite_Suit.png "Thulecite Suit")

Hard to acquire, non-renewable (except in DST, through regeneration of the Ruins), and featuring the highest durability and the second highest absorption makes this armor rather difficult to place as to when to use it. It has no penalties and regenerates Sanity by 3.3/min - as much as a [Dapper Vest].

### Why use it?
Due to its high durability and absorption, the Thulecite Suit proves to be one of the best late-game pieces of armor. However, it is non-renewable (Barely renewable in DST).

### When to use it?
Because it is non-re

# Moose/Goose Egg

## Description
The **Moose/Goose Egg** is an object in **Don't Starve Together**. During **Spring**, a number of **Moose/Goose** will appear and lay an egg. If the Moose/Goose Egg is left alone, it will hatch after 2 days and spawn 5 **Mosling**s. The egg can also be hammered 4 times to break, but each hit will strike the player with 10 electricity damage. This damage can be avoided by wearing Lightning proof **Clothes** or using a **Weather Pain**.

When **Summer** arrives, all the Moose/Goose and Moslings will fly away, even in combat.

## Trivia
- The egg will randomly alternate between being called a "Moose Egg" and a "Goose Egg".

## Bugs
- Occasionally, the Moose/Goose will spawn, and no egg will spawn, even if left alone for days.
- Spawning in this item spawns an empty nest. To fix this, you need to add the 'InitEgg()' variable to the end. Eg: 'c_spawn("mooseegg"):InitEgg()'
- Occasionally a Moose/Goose egg that did not hatch while the Moose/Goose was still alive will remain in place, unhatched through all the seasons. Using wormholes, moving many screens away or relogging will not cause the egg to hatch or despawn.
- Dying by hammering the egg will result in the morgue listing the death as "Shenanigans".

# Ancient Pig Ruins Exploration Guide

The Ancient Pig Ruins are found in Hamlet worlds and can be located in any biome except the Pig City. These ruins often contain valuable loot, such as gems, gold, and relics. However, they can also be full of traps. This guide will teach you how to successfully explore the ruins.

## Gather Necessary Resources

Before you even begin to explore the ruins, you will need adequate tools to do so. Here's what you need to gather:

- Source some iron from the Painted biome by finding it on the ground, looting Thunderbird nests, and destroying Gnat Mounds.
- Gather a few reeds from the swamp.
- Gather some cork from Claw Palm Trees, flint from boulders and stalagmites, and twigs and grass from saplings and tall grass.
- Collect some oincs and kill some guard pigs if you want some better items (explained in the next section).

## Make the Tools

With your resources in hand, proceed to make the following items:

- A machete, for hacking through vines.
- A spear or halberd, to defend yourself.
- A ball pein hammer, for looting relics and gold.
- A few disarming tools, for disarming traps.
- Some armour, if you wish for protection from scorpions, snakes, and batilisks.
- A cork candle hat, to provide light while keeping your hands free. If you have enough oincs, you could replace the cork candle hat with a miner hat, which can be bought from Pig and Piglet's General Store for 20 oincs.
- Bring some relatively cheap items with you as well, such as twigs or rocks, for weighting down pressure plates.

## Speedrun the Ruins

If you do not wish for loot from the ruins and simply wish to quickly travel to another island, you may want to ignore the loot and simply get through as fast as you can. If this is what you wish to accomplish, simply explore as many rooms as you can until you find the other exit. Remember to look out though, as dart traps, scorpions, and spikes can easily put an end to you. Killing enemy mobs is not necessary, although you may want to if they are bothering you. Look out for pressure plates, and only use disarming tools unless absolutely necessary.

## Scorerun the Ruins

If you wish to journey to the ruins for valuable relics and rare gems, this method is for you. Make plenty of disarming tools, and disarm all the dart traps in every room before you start to chisel or take items. Kill all of the hostile mobs in each room, as you will be spending quite some time there and journeying back through, unless this room is a dead end. Think of each room as a puzzle, with its pressure plates, spikes, and darts, and think every solution through before you take action. Place a few chests at the entrance to the ruins, in case your inventory gets full and you need to unload.

## Additional Tools

There are many other tools that can be used for exploring the ruins, such as guard contracts, stalking sticks, and shears. Although unnecessary, these tools can make exploring the ruins much easier. However, the methods listed above will certainly be enough if you prepare everything and keep your wits about you.

# Repelling Hounds: Advanced Tips

Repelling hounds gets increasingly difficult the longer one survives, and here are some tips to hold them back.

## Technique 1: Panic Room

This is a **structure** often referred to as a **Deathtrap**. This is a large structure made out of **Walls** (preferably Stone, as they are non-flammable) and filled with **Tooth Traps** or **Bee Mines** (preferably Tooth Traps). It should have a **Fire Pit** in case you are fighting the hounds in winter or at night. You can try to kite them, but you can tank them best inside your panic room. If your room is big and filled with traps, most of the hounds should take a lot of damage or even die.

## Technique 2: Creature Protection

Hounds will attack EVERYTHING, and this can be used to your advantage by distracting them with other mobs.

Note that ALL of the strategies listed below involving mobs not normally hostile to Hounds (ie not Pigs or Bunnymen) are made MUCH easier with a **Bush Hat** if used correctly. By hiding **before the growling signalling Hound waves ends**, the first wave of hounds will not aggro onto you and instead run around aimlessly before eventually finding something else to target.

- **Pig Village**: Lure a pack of hounds to a **Pig Village**, and watch the hounds meet their defeat. However, this tactic is not the best for obtaining **Monster Meat** as the pigs will eat any monster meat you don’t pick up first, and might even transform into a **Werepig** if you are not careful. Also, Pigs will retreat into their houses at night, making this strategy ineffective for Dusk- and Night-time hound waves.

- **Beefalo**: Move far away from the hounds (or hide with a Bush Hat), and they will eventually attack the Beefalo. A moderately sized herd of Beefalo will usually be able to beat the Hounds handily, only losing if the herd happens to be at low health. This is even easier when the Beefalo are in heat during Spring, as they will instantly aggro on the hounds (though they might also attack you if you don’t have a **Beefalo Hat**). Unlike with pigs, this can be done at Dusk, giving you a small bit of time to continue or maybe pick up some loot. Just make sure you don't leave it too late.

- **Pengulls**: During winter, **Pengulls** can be used to repel hounds to great effect due to their swarm tactics and large flock size. Run around a bunch or use a Bush Hat to get one of the Hounds to attack a Pengull, provoking the entire flock to attack and eventually leading to a massive brawl between Hounds and Pengulls. A moderately large flock of Pengulls will usually be able to deal with the Hounds (although the same canot be said for smaller flocks). This is notably an extremely profitable way to deal with Hounds, as you will get a large amount of **Morsels**, **Drumsticks**, **Jet Feathers**, **Eggs**, **Monster Meat** and **Hound’s Teeth** from all the dead mobs. Even better, whichever side wins will usually be sufficiently weakened that the player can easily finish off the last few stragglers by themself.

- **Bees**: You can do exactly the same with **Bees**, however this is the hardest way to do it if there’s only 1 or 2 **Beehives** nearby. Preferably, get a Hound to attack a Bee Hive so that Killer Bees will attack the hounds. Alternatively, you can lead a bunch of Hounds to a **Killer Bee Hive**, getting the hounds killed in a much smaller amount of time. Be cautious though as the Killer Bees will aggro on you as well once the hounds are dead.

- **Bunnymen and Rabbit Hutches**: You can also lead hounds to Rabbit Hutches to have Bunnymen attack the hounds if you have some built. This combos well with Pig Houses as they will allow for hound protection at any hour.

- **Houndius Shootius**: Also you can lead a few hounds to a **Houndius Shootius**. However, they are very difficult to craft, and aren’t even guaranteed to beat a hound wave by themself without dying and thereby losing the precious resources used to create one.

Thanks for reading my guide to advanced hound repelling! This guide was made by DragonMaster9240, a huge Don't Starve fan.

The Moonblind Crow is a mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together and introduced in the Eye of the Storm beta.

They will land in flocks alongside Misshapen Birds inside of Moonstorms while Wagstaff is containing the storm. They will slowly move toward the Restrained Static container and attempt to attack it if within range. Regardless of if the containment succeeds or not all Moonblind Crows that spawned will remain and wander the area until they are killed.

Moonblind Crows can be caught using a Trap or a Bird Trap. They can then be placed into a Birdcage or murdered for one Rot.

If placed in a Birdcage, the Moonblind Crow will drop Rot instead of Crop Seeds from being fed a raw Fruit or Vegetable, and will drop a Rotten Egg instead of an Egg if fed Meats. A Moonblind Crow inside a Birdcage does not sleep at night during a Full Moon.

| Trap | Effect | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Sanity Meter | Raises or lowers the player's Sanity | -20 to +20 | |
| Health Meter | Raises or lowers the player's Health | 0 to +20 | Cannot kill the player |
| Hunger Meter | Raises or lowers the player's Hunger | -20 to +20 | |
| Backpack | Raises or lowers the durability or spoilage of a random item in the player's Inventory | -20% to +20% | May lead to unorthodox percentages on tools or armor |

# Large Ornate Chest

![Large Ornate Chest](Large Ornate Chest.png)

The Large Ornate Chest spawns when the Ancient Guardian is killed. This chest contains substantially more loot than its smaller counterpart, with 7-9 of the items guaranteed to be chosen. There will always be an Ancient Key in the Large Ornate Chest in Don't Starve Together. The Large Ornate Chests cannot be destroyed.

## Contents

| Items(s) | Chance | Durability (%) | Quantity |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Thulecite Crown / Thulecite Suit / Thulecite Club | 77% | 100 | 1 |
| Magiluminescence / The Lazy Forager | 77% | 100 | 1 |
| The Lazy Explorer / Star Caller's Staff | 77% | 100 | 1 |
| Thulecite | 77% | N/A | 8-14 |
| Thulecite Fragments | 77% | N/A | 12-36 |
| Green Gem | 77% | N/A | 2-3 |
| Yellow Gem | 77% | N/A | 2-4 |
| Orange Gem | 77% | N/A | 2-4 |
| Gears | 77% | N/A | 3-6 |
| Ancient Key | 100% | N/A | N/A |

## Trivia

- The name "pandoraschest" is a reference to the Greek myth of Pandora's box, a box that contained all the evils in the world. The fact that the chest can spawn Terrorbeaks and Dangling Depth Dwellers when opened is likely a reference to this.
- In DST, the Large Ornate Chest's drops were improved in the March 2022 QoL update.

# Ice Sheet

**Exclusivity:** Don't Starve Together

**Biome Infobox:**
- **Cooldown:** 20 days
- **Image:** ![Ice Sheet](Ice Sheet.png)
- **Abundant:**
  - ![Water Mini Glacier](32x32.png)
  - ![Sea Stack](24x24.png)
- **Rare:**
  - ![Ice Fishing Hole](32x32.png)
- **Turf:**
  - ![Ice Floe](50x50.png)

## Description
The **Ice Sheet** is a [Biome](Biomes) consisting of an island and a small area of Ocean near the island with abundant [Mini Glacier](Mini Glacier/DST)s all year around. The island has an [Ice Floe], so if the player moves too fast, they may slip and fall. On the island there is an [Ice Fishing Hole] that the player can fish in to spawn the [Frostjaw].

The size of the ice surface will grow bigger in [Winter], thereby creating an island with a diameter of 11 turf vertically/horizontally and 6 turf diagonally. In [Spring] it will slowly collapse until the island becomes 5 turf vertically/horizontally and 3 turf diagonally.

After defeating the Frostjaw, the island will start slowly collapsing from the edges. Also all the Mini Glacier will dissolve. After some time, the Ice Sheet biome (island and a small area of water around) will disappear. After 20 days the biome will respawn in a random place in the world. If it spawns in an area that is revealed on the map, the player can spot it on the map.

## Tips for Prototype
- In Winter, once the player starts to fight Frostjaw, the island will begin to collapse after some time, making the island smaller and smaller. The player should be careful to not jump on the [Ice Boat], else they may [Drowning](drown).

## Trivia
- The Ice Sheet was introduced in the ''[Skill Spotlight Update#Wigfrid & Willow|Skill Spotlight: Wigfrid & Willow]'' update.

# What will be needed:
- Any [Weapon] ([Spear] or [Tentacle Spike] is best)
- [Log Suit] or [Football Helmet] (optional but recommended)
- [Bird traps]
- [Spider Eggs]
- [Honey] or [Bee Boxes] (optional)

# Steps:
1. Locate a [Pig Village] with a [Pig King].
2. Plant Spider Eggs near Pig Village.
3. Startle [Spiders], and let the [Pigs] kill them. Loot [Meat], [Pig Skin], [Monster Meat], [Silk], and [Spider Gland]s as quickly as possible.
4. Give the collected Meat to the Pig King to receive [Gold Nuggets].
5. Feed the collected Monster Meat to the Pigs. They will turn into [Werepigs] and fight the Pigs. 
6. Collect the Meat and give it to the Pig King.
7. Use the collected [Silk] to craft [Bird Traps] and hunt [Birds].
8. Give the [Morsel]s to the Pig King, and collect Gold Nuggets.

# Notes:
- If the player has a Honey Farm, one may take the [Honey] and [Monster Meat], and cook them both in the [Crock Pot] to make [Honey Nuggets].
- Silk is required for many useful [Survival] [Items]; the player will be able to get the Silk from Spiders killed.
- As of the [Reap What You Sow DST update]: Caged Birds will now eat raw monster meat

# Alternative Method:
Build a [birdcage], feed the [Bird] [Monster Meat]. This will yield one [Egg]. The Egg can be given the Pig King in exchange for one [Gold Nugget]. If the [Monster Meat] from [Hounds] isn't enough, additional [Monster Meat] can be obtained in various ways. One of the easiest ways is roaming the [Marsh]es and cleaning up after battles between [Tentacle]s, [Merm]s and [Spider]s (this can easily be combined with collecting [Reeds] and [Tentacle Spike]s).

# Cave Fishing Method:
In the caves you can fish for [Eel|eels], which are valued at 5 gold from Pig King. Once you have gathered the desired amount of eels you may use [Bundling Wrap] to prevent them from spoiling, and return to the surface.

# Cave/Ruins Clockwork Method:
[Broken Clockworks] are scattered heavily throughout the ruins and caves underground when hit with a [hammer] they have a chance to drop [Trinkets|Melty Marbles] (x4) and [Trinkets|Frazzled Wires] (x5). These trinkets can be carried in stacks of 20 and traded to the pig king for gold.

# Wonkey

## Character Information
- **Health**: 125
- **Hunger**: 175
- **Sanity**: 100
- **Favorite Food**: ![Cave Banana]({{pic32|Cave Banana}})
- **Spawn Code**: `wonkey`
- **Image**: ![Wonkey DST.png]({{Wonkey DST.png}})

Wonkey, similar to [[Wilbur]] from ''[[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]]'', has the ability to run after walking continuously for 3 seconds. While running its base speed is increased to 8 (the average value for most characters is 6), which is 33% faster than normal.

### Advantages
- Wonkey has permanent right of passage on the Moon Quay island, and will not be harassed by the Powder Monkeys on the island.
- [[Prime Mate|Prime Mates]] will not attack Wonkey when it steps on their boat.
- The curse can be removed by giving Bananas to the Queen of Moon Quay, who will remove 4 Accursed Trinkets from the player's inventory for each Banana. Wonkey will transform back into the original character when the player has 0 Accursed Trinkets, but will still have right of passage on the Moon Quay for half a day as a result of giving Bananas to the Queen.
- The Curse can be removed by death, dropping all trinkets in the process, so one should keep that in mind when attempting to retrieve the items that were dropped.

### Disadvantages
- As Wonkey, [[Pig|Pigmen]] and [[Bunnyman|Bunnymen]] will become hostile; [[Catcoon|Catcoons]], however, will not.
- Although the player can now understand Powder Monkeys and the Queen of Moon Quay, dialogue from other mobs such as Pigmen, Bunnymen, the [[Crabby Hermit]], and even the [[Reanimated Skeleton#Ancient_Fuelweaver|Ancient Fuelweaver]] will turn into incomprehensible gibberish.
- Wonkey has greater speed while running, but its base speed is slower, with a penalty of -0.5 (5.5 total speed without additional modifiers, which is about 8.3% slower than normal). This presents a disadvantage when frequent stops are made while moving, since 3 seconds of movement are required before starting to run. While running, hunger drains 33% faster than normal. Even so, it does arrive at its destination 33% sooner than a normal character, covering the same ground for the same hunger cost.
- If a player was playing as [[Wes]] before the transformation, they would still not be able to talk.

## Prototype Tips
* Despite being a curse and lacking in unique perks, Wonkey will also remove the downsides of the player's original character, allowing multiple interactions that would otherwise be impossible:
  * [[Wigfrid]] will be able to eat non-Meat food
  * [[Wurt]] will be able to eat Meat food and trade with the [[Pig King]] (although ordinary pigs will remain hostile)
  * [[Wormwood]] and [[Wanda]] can heal normally
  * [[Warly]] And [[Wortox]] can eat all foods without penalty
  * Wanda’s age will be converted into health, at a 0.4 age to 1 health conversion rate, and vice versa when transforming back
  * [[Wickerbottom]] can sleep, allowing her to get gifts at the Winter Feast Tree

# Exclusivity: Hamlet

## Guide on Hamlet Pig Civilization Economy

This guide covers the Hamlet pig civilization economy, which pigs to sell to and which ones to avoid, their trades, and how to exploit it all for hundreds of Oincs. A Tier List will be provided at the end, and the tiering will be based on usefulness throughout the game, Oinc to item ratio, trading item accessibility, and the daily limit.

![Collector Pig](Pig Collector.png "The Collector Pig"){: height="1x1px} 

### Collector Pig
![Collector Pig](Pig Collector.png "Collector Pig"){: height="2x2px} 
The Collector Pig trades one Stinger, Silk, Mosquito Sack, Chitin, Flytrap Stalk, Venom Glands, Spider Gland, Lotus Flower, and any Trinket for 3 Oincs with no daily limit. You can find him in the Palace Town at the 'The Sty' Oddities Emporium.

#### Judgement: Collector Pig
This trader is amazing. Most of the items he takes don't have a lot of uses or are very easy to find, with the exception of the Flytrap Stalk, Lotus Flower, and maybe the Spider Glands if you're in Wormwood. So you'll probably have a lot of these. The collector pig gives 3 Oincs per trade, turning your almost useless items into lots of Oincs. I'd recommend building a house for them near your base for easy money.

**Pros and Cons: Collector Pig**
- Great Oinc to Item Value (Pro)
- Trades for a wide variety of items (Pro)
- Trades for almost useless items and/or very common items (Pro)

### Banker Pig
The Banker Pig trades one Gem of any color except purple for 10 Oincs as a Tenpiece Oinc. You can find him at any pig civilization in Pigg and Piglet's General Store and Swinesbury Mineral Exchange.

#### Judgement: Banker Pig
Do not use him unless desperate for Oincs. You don't find many gems in the early game until you find the Pinacle with the BFB, But you'll probably get one Blue gem, one Red gem, and one Purple gem. You can't sell him the Purple gem and you should probably save the Red and Blue gems for the Smelter and Sprinkler, respectively. You'd normally have quite a few gems by the 1st in-game year, but you'll already have much better sources of Oincs. But he can buy gems when you don't need them.

**Pros and Cons: Banker Pig**
- Decent Oinc to Gem ratio (Pro)
- Gems are sort of easily accessible in late game (Pro)
- You'd have a MUCH better source of Oincs in late game (Con)
- You'd constantly use gems for Life Giving Amulets, Ice Staves, and Magnifying Gasses due to their short lives (Con)
- Buys gems that don't have a use (Pro) 

### Beautician Pig
The Beautician Pig trades any Feather except for Down Feathers once a day for 2 Oincs. You can find her at any pig civilization in the Curly Tails Mud Spa.

#### Judgement: Beautician Pig
[![Beautician Pig](Pig Beautician.png "Beautician Pig"){: height="2x2px} ] 
The Beautician Pig, similar to the Banker Pig, is bad because by the time you have an easy source of Feathers you have a better source of Oincs. HOWEVER, unlike the Banker, you get a VERY low amount of Oincs. To make it even worse, the only really sustainable way to get Feathers is with Peagawks, but Peagawks are relatively rare, and you'd save 4 of the feathers for gas mask, leaving with you 3 feathers for 6 Oincs, 2 every day, and Peagawks regain 1 Feather per day (Con)

**Pros and Cons: Beautician Pig**
- She gives a low amount of Oincs (Con)
- She has a daily limit (Con)
- No reliable source of feathers (Con)

### Worker Pig
![Worker Pig](Pig Worker.png "Worker Pig"){: height="1x1px} 
The Worker Pig trades 1 Boards, Rope, Cut Stone, and/or Papyrus once every day for 2 Oincs. He lives in any pig civilization at The Tinkerer's Tower.

#### Judgement: Worker Pig
He's bad for all the same reasons as the Beautician Pig except for the access to trading resources.

**Pros and Cons: Worker Pig**
- He gives you a low amount of Oincs (Con

# Lavae

**Don't Starve Together Exclusive Mob**

![Lavae Image](Lavae.png)

- **Health**: 500
- **Damage**: 50 (Fire Damage)
- **Special Ability**: Sets anything near it on fire.
- **Drops**:
  - Regular: Fire x3
  - Frozen: Rocks ×1-5
- **Spawn Code**: "lavae"
- **Spawns From**: [Dragonfly](Dragonfly.png)
- **Walk Speed**: 5.5
- **Attack Range**: 6
- **Attack Period**: 4

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Too hot to handle."
- Willow: "Why can't we be friends?"
- Wolfgang: "I must run!"
- Wendy: "It burns with the fires of Hell."
- WX-78: "SMELLS LIKE BURNING"
- Wickerbottom: "I believe it is a larval dragonfly."
- Woodie: "Death by axe!"
- Maxwell: "Foul beast! Know your place!"
- Wigfrid: "A fiery foe!"
- Webber: "Sizzling hot!"
- Winona: "I'm gonna squish that!"
- Warly: "You're a pretty cute little sausage link."
- Wortox: "I remember when I was that age."
- Wormwood: "Too hot!"
- Wurt: "Aww, it's just a baby."
- Walter: "That's amazing!"
- Wanda: "Tsk, she just lets her children run wild!"

Choose: Wickerbottom

The **Lavae** is a **Mob** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It has 500 **health** and spawns from the **Dragonfly**. Anything that comes into direct contact with or is next to a Lavae will burst into flames, including the player. The Lavae is immune to fire.

Killing the Lavae will leave **Ashes** from its burnt drop, making it easier to get the Dragonfly back to sleep.

The Lavae dies when it is frozen, dropping 1-5 **Rocks** upon death. Freezing is the easiest way to kill Lavae due to their high health, attack damage, and the fact that many can be spawned in a relatively short time. It takes three hits with the **Ice Staff** to be frozen. The Lavae will also die 30 seconds after being spawned by the Dragonfly.

## Bugs
- Lavae will lose interest in a player who travels through a wormhole, and will not reacquire a new target until attacked by a player again.
- Lavae will not target AI even if attacked.
- Lavae bug out **Campfires** that they light, resulting in permanent fires until server restart.
- A Debug-spawned Lavae will not attack the player and despawn after doing a backflip.

# Fruit Medley

## Overview
The **Fruit Medley** is a Veggie Food Item cooked in a Crock Pot by combining 3.0 units of Fruits (except Dragon Fruit, which will result in Dragonpie). Unless a Twig is added, the recipe for Fruit Medley may result in Fist Full of Jam instead, as they share the same Crock Pot Priority. It takes 10 seconds to cook.

## Details
- **Food Type**: Veggie
- **Icon**: ![Fruit Medley](Fruit Medley.png)
- **Image**: ![Fruit Medley Dropped](Fruit Medley Dropped.png)
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Food Recipe**: 3x Fruit, 1x Filler
- **Spoil Time**: 6 Days
- **Stack Size**: 40
- **HP Restored**: 20
- **Hunger Restored**: 25
- **Sanity Restored**: 5
- **Cook Time**: 10 sec
- **Priority**: 0
- **Spawn Code**: "fruitmedley"

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Fruity."
- Willow: "Yum, fruit!"
- Wolfgang: "Is cup of teensy fruits."
- Wendy: "Sweet, tart and in a cup."
- WX78: "ENERGY IN A CUP"
- Wickerbottom: "What a nice selection of fruit!"
- Woodie: "In syrup!"
- Maxwell: "This would pair great with a simple cheese plate."
- Wagstaff: "A lovely concoction of consumables."
- Wigfrid: "Ugh! Putting it into a cup doesn't fool me."
- Webber: "Pile o'fruit."
- Walani: "A sweet treat!"
- Warly: "Invigorating!"
- Woodlegs: "Tis a scrumptious little morsel."
- Wilba: "FRUIT MAKETH WILBA PLOP"
- Wormwood: "Fruit party!"
- Wheeler: "A cup of cold crops."
- Winona: "Gotta get those vitamins, I guess."
- Wortox: "The mortals threw a bunch of plants together."
- Wurt: "Fruit meldy... moldy... meddle-y?"
- Walter: "It's good for you!"
- Wanda: "Refreshing."

## Prerequisites
- Requires: Fruit
- Excludes: Dragon Fruit, Meats, Vegetables

## Recipe
**Fruit Medley Recipe:**
- **Item1**: Fruit
- **Count1**: 3.0
- **Item2**: Filler (needs to be a Twig or may result in Fist Full of Jam)
- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Fruit Medley

## Examples
- **Durian Example**: 3x Durian, 1x Twigs
- **Pomegranate Example**: 3x Pomegranate, 1x Twigs
- **Pomegranate with Berries**: 2x Pomegranate, 2x Berries (50% chance to result in Fist Full of Jam)
- **Cave Bananas**: 3x Cave Bananas, 1x Ice (50% chance to result in Fist Full of Jam)
- **Halved Coconut**: 3x Halved Coconut, 1x Twigs (Shipwrecked DLC)
- **Banana with Cooked Jellyfish**: 3x Banana, 1x Cooked Jellyfish (Shipwrecked DLC, 50% chance of cooking Fist Full of Jam)

## Usage
- **Fruit Medley**: 1x Fruit Medley
- **Tool**: Pig Icon
- **Result**: Manure

## Tips
- Since the individual hunger value of most compatible ingredients is higher than Fruit Medley itself, the use of a twig as filler is highly recommended to avoid accidentally making a Fist Full of Jam.
- Despite requiring a higher fruit value than Fist Full of Jam, Fist Full of Jam restores more hunger, as such, Fruit Medleys should be made for healing and cooling purposes as opposed to food over Fist Fulls of Jam.

## Bugs
- Fruit Medley does not exclude Fishes.
- Shipwrecked DLC introduces food items that have Fish value without any Meat value, such as Fish Morsel and Jellyfish. This causes using a Fish Morsel or Jellyfish in a recipe with fruit to produce a Fruit Medley despite technically

# Swimming Horror

![Swimming Horror](File:Swimming Horror.png){: width="150px"}

- **Health**: 300
- **Damage**: 20
- **Drops**: Nightmare Fuel ×1-2
- **Attack Period**: 2.5
- **Attack Range**: 3
- **Run Speed**: 3
- **Sanity Aura**: -100
- **DLC**: Shipwrecked
- **Spawn From**: 
- **Spawn Code**: "swimminghorror"
- **Special Ability**: Teleports when attacked

## Exclusive to Shipwrecked and Hamlet

The **Swimming Horror** is a Shadow Creature introduced in the Shipwrecked DLC. It will spawn in the Shallow Ocean. When a player sails past a Swimming Horror, it will swim towards them and try to attack them. It will not give up chase unless the player leaves the Shallows or returns to land. In the Hamlet DLC, Swimming Horrors can also be found in the Lily Pond biome.

### Fighting Strategy

Crawling Horrors, Terrorbeaks, and Swimming Horrors can be attacked if they are actively pursuing the player. Despite their intimidating appearance, individually they are very easy to fight: the basic tactic is to kite them, by walking close enough for them to attack, dodging the attack by walking back, then hitting them. Since they teleport away when damaged, the player won't be able to hit them more than once. However, they will occasionally pause to perform a "yelling" animation, during which it is possible to get one extra hit in without them teleporting, for a maximum of two hits. It is possible for them to teleport within melee range, allowing the player to land a second hit simply by holding the attack button (F by default).

While multiple Crawling Horrors are easy to deal with, a player with incredibly low sanity may have to fend off one or more Terrorbeaks alongside them. If this occurs, it is better to simply run and make distance in order to fight Terrorbeaks individually, due to their sheer speed.

Since they are only visible to the player, mobs cannot be recruited to defend against Shadow Creatures. However, there is an exception in Willow's Bernie, which is the only Mob in the game that's able to taunt Shadow Creatures and attack them.

Tornadoes spawned by the Weather Pain can stop a Shadow Creature's teleports due to its fast and continuous attacks. It is very useful for stopping a group of them during the Nightmare Cycle.

### Number of Hits to Kill Shadow Creatures

## Trivia

- **In-Game**: Shadow Creatures are one of the only mobs able to freely travel through walls and are the only mobs that can freely travel across the barrier that separates land from ocean. They can only do this while not aggressive. When Sanity drops below 15%, they will manifest into a physical form, unable to perform such feats. Attacking a Shadow Creature will cause any other Shadow Creature to become "real" and aggressive, regardless of the Sanity level. The hostility of a Crawling

# Guide for Don't Starve and Don't Starve: Shipwrecked

This is a guide for anyone who has just bought **Don't Starve** and/or the DLC **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**. I will detail how to best set up camp in the game, according to my experience. Please note that this is just my preferred way of starting out each game and player preference will vary by individual.

## Don't Starve

### Basic Needs

Before getting started, it is critical for new players to be aware of three stats that will determine their survival in the game. These stats must be constantly watched and attended to.

![Example of stats draining](Wolfgang drain slow.gif)

- [Hunger](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Hunger): Identified by a yellow stomach icon. As your Hunger grows, the yellow drains and the stomach shrivels. Your character will warn you when their Hunger is getting low. The more your Hunger drops, the more your [Health](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Health) and [Sanity](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Sanity) drop. 

- Health: Identified by a red heart icon. As your Health drains, the red drains. Although the most common form of Health drain is damage caused by [Mobs](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Mobs) or natural factors such as [Fire](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Fire) and [Lightning](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Lightning), your Hunger will also have an effect on your Health. 

- Sanity: Identified by an orange brain icon. As your Sanity drains, the orange drains and the brain shrivels. Various things may cause your character to lose their Sanity: standing by [Evil Flowers](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Flower), fighting Mobs, eating raw [Meats](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Meats), killing animals, etc. But the primary drain is [Dusk](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle#Dusk) and especially [Night](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle#Night). As soon as Dusk falls Sanity begins to fall, continuing throughout the Night. As your Sanity lowers, creepy whispering voices will become louder and louder and [Shadow Creatures](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Creature) will become less and less transparent. When your Sanity has drained to a certain degree, the Shadow Creatures start chasing and attacking you. Your character will sometimes warn you if their Sanity has been drained, such as after they go through a [Worm Hole](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Worm_Hole) (depending on the character). The best way to keep up Sanity is to pick [Flowers](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Flower).

### Day/Night Cycle

![Day/Night Cycle icon](Summer Day-Night cycle.png)

The [Day/Night Cycle](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle) of **Don't Starve** is a constant factor. It acts as a sort of clock, running through three cycles: [Day](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle#Day) (yellow section), Dusk (red section), and Night (blue section). There is an icon on the top right-hand corner of the screen with an arrow that rotates clockwise. You will need to keep track of the time of day, especially how close it is to Night. During the [Summer](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Seasons/Summer) the Day is longer and the Night is shorter, while during Winter the Night is longer and the Day is shorter. When it becomes Dusk, it will get darker and your Sanity will start to go drain slowly. When Night arrives it becomes completely pitch black (unless you have a light source) and Sanity starts to drain faster. When it becomes Day, it will get light and your Sanity will start to increase. If you do not have a light source when Night arrives, [Charlie](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Charlie) will attack you and kill you in two hits.

### Exploration Stage

#### "I started a new game. What now?"

You will start out in Summer, so resources will be abundant. Your initial concern should be gathering materials to make a [Campfire](https://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Campfire). Walk around for a bit, gathering materials as you go. The best place to collect

# Building a Base to Protect You and Your Friends

In this guide, we'll dive straight into how to build a base to keep you and your friends safe. Let's get started!

![A sample base layout](359A09B8-2063-4059-9EE0-D75230D142BF.png "Bases can start out like this, but eventually grow out.")

## Finding the Right Location

First, you will want to find a spacious, empty area. These can typically be found in rocky lands, grasslands, savannas, or forests. Depending on the size of the base you wish to build, you can choose from large plots of land or even just a small corner you've discovered.

## Considering Game Modes

If you're playing on **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** or **Don't Starve Together**, be aware that some monsters (e.g., Hounds) can swim in the ocean. It's recommended to build a seaside wall and place sandbags along it to prevent flooding.

![Basic essentials layout](120342BA-52BE-4522-A2DD-D0BF0CFE6B25.png "Bases can start out like this, but eventually grow out.")

## Placing Basic Essentials

After securing your location, you should place your basic essentials according to the following chart. Each item is worth one point, and you should aim to have at least seven points.

- **Science Machine** / **Alchemy Engine**
- **Chest** (1 point per chest, up to 3 points)
- **Siesta Lean-to** (If not playing as Wickerbottom)
- **Tent** (Same deal as Siesta Lean-to)
- **Bird Trap** (1 point only)
- **Birdcage** (1 point empty, 2 points full)
- **Improved Farm** (1 point per Farm, up to 3 points)
- **Fire Pit**
- **Crock Pot** (1 point per Pot, up to 2 points)
- **Drying Rack** (1 point per rack, up to 2 points)

## Building Walls

Once you have your essentials in place, outline a room with wooden or stone walls. Wooden walls are preferred due to their low crafting cost, abundance per material, and decent protection. Later on, you can upgrade the walls to Thulecite or Moon Rock if you're playing DST.

## Preparing for Winter/Summer

After setting up your base, consider whether it's currently winter or summer, as exploring might not be ideal during these times. Ensure you have enough food to survive the season.

# Woven Shadow

- **Game**: Don't Starve Together
- **Introduced in**: A New Reign
- **Health**: 1
- **Spawns from**: Ancient Fuelweaver
- **Special Ability**: Heals Ancient Fuelweaver (Woven Shadow), Protects Ancient Fuelweaver (Unseen Hand)
- **Walk Speed**: 3 (hand), 1.5 (skull)
- **Sanity Drain**: -40/min
- **Spawn Code**: "stalker_minion1", "stalker_minion2"

## Description
The **Woven Shadow** is a [Mob] exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It has 1 [Health] and spawns from the Ancient Floor by the [Ancient Fuelweaver]. The Woven Skulls will walk to the Ancient Fuelweaver to heal it. The Ancient Fuelweaver restores 400 Health by eating a Woven Shadow. The Unseen Hands that are summoned will summon a shield that makes the Ancient Fuelweaver invulnerable to any attack unless all the Unseen Hands on the field are killed. The Unseen Hands can only be damaged when the player is insane. When the Ancient Fuelweaver dies, the remaining Woven Shadows will become [Nightmare Fuel].

There are 2 variants of Woven Shadows, a skull-shaped Shadow and a hand-shaped Shadow. The skull variant is slower than the player, and the hand variant is faster. Apart from their appearance and speed, they have no other differences.

## Quotes
- Wilson: Anklebiters!
- Willow: Yuck, it's barely even alive.
- Wolfgang: I do not like it!
- Wendy: Death would be a kindness.
- WX-78: ITS MINIONS ARE INFERIOR
- Wickerbottom: The weaver's twisted creation.
- Woodie: Ain't no reason for that to exist.
- Maxwell: A being of living fuel.
- Wigfrid: A fiend wöven fröm the night!
- Webber: Creepy!
- Winona: I don't want that anywhere near me!
- Warly: What creeps!
- Wortox: Silly thing!
- Wormwood: Big Bone Roarer has tiny pals!
- Wurt: Little crawlers!
- Walter: I wonder if I can catch one!
- Wanda: Ack! Get out of here!

## Tips
- Since they only have one health, they are very vulnerable to things like [Earthquake]s, [Abigail], [Weather Pain], and other forms of damage. The fight with the Ancient Fuelweaver is extremely difficult without killing the Shadows, since it can regenerate all of its health back by consuming one wave of them.
- If one does not have access to the items above, teaming up with another player or followers who can take down the shadows for them can be very crucial.

## Trivia
- Woven Shadows were introduced in the **Heart of the Ruins** update.

# Brightshade Gestalt

![Brightshade Gestalt Image](Brightshade_Gestalt.png)

**Spawns from:**  
![Rift Phase 1](Rift_Phase_1)  
![Rift Phase 2](Rift_Phase_2)  
![Rift Phase 3](Rift_Phase_3)

**Spawn Code:** `lunarthrall_plant_gestalt`

**Exclusive to:** Don't Starve Together

**Rift Content:** Lunar Rift

## Behavior

Brightshade Gestalts are mobs exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**. They periodically appear from **Rifts** in their final stage and will take over harvestable plants to create **Deadly Brightshades**.

When a **Rift** reaches its third and final stage, waves of **Brightshade Gestalts** begin to emerge every 3-4 in-game days, with the first immediately appearing when the Rift reaches its final stage. Brightshade Gestalts will seek out and inhabit harvestable plants in groups of three, which then spawns a **Deadly Brightshade** for each Brightshade Gestalt. Up to 5 patches (referred to as "herds" in the code) of plants will be infested per wave, and will prioritize plants placed by players over naturally-generated ones. Brightshade Gestalts can inhabit the following plants: **Berry Bush**, **Grass Tuft** (Grass), **Sapling**, **Weeds** and **Farm Plants**, with the latter two having the highest priority. Each Rift will spawn between 4-6 waves of Brightshade Gestalts before closing.

Brightshade Gestalts will automatically move to their intended plant target no matter how far away they are. Brightshade Gestalts can also move over the **ocean** and take over plants on islands.

Also, when a rift is open, it will appear and inhabit the **Deerclops Carcass**, **Varg Carcass** or **Bearger Carcass**. After this, it takes control of the body and begins to attack the player. To prevent it from entering the carcass, you can simply burn the carcass.

## Transformations

- **Deerclops Carcass** → **Crystal Deerclops**
- **Bearger Carcass** → **Armored Bearger**
- **Varg Carcass** → **Possessed Varg**

## Tips

Because Brightshade Gestalts prioritize the largest groups of plants as well as Farm Plants and Weeds, it is possible to plant unneeded crops far from important areas in order to draw the Brightshade Gestalts away from places where the appearance of Deadly Brightshades may be problematic.

## Description
'''Charlie''', also known as the '''Shadow Queen''', can be seen in-game as her human form in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' as of the ''[[From Beyond#Terrors Below|Terrors Below]]'' update. After players defeat the [[Reanimated_Skeleton#Ancient_Fuelweaver|Ancient Fuelweaver]] and subsequently give 5 [[Dreadstone]] to the Beckoning Hand that appears, Charlie arrives and repairs the [[Ancient Gateway]], leading to [[Shadow Rift]] being activated underground.

When Charlie shows up, the Ruins' [[Nightmare Cycle]] becomes locked at the Nightmare Phase, much like when a key is inserted into the [[Ancient Gateway]]. The Nightmare Cycle unlocks after Charlie disappears.

## Trivia
* When hovered over by most characters, Charlie's name appears as "Shadow Queen," unless the player is [[Maxwell]] or [[Winona]].

## Overview
Weevoles are **Mobs** introduced in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, which spawn in **Tall Grass** fields at **Dusk** and **Night**.

They are aggressive mobs and will attack if the player gets too close. They attack by charging at the player from roughly one tile away. This attack can easily be avoided by running.

If they get low on health, they'll bury themselves in the ground and resurface few seconds later, though **Pog** can attack them while they're underground.

When they die, they drop **Weevole Carapace**, which can be used in the **Crock Pot** to make **Hard Shell Tacos** or to craft the **Weevole Mantle**.

They will eat any plant-related items left on the ground by the player. Those include: **Cork**, **Cut Grass|Grass**, **Grass Tuft**, **Berry Bush**, **Sapling** (item), **Log**s, **Boards**, **Tree|Evergreen** Sapling and **Seeds**.

Weevoles can be caught in **Traps**, killing them instantly and rewarding **Weevole Carapace** when harvested.

## Tips
- Player may want to create their own **Weevole** infested grass in a location more suitable for their needs. To do that they just need to plant the grass, keeping in mind that **Tall Grass** will grow (and not require fertilizer) on turfs **Plains**, **Rainforest**, **Deep Rainforest** or **Dense Turf**. Each time **Tall Grass** regrows, the game attempts to infest it. The chance is higher, the more tall grass is around within 3 turf tiles. Each grass increases chance to become infested by 1%. It means that 100 grasses within 3 tiles will grant 100% chance for any of the 100 grass to become infested as long as there is no other infested grass nearby. The easy way to do that would be planting 25 grass in one tile making sure there are no other grass within 3 tiles. When they regrow each of the 25 grasses will have 25% chance to be infested. The infested grass will stay infested as long as it is not harvested or destroyed in any way.

## Trivia
- The name Weevole is a portmanteau: **Weevils** are a family of beetles, and a **vole** is a small rodent.

# The Eight Steps to Survive and Eliminate Depths Worms

This guide will help you survive and eliminate every Depths Worm in each wave without too much risk. It is also effective when dealing with Hounds in the Surface World. However, it does not guarantee 100% survivability but rather greatly increases it. The accuracy and effectiveness may vary depending on updates, mods, and characters chosen by the player. This guide has proven effective on Don't Starve Reign of Giants: "where there's a Wilson..." update.

## Step 1: Choose a Strategic Location
The first step is to find a suitable place to build a Rock Lobster Pen. Anywhere on the map is possible, making sure it is passable, has enough space, and has no other objects that are blocking the area. The pen would be useless if it is built too far from a strategic point, so choose carefully.

### Strategic Locations for Rock Lobster Pen
- Near the player's main base
- Near forward base/s if there is/are
- Near entrances and exits between worlds like near sink holes
- Any other places which are frequently visited by the player

## Step 2: Pen Building
The second step is to build a series of wall columns with a minimum gap between them in a square pattern. The minimum area required should be 5 by 5 columns of walls, and one side of the area shall remain open to serve as an entrance way. The required type of wall should be stone because it is not flammable, second to the most sturdy, and more common than Thulecite. The minimum required level should be level 1 but the higher the better.

## Step 3: Finding Rock Lobsters
The third step is to find at least 6 Rock Lobsters and herd them to and inside the pen. They can be found in Rocky Plains Biome in Caves. Minimum 6 (4 for 15 Hounds) of these mobs to counter 9 worms without being overwhelmed. Feeding them with minerals will cause them to follow the character. Once they are inside the pen, the player can now block the open side of the pen. Due to lobster's big body, it will not be able to pass the small gap between the columns.

## Step 4: Lighting, Cooling, and Heating
The Fourth Step is to build a Fire Pit and Endothermic Fire Pit. These structures will provide lighting, heating, and cooling to the character depending on the situation. There are also other items that provide as such but these structures are required because these are economical. Overall, it's up to the player which type of light sources he/she will use.

## Step 5: Crafting Required Items
The fifth step is to craft a Bush Hat or acquire the Snurtle Shell Armour and place it near the pen. At least one of this item is required to be available. Other items like Logs and Stone Wall for fuel and repair respectively are also required. Putting those items in a Chest is optional, it's up to the player and not required by this guide.

## Comparison between Bush Hat and Snurtle Shell
- Bush Hats are easily acquired due to Berry Bushes that are so common in the surface. Snurtle Shells however are rare due to Snurtles rarely coming out from their Mound.
- Bush Hats have unlimited durability but does not offer protection. Snurtle Shells offer protection but have limited durability.
- A Bush Hat and a Miner Hat cannot be equipped at the same time. A Snurtle Shell and a Miner Hat is a good combination when the character is in a Cave or Ruins.

## Step 6: Hiding
When growling or howling can be heard, proceed to the nearest pen, light either the Fire Pit or Endothermic Fire Pit, equip the Bush Hat or Snurtle Shell, and Hide near the pen. Worms and Hounds per wave may eventually spawn off screen. The player must wait for those worms to Spawn and aggro the lobsters in the pen. As soon as all the worms have targeted the lobsters or as soon as the carnage is over, the character is now safe to unhide. If a character fails to hide in time, follow step 8 of this guide.

## Step 7: Looting
As soon as the carnage is over, drop the Bush Hat or Snurtle Shell near the pen. The character is not required to carry this item every time, and it should be readily available when the next wave is coming. This is also the right time for looting, repairing, and replenishing the supplies. The player must make sure that the pen is ready for the next wave before going anywhere.

## Step 8: Running for Your Life!
If a character fails to hide in time and has been chased by these worms, the best choice is to run and lure those worms to the nearest pen. Depths Worms are slow-moving mobs that can easily be
