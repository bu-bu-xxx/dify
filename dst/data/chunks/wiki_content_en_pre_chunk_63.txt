# Beefalo

## Overview

Beefalo are neutral animals that spawn in the Savanna biome. Upon death, they drop 4 Meat, 3 Beefalo Wool, and 1 Beefalo Horn (33% chance). Shaving them while asleep also drops 3 Beefalo Wool, which will regrow in three days. When blown, Beefalo Horn causes up to 5 grown Beefalo to follow during daytime.

## Behavior

### Herds

All herds have a "home": the location they were formed in. Beefalo wander away from their home during Day & Dusk, and return to it if outside the wander limit. The herd tends to sleep closely packed together at Night.

### Mating Season

There are 2 Mating Seasons per year. One lasts all Spring. A single beefalo can turn into a sizeable herd during the long Spring mating season.

## Hunting

Beefalo attack every four seconds, making it easy to kite them by quickly striking 5-6 times before dodging.

## Domesticating/Taming a Beefalo

Taming a beefalo takes a considerable amount of time and resources, but can usually be started in the first few days of the game, making a beefalo among the fastest practical ways for the player to explore the non-ocean parts of the world.

### Advantages over other speed boosts

- You needn't cobblestone the world.
- Riding a beefalo negates speed penalties from equipping items like a Marble Suit or Piggyback and allows fast travel regardless of which hand or chest-slot items are equipped.
- A rider beefalo with a glossamer saddle is exactly twice the player's base speed, which takes up multiple equip slots and cobblestone to approach on foot.

### Mounted Combat Mechanics

One may freely make melee attacks with the Beefalo while mounted. Mobs' melee attacks will hit the Beefalo instead of the player, but ranged attacks (e.g. Clockwork Bishop, MacTusk) will target the rider directly.

### Mating Season vs. Taming

A fully domesticated beefalo will no longer go into heat or be influenced by mating season. However, heat poses multiple problems during the taming process.

## Description
A Syrup Pot is used to transfer tree sap into syrup. Only juice can be put in the pot. It can be purchased from Pipton or obtained from one of the locked safes. The syrup pot can be hung on the kettle hanger. The boiling time of the [[sap]] depends on the intensity of the flame in the fireplace and on whether Wilson is standing next to the boiler suspension. Steam starts to flow from the pot as the [[syrup]] is cooked. Unlike other containers, if you overexpose the prepared syrup on the fire, it will "run away", but there will still be one unit of syrup inside the pot, so you don't have to worry and leave the juice boiling for a long time.

- **Wolfgang:** "Are you friendly ghost?"
- **Wendy:** "That's my twin sister, Abigail."
- **WX-78:** "UNDEAD ALERT"

- **Walter:** "Your sister kind of creeps me out, but you're alright!"
- **Wanda:** "Poor thing. Her time came too soon."
- **Choose:** Wendy

Abigail Lillian Carter is Wendy's older twin sister, now dead and thus, a ghost. Wendy can manifest her using her unique starting item, Abigail's Flower. Abigail defends herself and Wendy against attacking Mobs, and she attacks anything that Wendy attacks (even if Wendy withdraws).

In Don't Starve Together, Wendy can summon Abigail with her flower at any time and gain 15 Sanity, or she can dismiss her at the cost of 15 sanity by dragging the flower from her inventory onto Abigail and releasing it there. Additionally, Wendy will lose 30 Sanity if Abigail dies.

Abigail initially has a health pool of only 150 and she doesn't emit light. After a day, her maximum health changes to 300 and she emits enough light to ward off Charlie. After another day, her maximum health increases again to 600 and she emits more light. The process is 4 times faster if there is a fully decorated Sisturn in the World. Abigail returns to her initial health if she is destroyed or if Wendy dies. Abigail regenerates 1 health per second, even when not summoned.

On the Surface, Abigail's attacks damage 15 hp during the day, 25 hp at dusk, and 40 hp at night. In the Caves, her attacks always deal 40 damage. Abigail's attacks beset her targets with ghostly petals, inflicting them with a 10% vulnerability to any damage for 2 seconds. Wendy's attacks deal an extra 40% damage to these foes, putting her at ×1.155 normal player damage instead of her usual ×0.75.

Abigail now has a protective shield. When attacked, the shield surrounds her and absorbs all damage taken within 0.5 seconds of the first attack.

Wendy can ask Abigail to stay close to her or to roam more freely via Abigail's Flower. In the Sooth state Abigail follows Wendy and only supports her. In the Rile up state Abigail attacks anything near Wendy, whether neutral or aggressive.

Wendy can use various Ghostly Elixirs on Abigail to regenerate her health or improve her abilities. Wendy can also use non-food healing items to heal Abigail (Spider Gland, Healing Salve, Honey Poultice, and Mosquito Sack).

## Behavior

Abigail has a rapid area-of-effect attack that damages all enemies next to her. If she attacks pack mobs like Spiders or Beefalo, she can incite the whole group. Abigail can also damage Spider Dens, Beehives, and Killer Bee Hives. She does not attack any mobs that don't threaten her or Wendy first, except for neutral Pikos, Treeguards, and Fishermerms. If her target doesn't appear interested in her or Wendy or if Wendy moves far enough away, Abigail settles down after about two seconds of fighting.

Abigail follows Wendy everywhere, including Caves, but she keeps a minimum distance from her. Abigail can keep up with her as long

## Description
Werepigs are hostile mobs that Pigs and Guardian Pigs can transform into during a Full Moon or after a Pig eats 4 pieces of meat-based Monster Foods. They are hostile and will attack anything nearby. A typical Werepig will transform back into a normal Pig after 4 game hours or at the start of the next day, whichever comes first.

## Combat
Below is the number of hits it takes with each weapon to kill all variations of Pigs when playing with characters who have a default damage modifier.

| Weapon              | No. of hits for Werepig |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Fishing Rod/Bug Net | 166                    |

| Fire Dart          | 4                      |

Werepigs take 2 blasts from the Ice Staff to be frozen or 3 Sleep Darts to be put to sleep.

## Tips
- If the player has enough Monster Foods, more resources can be gained by killing Werepigs instead of normal Pigs. Give it four Monster Meats to make it turn. Naughtiness will not be gained for killing Werepigs, nor will Pigs attack you for attacking the Werepig.
- A Werepig can be used to convert stacks of Petals or other unwanted Vegetables to Manure as it will eat through a whole stack in one sitting without chasing anything.
- A Werepig pack is dangerous. It is advised that one stays away from Pig Villages during the night of the full moon. If one wants to kill a Werepig, it is best to use the alternative method by feeding a normal Pig Monster Meats during the day.
- A Werepig will run against walls without destroying them if there's food across from the walls. Putting a non-spoiling edible item like Rot out of their reach lets one build walls around Pigs without having to worry about their full moon rampages.
- In Don't Starve Together, Pigs have a chance to turn into a Werepig when they are haunted by a Ghost Character.
- Feeding a Werepig with 27 raw Red Caps will kill the werepig.

# Woodie

![Woodie Portrait](Woodie_Original_Portrait.png)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health    | 150   |
| Hunger    | 150   |
| Sanity    | 200   |
| Beaverness| 100   |

Starting Items:
- ![Lucy the Axe](Lucy_the_Axe)
- ![Kitschy Beaver Idol](Kitschy_Beaver_Idol)
- ![Kitschy Moose Idol](Kitschy_Moose_Idol)
- ![Kitschy Goose Idol](Kitschy_Goose_Idol)

Favorite Food:
- ![Honey Nuggets](Honey_Nuggets)

## Abilities

Woodie starts with an Axe named **Lucy**. Lucy is sentient and communicates with Woodie in red text, differing from Woodie's white text. Lucy has infinite durability and reduces the number of chops required to chop a tree but deals less damage compared to a normal Axe.

Woodie has the ability to recruit followers more effectively than other characters. For example, a Pig can follow for a maximum of 24 minutes, while for other characters it is only 20 minutes.

In DST, Woodie has three transformations: **Werebeaver**, **Weremoose**, and **Weregoose**. The Wereness Meter has a value of 100 points and decays at a rate depending on the moon phase and actions performed. A full moon will halve the decay rate.

Woodie can transform into one of his Were forms by eating one of the Kitschy Idols.

## Wereness Meter

The Wereness Meter's drain rate has three levels:
- Slowest: -25/minute (-12.5/minute during full moon)
- Faster: -40/minute (-20/minute during full moon)
- Fastest: -400/minute (-200/minute during full moon)

Certain actions (gnawing for Werebeaver, fighting for Weremoose, running for Weregoose) reset the timer and drain rate back to the slowest level.

## Werebeaver

![Werebeaver](Werebeaver.png)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health    | 150   |
| Damage    | 27.2 (44.2 to trees) |
| Armor     | 25%   |
| Sanity Loss| -6/min |
| Speed     | 1.1x  |

## Weremoose

![Weremoose](Weremoose.png)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health    | 150   |
| Damage    | 59.5  |
| Armor     | 90%   |
| Sanity Loss| -6/min |
| Speed     | 0.9x  |

## Weregoose

![Weregoose](Weregoose.png)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health    | 150   |
| Sanity Loss| -6/min |
| Speed     | 1.4x  |

## Skill Tree

Woodie has two main skill trees: **Curse** and **Lumberjack**. Each tree provides unique abilities and upgrades.

### Curse Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Transformation Timer | Were-forms last longer. |
| Curse Embracer | No health or sanity penalties for eating Kitschy Idols. |
| The Werebeaver | Increase mining and chopping speed in Werebeaver form. |
| The Weremoose | Increase damage and resistance in Weremoose form. |
| The Weregoose | Increase speed and provide waterproofing in Weregoose form. |

### Lumberjack Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Quick Picker | Collect resources faster. |
| Woodworker | Carve boards and hats more efficiently. |
| Treeguard Feller | Deal more damage to Treeguards. |

## Tips

- Due to Lucy's infinite durability, it's wasteful to craft other axes unless desperately needed.
- Prepare for Full Moon transformations by calculating the days in advance.
- Transform near your camp or a safe place to regain lost stats.
- Woodie's favorite food is Honey Nuggets, providing a hunger bonus.
- Woodie is immune to Sandstorm slowness while transformed.
- Keep health full before transforming, especially with Weremoose.
- The Weregoose is excellent for early game exploration.

## Affinity

Woodie can gain affinity with either shadows or the moon, providing unique bonuses and effects.

| Affinity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Shadow Affinity | Gain bonuses against Lunar Aligned creatures and protection from Shadow Aligned creatures. |
| Lunar Affinity | Gain bonuses against Shadow Aligned creatures and protection from Lunar Aligned creatures. |

# Pumpkin Lantern (Jack o' Lantern)

## Overview
![Pumpkin Lantern night](Pumpkin Lantern night.png "Pumpkin Lantern glowing at night")

The Pumpkin Lantern is a stationary light source that can be carried in the inventory and placed at any time. It requires 1 Pumpkin and 1 Fireflies to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. It only illuminates during dusk and night.

## Crafting
- **Tier:** 1
- **Ingredients:**
  - Pumpkin x1
  - Fireflies x1

## Details
- **Durability:**
  - 8 minutes in Summer
  - 10 minutes in Spring and Autumn
  - 13 minutes 20 seconds in Winter
- **Perk:** Provides small amounts of light
- **Spawn Code:** pumpkin_lantern
- **Description:** Spooky illumination
- **Stackable:** Does not stack

## In-Game Effects
- The Pumpkin Lantern perishes after being on the ground for different durations depending on the season:
  - Summer: 10 minutes (1 ¼ game days)
  - Winter: 13 minutes 20 seconds (about 1 ¾ game days)
- Can be picked up at any time by pressing the Space Key or Left Mouse Button (LMB) while not having any tools or weapons equipped; otherwise, it will be attacked and smashed, leaving the Fireflies behind.

## Don't Starve Together
- In DST, the Pumpkin Lantern lasts significantly longer:
  - Summer: 42 minutes 40 seconds
  - Spring and Autumn: 53 minutes 20 seconds
  - Winter: 71 minutes 6 ⅔ seconds

## Hallowed Nights
- During Hallowed Nights, Pumpkin Lanterns spawn around the Florid Postern and in Pig Villages for decoration.

  - Summer: 170 minutes 40 seconds
  - Spring and Autumn: 213 minutes 20 seconds
  - Winter: 284 minutes 26 ⅔ seconds

## Trivia
- Maxwell's quote upon examining the Pumpkin Lantern, "Why hello, Mr. Crane," is a reference to Ichabod Crane from Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."

## Behavior
Spiders are commonly found aggressive monsters that live in Spider Dens. They can also be spawned from a Spider Queen. They are generally nocturnal; only coming out in daylight if their den is attacked, or if the webbing from their dens is stepped on. Spiders are generally found wandering alone, but will join together if one of them is attacked. When killed, all types of Spiders drop either one Monster Meat, a piece of Silk, or a Spider Gland.

When playing as Webber, a spider can be tamed by feeding them any kind of meat; even Monster Meat. When tamed, it will attack any creature Webber attacks except Shadow Creatures. The spider can be dismissed if the Shoo Box is used. If the Webby Whistle is used, any spider in any tier den (even Spider Warriors) will emerge for a few seconds, then retreat back to their den. However, the Webby Whistle can also be used for pacifying tamed spiders, if they aggro on another player or monster, they'll come back to Webber. Any spider can be turned into another type of spider if Webber uses a Switcherdoodle on them.

Spiders have a chance to spawn after picking Tumbleweeds.

Webber also can pick up spider to inventory.

## Hunting
Spiders found wandering at Night can easily be killed with melee weapons. When hit, Spiders will be stunlocked and unable to attack for a few moments, during which time they can be hit again. After the first Spider is hit, other nearby Spiders will come to defend it. If they are far enough apart, each Spider can be quickly killed before the others are in range. If the Player is being chased by multiple Spiders close together, they can kite them. This involves striking a Spider and then running out of range before other Spiders can attack. Over time, each Spider will be hit multiple times and killed.

At night, most Spiders will leave their Dens. Larger Dens, however, contain many Spiders (Tier 2 and 3 Dens spawn Spider Warriors), and only a few leave at a time. When one of these Spiders is killed, another Spider will emerge to take its place. Killing these Spiders as they leave will slowly empty the Den and allow it to be destroyed. Emptying a Den in this manner will also prevent the spawning of Spider Warriors, who will spawn if the Den is attacked before it is empty. Another way is

Tallbirds are black, two-legged, flightless Birds with tiny wings normally found in Rockyland biomes. They guard their Tallbird Nest, attacking anything nearby. They are considered innocent creatures even though they are not passive or neutral, and killing one adds 2 points to the player's naughtiness level. Tallbirds take three blasts from the Ice Staff to be frozen. If killed, they drop 2 Meat and will respawn from their Nest after 5 days.

Tallbirds lay a speckled, pale-blue Tallbird Egg. Tallbird Eggs do not spoil and can be used in a Crock Pot or hatched into a Smallbird. If a Tallbird Egg is stolen, the Tallbird will chase the player for 3-5 screens. At night (and sometimes during the day), the Tallbird will curl up in its nest. If a Tallbird is attacked while it is asleep, it will remain curled up for a few seconds, allowing the player to land a few free hits before it can attack. Tallbirds can create new nests on rocky tiles, or tiles that were dug up. Allowing for tallbirds to be relocated, or moved into farms.

Tallbirds may be found clustered together in a Set Piece called Tallfort, where 20 or so Tallbird Nests are placed in a square around multiple Boulders.

Tallbird Eggs that are unharvested from their nest will hatch at the beginning of Spring and one or more Smallbirds will spawn near the nest.

# Amulets

Amulets are a type of magic item that provide the player with passive effects. These include: The [Life Giving Amulet], The [Construction Amulet], The [Chilled Amulet], the [Nightmare Amulet], [The Lazy Forager], and the [Magiluminescence].

## Life Giving Amulet
"I wonder who used to own this." [![Life Giving Amulet](Life Giving Amulet.png "Allows the player to resurrect instantly upon death.")](Life Giving Amulet.png)

- [[Wendy]]

The **Life Giving Amulet** is a craftable item found in the Magic tab. It requires 3 Gold Nuggets, 2 Nightmare Fuel, and 1 Red Gem to craft and a Prestihatitator to prototype. It can also be found when a Grave is dug up, it can randomly drop from a Slot Machine or be dropped by an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when it is damaged with a Hammer, Gunpowder etc.

If the player dies while having a Life Giving Amulet equipped in the chest slot, they will be resurrected at the beginning of the next day, with an immediate time skip through the night. In Don't Starve Together to be resurrected you need to click on the amulet as a ghost. After resurrection, nearby mobs are put to sleep and the amulet is destroyed.

## Construction Amulet
[![Construction Amulet](Construction Amulet.png "Makes crafting cost 50% less crafting ingredients.")](Construction Amulet.png)

"'We could be good friends, you and I.'" - [[Winona]]

The **Construction Amulet** is a craftable item found in the Ancient Tab. It requires 1 Green Gem, 3 Nightmare Fuel and 2 Thulecite, and at least a Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. It also can randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when the latter is damaged with a Hammer, Gunpowder/Slurtle Slime etc. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Construction Amulets cannot be prototyped and Characters always need to be near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft them again.

While having it equipped in the chest slot, crafting items requires half the materials they would normally consume, rounded up. It degrades by 20% each time an item is crafted. It will also provide the player with a passive +2 sanity per minute.

## Chilled Amulet
[![Chilled Amulet](Chilled Amulet.png "Keeps the player cold and restores sanity, along with slowing attackers.")](Chilled Amulet.png)

"The gem appears to be sucking energy out anything it touches." - [[Wickerbottom]]

The **Chilled Amulet** is a craftable item found in the Magic tab. It requires a Prestihatitator to prototype and costs 3 Gold Nuggets and 1 Blue Gem to craft. It also can randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when the latter is damaged with a Hammer, Gunpowder etc. It can be equipped in the chest slot and lasts for 6 minutes (3/4th of an in-game day). While a player has the Chilled Amulet equipped, they will gain +2 sanity per minute.

This comes with temperature loss, which can cause Freezing. Anything that attacks the player wearing the Chilled Amulet will be slowed down and then frozen if attacks are repeated, similar to how the Ice Staff needs several hits to freeze certain mobs. Each hit the player receives while wearing the Chilled Amulet (no matter the damage dealt) costs the Amulet 3% of its durability.

## Nightmare Amulet
[![Nightmare Amulet](Nightmare Amulet.png "Makes the player experience insanity without having to be insane.")](Nightmare Amulet.png)

"I must be crazy to fool around with this." - [[Warly]]

The **Nightmare Amulet** is a craftable item found in the Magic Tab. It costs 6 Gold Nuggets, 4 Nightmare Fuel, and 2 Purple Gems to craft and requires a Shadow Manipulator to prototype. It can also be dropped by an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when it is damaged with a Hammer, Gunpowder, etc. It can be equipped in the chest slot and lasts for 3 minutes and 12 seconds (2/5th of an in-game day).

While it's equipped, the Nightmare Amulet allows the player to experience the effects of 0 Sanity without actually setting the character's Sanity to 0. The screen will become distorted with the usual low Sanity effects, and Shadow Creatures will spawn. While under effects of the Nightmare Amulet, more Shadow Creatures will spawn and more frequently, compared to the player being insane without the amulet. During this time, the player's Sanity will start dropping by 3.33

# The Constant

**Spoilers Warning:** This page contains spoilers for the plot of Don't Starve Adventure Mode as well as story elements of Don't Starve Together. Read at your own risk.

![Winona has just arrived at The Constant](DST2021 winona into the constant.png "Winona at The Constant")

The Constant is the main setting of Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together. Most of the main characters were trapped in these worlds through various means and are forced to survive its many perils.

## Setting

The Constant consists of all the playable areas of Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together, including the Surface World, Caves, Ruins, and possibly the worlds of DLCs and Time Limit Events. These areas are contained in separate dimensions within the Constant itself. In Don't Starve Together, the Florid Postern connects survivors' dimensions, allowing survivors to travel between them.

![A camp set up by survivors to survive in The Constant](2020Musical Base.png "Survivors' Camp")

The Constant is under the influence of "Them" and the current occupant of the Nightmare Throne. During Don't Starve, this throne was ruled by Maxwell, but by the end of Adventure Mode, he is freed and replaced by the player character. As of Don't Starve Together's expansion A New Reign, the throne was taken away from Wilson by Charlie.

## Rules

Time doesn't flow normally in the Constant, expressed through Maxwell and Charlie who both wonder how much time has passed in the real world in certain quotes. Also, some objects from earth of the future are appearing in The Constant, like soda cans invented in the 1970s.

Many things operate differently in The Constant. According to Wagstaff's quotes, much of the unreal artwork and game design in the game actually happens in the Constant. Other inconsistencies include rapid day cycles, plants and creatures that never reproduce but appear out of thin air, fish's eyes turning into an "X" when they die, and marble suits only getting heavier when worn.

The concept of dying and restarting a world in-game seems to be an aspect of the Constant itself, meaning that each time a survivor is killed, they're revived in a different dimension.

## Interactions

Characters from the real world have entered the Constant through different methods. Maxwell and Charlie were taken into the Constant through the Codex Umbra, as shown in The Amazing Maxwell - The Final Act. This event is implied to have caused the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake.

In Forbidden Knowledge, Maxwell (through a PR-76 radio) offered Wilson secret knowledge to build the portal known as Maxwell's Door which brought him into the Constant once activated.

Wagstaff and WX-78 built a similar portal to enter the Constant. In Next of Kin, this portal created an explosion that destroyed itself and eventually the entire Voxola factory. Winona was able to repair this portal before the entire building collapsed. Suddenly, Charlie came through it in her Night Monster form and dragged Winona into the portal.

In Constant Companion, Walter encountered a PR-76 radio in Woodie's abandoned cabin. The Compendium entry for this event says "it is a trap that had lain dormant for years". Upon turning the knob, shadow hands appeared and grabbed Walter, taking him into the Constant.

## Sentient Species

In spite of the hostility of the world and the takeover from Them, there are many sentient species that inhabit the Constant.

- The Ancient Civilization were once the dominant species of the Constant, they were a race of arthropod creatures who were technologically and magically advanced. They were eventually brought to extinction by the overuse of nightmare fuel.
- Pigs are the most common and widespread sentient species in the Constant after the takeover from Them, including the normal Pigs, Guardian Pigs and their Pig King from the Constant's mainland, Wildbores in the Tropics, and the most advanced being the Pig Traders and Royal Guards on the Plateau.
- Merms are another common sentient species in the Constant, they are found on the Mainland and the Tropics, though are absent from the Plateau. As Maxwell quotes, Merms existed in the Constant before his own reign on the world.
- MacTusk N' Son are a duo of sentient walruses who come to the Constant’s mainland to set up camp during Winter, Maxwell knows MacTusk and may have created him, as he is shocked that MacTusk is hostile towards him after being freed from the Nightmare Throne.

## Trivia

- The Constant was first named in Don't Starve Together for the text description of certain Curios released during The Forge in 2017.
- The Constant has not yet been directly named in-game outside of flavor text for various Curios, though Maxwell still refers to it as "his world" in some of his examination quotes for Don't Starve Together.

## Description
Hounds are monsters that attack periodically in packs. They attack every 3–13 days and can also spawn from Hound Mound. At least two Hounds will typically appear during an attack, which is signaled by growling noises heard for a short time. The player will also comment on the growling three times until it stops, and the Hounds attack. More Hounds will spawn at a time as the game progresses.

## Periodic Hound Attacks
When a Hound attack is imminent, snorting and growling sounds will be heard. These sounds start off softly and grow louder as the Hounds approach. Characters will also call attention to these sounds with phrases such as, "Did you hear that?". Usually, these warnings appear at least twice before the Hounds come. When the Hounds appear, the growling sounds will be replaced with the very real running and panting sounds that Hounds make when they attack.

## Behavior
Hounds are naturally aggressive, but easily distracted as they will attack all creatures on sight. Hounds will immediately charge the player when they spawn during a Hound attack. After a while, they can become distracted by nearby Mobs or Meat.

## Fighting Strategy
Hounds are much faster than the player and cannot be outrun unless they become distracted or belong to a Hound Mound. The player can use a Walking Cane or run along a Road to outrun them.

## Tips
- While Hounds are attacking, Chester can and will be targeted.
- 2 or 3 Hounds can usually be defeated, without issue, by using a Spear, Log Suit, and Football Helmet.
- Out of all the Hound variants, the Red Hound is the most volatile as it will burn anything around it upon its death by setting flames on the floor which could lead to serious loss of flammable Structures and Items. It is advised to fight them in an isolated area from the flammable Structures and Items.

## Trivia
- Hounds and Red Hounds were added in "The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You" update.
- Blue Hounds were added in "A Winter's Tale" update.
- According to Wickerbottom, a Hound's Tooth contains brimstone, also known as sulfur. In folklore, sulfur is often associated with demons, implying that the in-game Hounds are Hellhounds, a supernatural dog common in some mythologies or beliefs.

## Bugs
- Saving the game when the Hound attack warning begins and then loading that save will cause the attack to become bugged. The Hounds will arrive extremely late, up to 7 days, and the warning will persist indefinitely, making the player unable to use Tents and other items that require a "safe" condition.

### Catching Rabbits Methods

#### Standard Bait Usage:
1. Drop the trap on the ground to place it.
2. Select **Carrots** or **Berries** and move them on top of the trap, a text "Bait" will appear.
3. Left clicking will place one item inside the trap.
4. Once the trap has been activated, moving the cursor over the trap will show "Check Trap".
5. Left clicking again will send the rabbit and the trap into your inventory.

#### One Bait For All:
- Drop bait on the ground and set traps in between the rabbit and the bait.
- Rabbits will move in a straight line towards the bait, activating the trap when passing through.
- This strategy works with multiple targets as long as players have enough traps or can retrieve and reposition the trap without scaring off the rest.

#### No Bait:
- The trap will trigger whenever a rabbit gets too close.
- As long as players can get the rabbits to move close enough, bait is not necessary.
- One method is placing a trap (or two for better results) blocking the rabbit's way towards its hole, then scaring them from the other side.

* The trap does not need to block its path towards the rabbit hole, but it would take more practice to chase the rabbit into the trap.
* When there are several rabbit holes nearby, it becomes very hard to use this method.
* Another method is to place the trap over the rabbit hole. This method does not need the presence of the player, as rabbits are caught in the trap when they enter or exit the hole. It would be preferable to use this technique if rabbits are not in immediate demand.

# Lost Relics

The **Lost Relics** are Items exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. The Lost Idol, Lost Totem, and Relic Fragment can be found in various locations while exploring the world and can be sold for a **Tenpiece Oinc**. None of the relics stack in the player's **Inventory**. Lost Relics sink in water and become **Sunken Object**.

**Lost Idol**, **Lost Totem**, and **Relic Fragment** are renewable since **Peculiar Objects** are renewable as well. However, **Blue Sow**, **Jeweled Truffle**, **Royal Crown**, and **Royal Scepter** are irreplaceable.

**Blue Sow** and **The Jewelled Truffle** can only be found in a room of an **Ancient Pig Ruins** that leads to another island, found in the ruins to the third and second islands respectively. The room will be filled with pressure plates that trigger dart traps, being fully illuminated during the day. The **Regal Scepter** can be found on the BFB island, and the **Royal Crown** is dropped by the **Queen Womant** (returning the crown to Queen Malfalfa will unlock **Wilba** for players who have not yet unlocked her). Attempting to sell any of these relics to any trader other than the **Pig Queen** will result in rejection and one of the following comments:

- NO 'TIS PRICELESS!
- IT IS FOUND! MUST FIND QUEEN
- I CANNOT TAKE, BELONG TO ROYALTY

A player can give any and all of them to the Queen for a **Royal Gallery Key**, which will allow players to take one rare item (the **Can of Silly String**, which can be used to make the **Skyworthy**, the **Key to the City**, which allows players to build their own Hamlet structures, or **Executive Hammer**, which is the only way to destroy Hamlet structures).

| Can be found | Can be sold to |
| --- | --- |
| * Directly on the ground in the **Deep Rainforest** **Biome**. * Attached to a statue (obtainable with **Ball Pein Hammer**). **Tempting Idol**, **Erroding Totem**, **Crumbling Visage**. * Inside a **Peculiar Objects** (examined with **Magnifying Glass**). * As a Sunken Object in the **Lily Pond** Biome (**Fishing Rod** or **Trawl Net** **Shipwrecked icon**). * Rarely under **Stone Slab**s in the Deep Rainforest Biome. * On the top of some statues in the **Ancient Pig Ruins**. | * The **Professor** at the **Swinesbury Academy** * The characters aforementioned, directly in the street. * The **Pig Queen** (only **The Blue Sow** and **The Jeweled Truffle**, The **Regal Scepter**, and **Royal Crown**) at the **Palace**. |

The **Lureplant** is a hostile plant which is so named for its behavior of dangling **meats** to attract prey. Like **Krampus**, a Lureplant has its own inventory, which is filled with the items its Eyeplants (see below) have stored but not yet digested. It has the capability of storing and digesting just about anything that can fit in the player's inventory.

When a Lureplant is ready to produce a lure but no meat is available, it will produce **Leafy Meat** as a lure instead. This lure, along with any other meats the Lureplant may use as bait, may be harvested by unequipping any weapon so that the option to "harvest meat" appears instead of "attack". When a meat is successfully harvested from a Lureplant, all Eyeplants will disappear, and the bulb will revert to a "just planted" look. The bulb will not display another meat until it is capable of producing Eyeplants 2 days later. If a Lureplant dangles the same lure for more than the time it takes for the lure to spoil, harvesting it will give nothing. The player can hit the Lureplant to make it retract its empty tendril, and soon, it'll come out again with a fresh Leafy Meat. During **Winter**, Lureplants will withdraw their roots and Eyeplants, producing no lures. When a Lureplant with Leafy Meat is attacked by a **Frog**, the leafy meat will be stolen by the frog and the Lureplant will immediately produce another Leafy Meat.

Without any damage multipliers, Lureplants take 9 hits with a **Spear**, 8 with a **Bat Bat**, 6 with a **Tentacle Spike**, **Ham Bat**, and **Thulecite Club**, and 5 with a **Dark Sword** to die. Killing a Lureplant will also allow the player to collect one Leafy Meat in addition to any items the Lureplant has collected in its inventory, but has not yet been digested. Additionally, a Lureplant will always drop a **Fleshy Bulb** after death, which may be replanted on any valid turf.

Every player, who has stayed on surface world for 1440-2400 seconds in spring, has a 1/(number of players on surface when the random draw is done) chance of spawning a Lureplant. If there is only 1 player on the Surface during spring, provided the player does not visit the Caves or disconnect, a Lureplant would spawn by 2400 seconds of spring time. Visiting the Caves or disconnecting will reset the Lureplant timer, hence interrupting the Lureplant spawn. The Crabby Hermit's island will spawn a Lureplant on day 36.

They spawn around the current location of the player periodically during specific seasons. L

# Willow

## Character Information
- **Name**: Willow
- **Image**: ![Willow Portrait](Willow_Original_Portrait.png)
- **Health**: 150
- **Hunger**: 150
- **Sanity**: 120
- **Sanity Multiplier**: -1.1x and +1.1x, up to +11/min per nearby fire
- **Start Items**: Willow's Lighter, Bernie
- **Favorite Food**: Spicy Chili

## Unlocking
Like most characters in Don't Starve Together, Willow is available for free.

## Unique Items
Willow starts a new world with her Lighter and Bernie.

| Item | Utility |
| --- | --- |
| ![Willow's Lighter](Willow's_Lighter) | Has similar utility to a Torch, but with an increased durability at the cost of a reduced light radius. The Lighter can also be used to cook food, each use depleting 1% durability. Willow regains +0.6 sanity/min while the Lighter is equipped. |
| ![Bernie](Bernie) | Can be equipped in the Hand slot, granting Willow +60 Freezing resistance and +2 sanity/min. When Willow is at ≤21.6 (18%) Sanity and Bernie is placed on the ground, he will transform into a giant and defend Willow from hostile creatures; However, if a different insane survivor is nearby or there is already a BERNIE! for all accountable Willows, any spare Bernies will not grow in size and instead taunt enemies to redirect their aggro onto him. Bernie has a durability of 15 days (1000/2000 hp when transformed), though he can be fully repaired with a Sewing Kit. |

## Perks
- Willow is immune to fire damage.
- Willow's body temperature increases at a reduced rate.
- Any fuel that Willow adds to a fire has +50% fuel value.
- Willow cooks food in half the normal time.
- Willow regains Sanity when in proximity to fire.
- Willow has a 1.1x Sanity modifier.

## Disadvantages
- Willow is not immune to overheating.
- Willow hates the cold and suffers additional penalties from it.
- Willow's Sanity modifier applies to both positive and negative Sanity auras.
- Willow performs a charging animation when casting a spell, which cannot be interrupted.

## Skill Tree
For a detailed view of Willow's skill tree, see the [Insight] page.

## Tips
- There is no cap to the amount of sanity/min that Willow can gain from multiple fires.
- It is advised to eventually move to better portable light sources than Willow's Lighter.
- Willow's resistance to Overheating can be really useful during Summer.
- Willow's low base sanity allows her to easily avoid Shadow Creatures.
- When paired with Webber or Wilson, Willow can make her Bernie more easily.
- Willow's favorite food is Spicy Chili, meaning that she gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming the food.

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: Yikes! A little too crabby for me.
- **Willow**: He doesn't look too happy...
- **Wolfgang**: This makes Wolfgang very scared AND hungry.
- **Wendy**: One of us will be sent to a watery grave...
- **WX-78**: A FLESHSACK DISGUISED AS A NON-FLESHSACK
- **Wickerbottom**: I wonder if its size is natural or caused by lunar mutations?
- **Woodie**: I think we might've bothered him.
- **Mathew**: Say, pal, why don't we try to work this out?
- **Wigfrid**: Have at thee, cursed crustacean!
- **Webber**: He looks pretty crabby!
- **Winona**: Looks like he thinks he's the boss around here.

- **Wormwood**: Crabby...
- **Wurt**: Glurp... he kinda cranky.
- **Walter**: YES!! Now that's a proper sea monster!
- **Wanda**: Ah! There you are, you old codger!

## Behavior

The Crab King's fighting abilities depend on the number of gems of each color socketed into him. Iridescent Gems count as 1 of each color, and the Pearl's Pearl counts as 3 of each color.

- **Health**: Depends on the number of [[Red Gem]]s.
- **Spells**: About every 10 seconds, summons geysers under all boats in the vicinity (radius of 25). Each geyser does 10 damage to boats and creates a small leak (-0.5 [[File:Boat Meter (DST).png|20px|text-bottom]]/s).
- **Imposing Claws**: Summoned when health is below 90%. Health and number depend on the number of [[Green Gem]]s.
- **Freezing**: When health is below 85%, regularly casts a spell that lowers the temperature of players and freezes them for 10 seconds at the end. The temperature decrease and radius depend on the number of [[Blue Gem]]s.
- **Healing**: When health is below 85%, tries to heal himself every 40 seconds. The healing process takes 10 seconds.

## Fight

The Crab King can be found in the Swell Ocean inside a circle of Sea Stacks in its Inert form. Players must socket 9 Gems to turn him into his aggressive form and start the boss fight. His position can be indicated by the Astral Detector if the Inactive Celestial Tribute has not yet dropped.

## Imposing Claw

- **Health**: 500-750
- **Damage**: 35 [[File:Boat Meter (DST).png|20px|text-bottom]] (Initially), 17.5 [[File:Boat Meter (DST).png|20px|text-bottom]] (Periodic)
- **Attack Period**: 3-4
- **Walk Speed**: 1
- **Drops**: {{pic24|Meat}}×1

Imposing Claws are summoned by the Crab King when his health is below 90%. They move slowly in the water, looking for boats to clamp onto. When they clamp, they remain attached, which prevents the boat from moving completely. The player must kill them to free the boat.

# Vegetarian Foods

Vegetarian Foods are Food Items that are not Meat, Fish, or Egg. The only exceptions are Waffles and Puffed Potato Soufflé which both take Eggs to cook but are still considered vegetarian. Vegetarian Foods are the only Food that Wurt, Merms, Loyal Merm Guards, and the King of the Merms will eat.

Wurt will get 33% extra Hunger if she eats Vegetables, Fruits, or Butterfly Wings which means she also gets extra Hunger on almost every vegetarian Crock Pot recipe and on every vegetarian Portable Crock Pot recipe. The total Hunger she gets from each Food Item is listed next to the normal amount of Hunger they give in the tables below.

Note that although Merms and Loyal Merm Guards do not eat Fish, they still accept them as gift and will still follow you if you give them one. There are two exceptions to the prohibition of Fish eating: Popperfishes will be eaten for 12.5 hunger and Corn Cods for 25 hunger by Merms, Loyal Merm Guards, and the King of the Merms.

- Wendy: It's drab and flavorless...
- WX-78: INSERT FOOD INTO FACEPLATE
- Wickerbottom: At least I shouldn't have to worry about it being undercooked.
- Woody: It never tastes the same as actual meat...
- Maxwell: How pedestrian.
- Wigfrid: This will suffice until I find real meat.
- Webber: This hamburger tastes kind of... grassy?
- Winona: It's not like any burger I've ever tried.
- Warly: Perhaps this is how we'll convince Mademoiselle Wigfrid to eat her vegetables?
- Wortox: Mortals seem to get quite irritated when you mess with their food.
- Wormwood: Hmmm
- Wurt: Glurph, not real veggie!
- Walter: It's not quite the same.
- Wanda: It has a very interesting texture.

| Vegetables | 1.0 |
| Filler | 1 |

## Examples
### Example 1
| Ingredient | Quantity |

| Onions | 1 |
| Kelp Fronds | 2 |
| Result | Veggie Burger |

### Example 2

## Tips
If one has a Lureplant farm and a reliable way of obtaining Onions, Veggie Burgers can be a solid balanced food option. However, Beefy Greens might be preferable for health and hunger. Jelly Salad provides more sanity but requires 2 Leafy Meat, resulting in less stats if Leafy Meat is the limiting factor.

## Trivia
The Veggie Burger was introduced in the "Troubled Waters" update.

- **Choose**: webber

The Gummy Cake is a Crock Pot dish introduced in the Hamlet DLC. It requires at least 1 raw or cooked Gummy Slug and at least 1 Sweetener, and the Sweetener value cannot exceed 2. At the exception of another Slug, fillers cannot be Meats. It is possible for the filler to be Twigs.

Gummy Cake is one of the best hunger-restoring crock pot food items in the game, tied with the Meaty Stew, Fresh Fruit Crepes, Bone Bouillon, and Mandrake Soup. It restores 150 Hunger when eaten (which corresponds to the whole Hunger bar of all the characters, except Wolfgang, Webber, Wilba, Wagstaff, upgraded WX-78, Wilbur, or Warly), but at the cost of 3 Health and 5 Sanity.

## Prerequisites
- Requires: Gummy Slug
- Requires: Sweetener
- Excludes: Meats
- Excludes: Mandrake

## Recipe
- **Item1**: Gummy Slug
- **Item2**: Sweetener
- **Item3**: Filler
- **Count3**: 2
- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Gummy Cake

## Examples
1. Gummy Slug, Honey, Twigs x2
2. Gummy Slug x3, Honeycomb
3. Cooked Gummy Slug, Honey, Radish, Berries

## Tips
- The Gummy Cake lasts for 20 days, which can be beneficial as an emergency food for long journeys or when the player is approaching starvation.
- Its easy-to-acquire ingredients make it a great food item for characters who could find it harder to keep well fed, such as Wolfgang and Warly.

## Trivia
- During the Pig Fiesta event, Gummy Cake takes on a more festive appearance.
- Despite not requiring a Meat ingredient, Wigfrid can still eat a Gummy Cake. It must be noted that even though in the game it is not meat, it technically is in real life, as escargots contain a decent amount of proteins.

# Riled Lucy

- **Equip Slot:** Hands
- **Image:** ![Lucy_the_Axe](Lucy_the_Axe.png)
- **Damage:** 20
- **Perk:** Can be thrown for 30 damage. (Very fast cooldown + Any enemy struck when thrown will aggro to the attacker. If anyone other than Woodie attempts to pick up or throw this weapon, the perk of Woodie's abilities will not apply to them.)
- **Spawn Code:** `lavaarena_lucy`
- **Exclusivity:** Don't Starve Together
- **Event:** The Forge

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** That weapon's for throwing.
- **Willow:** That's Woodie's axe.
- **Wolfgang:** Is beard's axe.
- **Wendy:** Hello again, Lucy.
- **WX78:** I HAVE NO USE FOR YOU, AXE
- **Wickerbottom:** Quite the unusual axe.
- **Woodie:** Something's different about you, Lucy.
- **Maxwell:** I have no desire to use that.
- **Wigfrid:** Thy axe is filled with burning passion this day!
- **Webber:** You look different, Lucy. Did you get a haircut?
- **Winona:** I could take a swing at it. Ha!
- **Source:** when examining Riled Lucy in the Forge
- **Choose:** woodie

Riled Lucy is Woodie's starting item in The Forge event. Used as a melee weapon, it deals 20 physical damage to an enemy. Woodie with Wild Lucy equipped attacks one and a half times faster.

Unlike her normal counterpart, the wild Lucy can be picked up by other characters who specialize in melee combat.

Wild Lucy's main ability is Lucy Chuck: Throw Lucy in a given direction, dealing 30 physical damage, provoking the target to throw and breaking the target's armor (a broken shield icon appears above the enemy, and it will be dealt 5-10% more damage). Lucy stays where she fell if she was thrown by any character other than Woodie; if thrown by Woodie, it returns to his hand.

## Prototype Tips
- Only Woodie gets bonuses using Lucy, so it's not recommended to fight Lucy with other characters.
- The increased hitting speed is quite useful in the early game. With it, Woodie can more effectively "tank" enemies than other characters (it is recommended to have well-protective armor).
- Lucy's throw is the perfect distraction for dangerous creatures from the team. With the speed boost gear, you can constantly throw Lucy at the Svinorill without fear of getting hit while the rest of the team clears the arena of other enemies.

- **Spawn Code:** `teleportato_box`

The **Box Thing** is an **Item** and one of four **Things** used on the **Wooden Thing** to travel to the next world. It spawns naturally in every world in its own **Set Piece**. It is surrounded by **Stone Walls** and **Evil Flowers** along with a **Gnome** and **Spear** on a small patch of **Rocky Turf**.

There are two versions of it, one that spawns in **Survival Mode** and one in **Adventure Mode**, that differ from their color schemes. Players can craft a **Divining Rod** to help them track the Box Thing.

The only purpose of the Box Thing is to be used on the Wooden Thing. It's an important gameplay Item and as such it cannot be destroyed or stolen by **Mobs**, e.g. **Krampus** or **Splumonkey**s.

## Description

''Lobster Dinner'' was introduced in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' along the ''[[She Sells Sea Shells]]'' update. It is cooked by adding 1 [[Wobster]] and 1 [[Butter]]. It takes 20 seconds to cook. It restores 37.5 {{Hunger}}, 60 {{Hp}}, and 50 {{Sanity}}, making it one of the best food items to restore both [[Health]] and [[Sanity]].

Adding Ice will result in [[Lobster Bisque]] instead. This recipe has a higher [[Dishes#Priority|Crock Pot Priority]] than Monster Lasagna, therefore it allows using more than one [[Durian]]s as fillers.

It is [[Maxwell]]'s [[Food/DST#Favorite_Food|Favourite Food]] and will restore extra 15 {{Hunger}} when consumed.

## Recipe

### Ingredients

- 1 [[Wobster (DST)]]
- 1 [[Butter]]
- 2 [[Filler]] (cannot be [[Ices|Frozen Value]])

### Tools

- [[Crock Pot]]

### Result

- [[Lobster Dinner]]

## Examples

1. Recipe for Lobster Dinner that extenuates hunger value:
   - 1 [[Wobster (DST)]]
   - 1 [[Butter]]
   - 2 [[Twigs]]
   - Result: [[Lobster Dinner]]

2. Another recipe:
   - 1 [[Wobster (DST)]]
   - 1 [[Butter]]
   - 2 [[Durian]]
   - Result: [[Lobster Dinner]]

## Tips

- Lobster Dinner is a good food choice if the player has a butterfly farm and a reliable source of Wobsters, thanks to its high [[Health]] and [[Sanity]] benefits.
- If Sanity is not an issue, it may be a better idea to instead use the Butter to make [[Waffles]]. Waffles heal the same amount of Health and Hunger (unless you are playing as Maxwell) and uses ingredients that are much more abundant than Wobsters.
- [[Warly]]'s quote for Lobster Dinner in DST has been changed to ''"No place is too remote for some fine dining!"'', likely due to his original quote to Lobster Dinner referencing the setting of ''Shipwrecked''.
