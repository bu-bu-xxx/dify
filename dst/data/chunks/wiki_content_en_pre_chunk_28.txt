# Surfboard

## Exclusivity
Shipwrecked

## Item Info
- **Ingredient 1**: Boards (Multiplier: 1)
- **Ingredient 2**: Seashell (Multiplier: 2)
- **Tab**: Nautical
- **Spawn Code**: "surfboard", "surfboard_item" (item)
- **Name**: Surfboard
- **Tier**: 0
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Durability**: 100
- **Perk**: Sailing Speed: 6.5, Grants 1 Sanity and large speed boost for riding Waves
- **Description**: Cowabunga dudes!

## Quote
> "My love for you is deeper than the ocean." - Walani

## Details
The **Surfboard** is a **Boat** item in the **Shipwrecked** DLC, and is exclusive to **Walani**. Walani starts the game with it in her inventory, and is the only **character** able to craft it. It can be crafted with 1 **Board** and 2 **Seashell**s from the **Nautical Tab**.

It has the highest base movement speed of all **Boats** at 6.5, but also has the lowest durability at 100. It restores 1 **Sanity** to Walani for every **Wave** that she rides correctly, and gives a ×5 (Small Waves) or ×7 (Big Waves) speed boost from riding Waves compared to most other Boats (excluding the **Encrusted Boat**). It will also suffer a ×1.5 **Wetness** penalty and grant no speed boost when hitting Waves incorrectly.

The Surfboard does not require paddling, so Walani can hold tools (including **Torch**es and **Bottle Lantern**s) while surfing. Surfboards can be retrieved from both land and sea and placed into the inventory, thus making it possible to pick up and re-deploy the Surfboard after placing it.

While moving, the Surfboard loses durability at a rate of 1 per 9.6 seconds, lasting a total of 2 days. Sailing on a heavily damaged Surfboard won't increase Wetness.

## Tips
- Riding **Waves** correctly can give a large boost in speed and sanity over time, making Walani much faster when she moves with the current.
- Because it is the only sea-craft capable of riding Big Waves, the Surfboard is often the fastest vessel for Walani during **Hurricane Season**.
- **Purple Grouper** and **Tropical Bouillabaisse**'s effects cause Walani to gain the speed boost and sanity bonuses even from hitting Waves incorrectly, negating the Wetness and damage penalties for doing so.
- **Pierrot Fish** and **Tropical Bouillabaisse** can be used to dry off rapidly if the player is suffering from high Wetness after crashing into a few waves - even during an ongoing storm.
- While the Surfboard does not require prototyping, Boards do require a **Science Machine** to prototype. However, Boards can also be obtained by **Hammer**ing **Crate**s, allowing more Surfboards to be crafted before building a Science Machine.
- If hammered down with a **Hammer** returns one board and one Seashell.

## Bugs
- Using the console to spawn a surfboard for other characters may cause a crash.
- Dropping the Surfboard, or crafting it with a full inventory, while near the edges of land in a Shipwrecked world can cause the Surfboard to fall in the water and sink.
- In **Pocket Edition**, the option to retrieve the Surfboard will not appear, making it more useless to the Player.

## Description
**Lichen** is a **Food** item in **Don't Starve**. It is classified as a **Vegetable**, and can only be obtained in the **Ruins** by harvesting **Cave Lichen**. Lichen cannot be cooked at a **Fire Pit**, **Campfire**, or **Star Caller's Staff**, but it can be used as an ingredient in a **Crock Pot**. Lichen regrows after 5 days.

Lichen can be eaten raw and restores 3 HP and 12.5 Hunger, at the cost of 5 Sanity. The Sanity penalty can be avoided by using it in a Crock Pot instead. The Unagi recipe for the Crock Pot specifically requires Lichen, however, Lichen can also be used as a filler. Lichen spoils very quickly and becomes **Rot** 2 days after being harvested.

As of the **Return of Them|Eye of the Storm** beta, Lichen can be fed to **Beefalo** and **Pigs**.

### Usage
- **Pig Icon**: Lichen produces **Manure** when given to pigs.
- **Crock Pot**: Combines **Lichen**, **Eel**, and two **Fillers** to make **Unagi**.

### Trivia
- Lichen used to be green, but its color was changed in the **Stuff of Nightmares** update.

# Featured
![Caves Playstyle](Caves_Playstyle.png "Caves Playstyle"){: width="200px"}
> "What treasures lie beneath?" - Wigfrid

## Caves
Caves are large underground sections of the world filled with unique features. They are so large that they are generated as whole new maps upon entering. Caves have their own artwork, terrain, and maps. They are home to various creatures, plants, and other objects that do not appear elsewhere.

## Spelunking
![A fully-explored Cave (older map)](CaveMap.jpg "A fully-explored Cave"){: width="300px"}
A Cave can be found underneath a **Plugged Sinkhole**. Upon mining the plug with a **Pickaxe**, an open **Sinkhole** appears with a rope leading down into a new Cave. Each Sinkhole connects to a different Cave. Each Cave is generated just like a new world. A different loading screen (pictured above) will play while it is created. While within a Cave, time in the world above continues to pass and vice versa. However, the **Clock** is removed from the game's HUD while the player is inside a Cave, making it difficult to keep track of the current **Day-Night Cycle**.

Once a Sinkhole is unplugged, **Batilisks** can emerge at **Dusk** and roam the surface world, but will not travel far from the Sinkhole from which they emerged.

When a Sinkhole is entered (or "spelunked"), the player will be dropped into a small circle of light within the Cave, with a rope hanging from above and a skeleton nearby. Interacting with the rope will return the player to the surface world.

The worlds within a Cave are affected by the **Day-Night Cycle**, **Moon Cycle**, and the four **Seasons**. However, Caves are perpetually in darkness. This means that **Sanity** slowly drains while in Caves and, in areas of complete darkness, characters are vulnerable to **Charlie (Night Monster)**. Some natural light may leak in from the surface in certain places, but these sources of light will only appear while it is daytime in the world above. Permanent or semi-permanent light sources can be found from certain objects that naturally occur in Caves, such as **Light Flowers**, **Mushtrees**, or **Nightmare Fissures**. However, since the large majority of areas in Caves are completely dark, players will need to bring their own sources of light to be able to effectively explore.

**Giants** and **Hounds** will not spawn in Caves. If a player skips a hound wave while spelunking, the wave will occur as soon as the player emerges from the cave. If a player skips the spawning of a giant, that giant might also spawn upon resurfacing (sometimes skipping the warm-up "growling" period). Staying in a cave until the season changes will prevent the previous season's giant from attacking in this manner.

## Depths Worm Attacks
In place of Hound and giant attacks, **Depths Worms** will attack the player at intervals similar to the Hound wave attacks on the surface, and will increase in intensity as the days spent in the world increase. Like Hound attacks in the surface, Depths Worms will automatically target the player unless distracted by another mob.

## Earthquakes
**Earthquakes** occur fairly often while the player is within a Cave. When an earthquake strikes, the screen shakes and a rumbling sound plays. **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Nitre**, **Marble**, **Gold Nuggets**, and sometimes **Red Gem** and **Blue Gem** **Gems** will fall from the Cave ceiling. A small shadow will appear where each mineral is about to fall. If struck by a falling mineral, the player will take a small amount of damage. Many of the items that fall during an earthquake shatter when they hit the ground, but some will remain intact and can be collected by the player. Once the earthquake ends, **Slurtles** and **Snurtles** leave their homes and roam the Cave in search of minerals to eat.

## Creatures
![A Bunnyman](Bunnyman.png "A Bunnyman"){: width="80px"}
![A Spitter](Spitter_Build.png "A Spitter"){: width="80px"}
In addition to normal **Spiders**, **Fireflies**, and **Tentacles**, the following creatures reside only in Caves:
- **Cave Spider**
- **Spitter**
- **Batilisk**
- **Bunnyman** / **Beardlord**
- **Slurtle**
- **Snurtle**
- **Rock Lobster**
- **Big Tentacle

### Description
Saplings are small **Plants** found commonly in **Grasslands** and **Forests**. They can be picked to provide 1 **Twig**, after which they will need 4 days to regrow. Saplings can be dug up with a **Shovel** and replanted in a new location (typically closer to a base camp). Saplings can't be planted on **Checkerboard Floorings**, **Wooden Floorings**, **Cobblestones**, **Carpeted Floorings**, **Rocky Turfs**, **Sandy Turfs**, and **Cave Rock Turfs**, unless it has been planted before these **turfs** were placed. Unlike **Grass Tufts** and **Berry Bushes**, Saplings don't require fertilization to regrow after being replanted. This is similar to **Spiky Bushes**, which can be harvested without fertilization.

They are also highly flammable, and may be used as fuel in **Campfires** or **Fire Pits**. When burned on the ground, a Sapling will leave behind 1 **Ashes**. Because they burn easily, Saplings planted close together are very susceptible to **Lightning** strikes. This can be prevented by building **Lightning Rods**. Saplings will not regrow during **Winter**.

Despite their name and **Character quotes** from some characters, Saplings will never grow into **Trees**.

Saplings, along with other items, like **Log Suits**, **Grass Tufts**, and **Boards**, have the longest burn time.

### Downloadable Content
In the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC, Saplings will turn into Withered Saplings during **Summer**. During

## Description
'''Lush Carpet''' is a naturally generated type of [[Turfs|Flooring]] exclusive to ''[[Don't Starve Together]]''. It was added in ''[[A Little Drama and QOL|A Little Drama]]'' update and can be found on the [[Stage]] [[Set Piece]] or on a one tile large [[Briar Wolf|Briar Wolf Set Piece]].

It is an alternative to the regular [[Carpeted Flooring]] and has a dark purple texture. It can also be crafted with one [[Boards|Board]] and one [[Beefalo Wool]] and requires an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype.

## Trivia
* The Last update where a new [[Turfs|turf]] type was added, which is the Ancient Stonework, was ''Turn of the Tides'', released in June 2019. Since then, ''Don't Starve Together'' hadn't received a new turf type. After almost 3 years, however, 10 new turf types were introduced, including the lush carpet.
* Shade of Lush Carpet is the opposite of the regular one. (The latter is bright purple, while its lush variant is dark.)
* Lush carpet shares the same crafting recipe with regular carpeted flooring.

# Floral Shirt

## Overview
The **Floral Shirt**, also known as the **Hawaiian Shirt**, is a craftable **Dress** item from the **Reign of Giants** DLC. It requires 3 **Papyrus**, 3 **Silk**, and 5 **Cactus Flowers** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. It restores 3.3 **Sanity**/min and provides 240 points of protection from **Overheating** while worn.

## Crafting and Spoilage
The **Floral Shirt** spoils after 15 days, similar to the **Fashion Melon** and the **Garland**, instead of losing durability as it's worn, thus it cannot be repaired with a **Sewing Kit**. Storing it inside an **Insulated Pack** or **Snow Chester** will slow its spoilage rate.

## Seasonal Dependence
Since the item requires **Cactus Flowers** to be crafted, it cannot be crafted until the first **Summer**. Unfortunately, it only lasts for 12 days after that, due to the 25% faster spoilage during Summer.

## Shipwrecked DLC
The **Floral Shirt** is also included in the **Shipwrecked** DLC, where it is helpful against **Overheating** during the **Dry Season**. It requires 5 **Petals** to craft instead of 5 **Cactus Flowers**, as **Cacti** are not present in the **Shipwrecked** world.

## Trivia
- The **Floral Shirt** used to be crafted using **Petals**, **Silk**, and **Butterfly Wings**, and it wasn't as effective against **heat**.
- Even though it requires a **Cactus Flower** to craft (suggesting that is the flower on the shirt), typical "Hawaiian" shirts depict the **Hibiscus**, the Hawaiian state flower.

- **Wickerbottom**: Ah... I'm not familiar with this strain of flower.

**Abigail's Flower** is a character-specific item used by **Wendy** to summon the **Ghost** of her twin sister, **Abigail**.

To do so, players need to place Abigail's Flower on the ground. A mob death near the flower is necessary for Abigail to spawn. However, if Abigail "dies" and despawns into a flower and the mobs die (or Wendy kills something) around the flower after the cooldown period, Abigail will not spawn unless the flower is picked up first and then placed down near a death occurring.

Summoning Abigail drains **Sanity** by 50 points. When she "dies", she will drop the flower so Wendy can spawn her again after the cooldown period has expired. Note that one hit from the player will kill her and she can often be targeted unexpectedly by the player during battle.

The flower has three stages of blooming. Initially, it will start as a pale, closed flower. Once charged, it becomes a more reddish pink color and is in bloom. In the third stage, when ready for the blood sacrifice, it will levitate slightly above the ground. Abigail's Flower does not need to be in the player's inventory to bloom, so it may be left at the player's base in lieu of inventory space while it (re-)charges. Abigail's Flower is also visible from the map screen, making it easy to relocate should the player accidentally lose track of it. If the flower somehow falls into the ocean, it will disappear like a normal item and will re-spawn near the player.

In situations where Abigail somehow ends up following a player character other than Wendy (e.g. by completing an Adventure Mode run), Abigail will continue to follow the new character around in **Sandbox Mode** but will not drop the flower upon dying.

## Trivia

- There is a **The Forge** exclusive **Profile Icons** depicting Abigail's Flower. According to the icon's flavor text, this flower is Wendy's only remaining keepsake of Abigail.
- In the animated short **Next of Kin**, a picture of Abigail's Flower can be seen pinned on a board that connects various people, places, and events to Charlie's disappearance.
- Prior to Wendy's character refresh, Abigail's Flower could be crafted for 6 **Petals** and 1 **Nightmare Fuel** in **Don't Starve Together**.
- Prior to Wendy's character refresh, Abigail's Flower could turn into a normal flower or petal (depending on turf/tiles) if left on the ground for 1440 seconds (3 days).
- In the singleplayer game, Abigail's Flower appears in your inventory when you enter the caves if it isn't already present.
- Abigail's Flower can be found in **Terraria** as a weapon added as part of the **Terraria** x **Don't Starve Together** crossover update.

# Chef Pouch

## Overview
- **Image**: ![Chef Pouch](Chef Pouch Dropped.png)
- **Equip Slot**: Body
- **Icon**: ![Chef Pouch Icon](Chef Pouch.png)
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Scrapbook Description**: A 6 slots container that slows the spoiling of items inside.
- **Name**: Chef Pouch
- **Ingredients**:
  - Cloth: 1
  - Rope: 1 (Warly Portrait only)
- **Tab**: Survival
- **Tier**: 0
- **Perk**: +8 inventory slots, Contents receive 50% spoilage rate
- **Spawn Code**: "spicepack"
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Description**: Freshen up your foodstuffs.

## Exclusivity
- Exclusive to **Shipwrecked** in **Don't Starve Together**.

## Quotes
- Wilson: A breakthrough in culinary science!
- Willow: I'm sure Warly won't mind if I borrow this.
- Wolfgang: Wolfgang will carry all the food!
- Wendy: To fend off the ravages of decay... for my food at least.
- WX-78: EFFICIENT STORAGE FOR ORGANIC MATTER
- Wickerbottom: This should keep my provisions from spoiling!
- Woodie: A handy knapsack for conserving food!
- Maxwell: I've been reduced to hauling my own foodstuffs.
- Wigfrid: I'll use this to carry delicious meats!
- Webber: I'm sure Mr. Warly won't mind if we use this!
- Winona: Say, this is some fine bit of engineering!
- Warly: My bag of chef's tricks!
- Wortox: What a cute little pack. Hyuyu!
- Wormwood: Pack for belly stuff!
- Wurt: Keep foods inside!
- Walter: Specialized spice traveling gear.
- Wanda: I wonder if it makes time slow down, or if it's just well insulated.

## Details
The Chef Pouch, also known as the Spice Pack, is a character-specific item that Warly begins the game with. He can also craft it from the Survival Tab using Cloth and Rope.

It has eight inventory slots and acts similarly to an Insulated Pack; items inside will spoil two times slower. Despite slowing the spoilage of Food Items, the Chef Pouch does not completely work the same way as an Ice Box. Unlike the Box, the Chef Pouch will not stop the spoilage of Hail, Ice, and Ice Cubes and will not be able to freeze a Thermal Stone. It can also carry items other than perishables.

It cannot be placed in the Inventory and will be dropped on the ground when not equipped. Any Item clicked on a Chef Pouch which is on the ground will give the 'Store' option, allowing the pack to be filled without equipping it. It is flammable. Although it looks like a hat, the Chef Pouch is equipped on the body slot.

## Trivia
- The Chef Pouch was added in the Eye of the Tiger Shark update to Shipwrecked.
- Prior to the Release The Quacken update, the Chef Pouch only had four inventory slots.
- When the player begins a Don't Starve game as Warly, the Chef Pouch is actually dropped nearby, implying that it is supposed to go into the player's Inventory, but fails, as backpacks cannot be held in the Inventory.

## Tips
- The speed bonus stacks with the Walking Cane or The Lazy Explorer, for a total increase of 45% movement speed (88.5% on Roads). This can be further stacked with overloaded WX-78's.
- Unlike Lanterns, Miner Hats, etc., Magiluminescences are destroyed when durability reaches 0%, so extra care is needed to prevent their loss.
- If players plan on keeping a Magiluminescence equipped at all times for the speed boost, it will cost them roughly 2.7 Nightmare Fuel per day. That means a stack of 40 for seasons that last 15 days, and 54 for those that last 20. It is not advised to keep it equipped while not traversing big distances, like when crafting multiple items or harvesting from Farms, since the advantage in movement speed is negligible for too much cost.

## Trivia
- When placed on the ground, the Magiluminescence used to glow and not lose any durability. As of the A Moderately Friendly Update, they will no longer glow when dropped on the ground.
- The Magiluminescence shares the same in-game model with the Nightmare Amulet, but its gem is yellow instead of purple.
- This is the only light-emitting item that can be equipped in the chest slot.
- Before the Release the Quacken update for Shipwrecked, Magiluminescence could not be refueled with Nightmare Fuel. This change was applied to the other game versions too.
- Magiluminescence has been refuelable with Nightmare Fuel in Don't Starve Together since the update Rev. 172848 on April 7, 2016.
- Wickerbottom states the amulet glows at "mid 530 nanometer

The Toadstool has the ability to attach a Spore Bomb to any player within 10 range, providing a bit of light until it explodes into a Spore Cloud 3.5 seconds later, which lingers for 1 minute and damages players as long as they are in it. The Spore Cloud will also rapidly spoil any perishable item within its area. A player fighting with a Ham Bat has to be careful not to be in range of the Spore Cloud on the ground.

## Scrapbook Info
Can be placed on dirt ground to change the type of ground.

**Wooden Flooring** is a craftable **Turf** **Item**. It requires 1 **Board** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. It can also be found underneath a **Pig King** or near **Touch Stone**s. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as **Fuel**. To place the wooden flooring (or any kind of flooring), you will need to use a **pitchfork** to plow the ground where you want to place it.

**Eyeplants** cannot spawn on this Turf, making it the cheapest artificial way of protecting oneself from **Lureplants**. Plants like **Berry Bush**es, **Grass Tuft**s, **Sapling**s, **Spiky Bush**s, **Pine Cone**s, and **Birchnut**s can't be planted on these turfs, unless these were planted before the turfs were placed.

When placed on the **Surface World** in a large enough area, Crows are the only **Birds** that will spawn and land on these turfs.

Despite being made out of wood, Wooden Flooring is not flammable when placed, meaning the player can place **Campfires** and **Fire Pits** on it as normal.

## Trivia
* Wooden Flooring strongly resembles the flooring in Wilson's own home as seen in **Forbidden Knowledge**.

# Booty Bag

## Exclusivity
**Shipwrecked**

## Item Infobox
- **Stack**: Can't be held in the inventory
- **Perk**: +8 inventory slots  
  Drops a [[Dubloon]] up to once per [[day]]
- **Spawn Code**: "piratepack"
- **Equip Slot**: body
- **Dropped By**: [[Quacken]], [[X Marks The Spot]], Found in [[Ocean]]

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: I can keep my booty in here.
- **Willow**: Carrying this will build chest muscles.
- **Wolfgang**: Sounds like jingles.
- **Wendy**: This should help me carry more junk.
- **WX-78**: PIRATES MUST HAVE STRONG CORE CONSTRUCTION

- **Woodlegs**: Me thought me lost thet!
- **Wilba**: 'TIS A PIRATOUS SACK
- **Wormwood**: Stuff!
- **Wheeler**: Storage space that pays for itself!
- **Choose**: Walani

The **Booty Bag** is a type of [[Backpack]] introduced in the **[[Shipwrecked]]** DLC. It can be found floating in the **[[Ocean]]** in a random location, by digging up an **[[X Marks the Spot]]**, or as a reward for defeating the **[[Quacken]]**. In addition to providing 8 slots of storage, the Booty Bag generates a **[[Dubloon]]** up to once per **[[day]]** while being continuously worn.

Dubloons fall from the Booty Bag into the environment instead of being generated inside the Booty Bag. Dubloons will drop only after it has been equipped continuously for a day, and removing the Booty Bag even temporarily resets this wait time.

Players should be cautious around open flames or lightning when the Booty Bag is on the ground, as like the Backpack, it's a flammable item. As with the Backpack, any flammable items inside of it will be burnt to ashes upon it being burnt, dropping the rest on the spot.

## Tips
- This item is particularly good for **[[Woodlegs]]** since his **[[Lucky Hat]]** requires 10 Dubloons.

# Cowl

## Item Infobox
- **Exclusivity:** Hamlet
- **Equip Slot:** Head
- **Description:** Harness the power of sonar.
- **Ingredient 1:** Pig Skin (Multiplier: 2)
- **Ingredient 2:** Batilisk Wing (Multiplier: 1)
- **Ingredient 3:** Compass (Multiplier: 1)
- **Tab:** Light
- **Tier:** 2
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** "bathat"
- **Durability:** 2 Days
- **Perk:** Provides sonar-based night and fog vision. Allows a chest slot item to be worn in fog with no speed penalty.

The **Cowl** is a craftable Hat Item exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It is found in the Light Tab, requires two Pig Skins, a Batilisk Wing, and a Compass to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

## Description
The Cowl provides the player a sonar-based night vision when worn. Every 5 seconds, it will produce some sonar waves, which will illuminate the player's screen with black-light (very similar to the Moggles), that will allow the player to see the entire screen for a short time. Then, over these 5 seconds, this light will progressively fade away, acting just like it was truly sound-based. Unlike Moggles, this item cannot be refueled, so the player will have to craft a new one once it runs out of durability.

During Humid Season, when worn, fog will not slow down the player, similar in function to the Pith Hat. It also allows the player to wear something in their chest slot, and not suffer the slowing effect. Furthermore, it allows the player to see through fog, unlike Moggles.

## Quotes
- Wilson: A hat, made of bat.
- Willow: Ugh. I can still smell the jerkiness.

# Strident Trident

Exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, the Strident Trident is a weapon introduced in the **Return of Them** update. The blueprint for the Strident Trident is dropped by the Crab King upon death. It requires the following ingredients to craft:

- 3 Gnarwail Horns
- 4 Kelp Fronds
- 2 Twigs

## Description

The Strident Trident can be used as a melee weapon to deal 51 damage on land and 76.5 damage in the Ocean with 200 uses. It can also cast spells, consuming 4 weapon uses (for a maximum of 50 casts). The spell summons geysers in the Ocean around the cast location, dealing 85 damage. It can mine for the equivalent of 10 Pickaxe hits, push Items away from the cast location, uproot Bull Kelp, and launch fish into the air to catch them without a Sea Fishing Rod.

## Quotes

- Wilson: *"This is going to be a blast!"*
- Willow: *"It's three times as pokey."*
- Wolfgang: *"Is good fork for Wolfgang-sized meals!"*
- Wendy: *"It was stolen from the sea, but it still holds power over the waves."*
- WX-78: *"HIGH FREQUENCY TABLEWARE"*
- Wickerbottom: *"It produces quite literal sound waves!"*
- Woody: *"Don't worry Lucy, I'm not trading you in anytime soon."*
- Maxwell: *"It seems to have struck a chord."*
- Wigfrid: *"I shall lay waste to my enemies with the weapon of Poseidon!"*
- Webber: *"We don't know how to play, but we can try!"*
- Winona: *"I ain't afraid to make waves! Ha!"*
- Warly: *"What dish could accommodate a fork of that size?"*
- Wortox: *"Holding a pitchfork feels disturbingly natural."*
- Wormwood: *"Pokey"*
- Wurt: *"Pokey poke!"*
- Walter: *"This looks like it could cause some damage."*
- Wanda: *"It makes such a racket!"*

## Tips

- With its higher damage in the Ocean, it is advised that a player only uses it while sailing.
- The trident's cast can also be used to mine Salt Formations in the ocean and kill nearby Cookie Cutters.
- After two Gnarwail horns have been collected, the trident can be crafted with a Construction Amulet. Using a Deconstruction Staff on a trident before its durability hits 33% will return two horns.

## Trivia

- The Strident Trident was introduced in the "She Sells Sea Shells" update.
- It shares the same debug spawn name as the Shipwrecked item Trident. However, its appearance and mechanics differ.
- Despite being a trident, when its spell is cast, a character using it appears to strum it like an electric guitar. It even produces a similar sound.
- Wortox's quote is a reference to demons often being depicted with pitchforks, as he is an imp.

Moggles are [[Category:Hats|Headwear]] from the [[Reign of Giants]] DLC. They are found in the [[Light Tab]], require 2 [[Moleworm]]s, 2 [[Electrical Doodad]]s, and 1 [[Glow Berry]] to craft and an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype.

When worn, the player is able to see in the dark with a sort of negative filter. If the player wears the Moggles when there is light outside, their surroundings appear extremely bright. Unlike other [[light]] items, Moggles allow the player to see everything on the screen.

Moggles will last for one and a half days in total but can be recharged using [[Glow Berries]], which will restore their durability by 33.25% (almost 4 minutes), or [[Lesser Glow Berry|Lesser Glow Berries]], which will restore their durability by 6.25% (45 seconds).

Despite not being a light source in the conventional sense, wearing Moggles will protect players from [[Charlie]].

## Downloadable Content
In the [[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]] DLC, Moggles cannot be crafted but can be brought over from a connected [[Reign of Giants]] world. In [[Shipwrecked]], they can be refueled with [[Dragoon Heart]]s, restoring 33.25% of their durability similar to Glow Berries.

In the [[Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet]] DLC, Moggles cannot be crafted. Instead, they can be bought for 20 [[Oinc]]s at [[The Sow's Ear Hat Shop]] at the [[Pig City]].

## Tips
- Moggles are the only portable means of acquiring 100% visibility at night or underground.
- The [[Hamlet]] DLC introduces the [[Cowl]], which also provides 100% visibility, using sonar-type vision.
- Moggles can be particularly useful when dealing with [[Cave Spider]]s and [[Spitter]]s.
- They are especially handy when exploring the [[Ruins]] since the player is able to spot danger and prepare for the lying monsters in wait.
- Moggles will be destroyed if they reach 0% so the player should make sure to un-equip or refuel them

# Krampus Sack

## Overview
The **Krampus Sack** is a **Backpack** item with unique properties. It is an extremely rare drop from **Krampus**, with only a 1% chance to drop from their small loot table. In **Don't Starve Together**, it has a 10% chance to drop from bundled supplies received from **Klaus**'s **Loot Stash**.

## Features
- **Inventory Slots**: 14, which is 6 more than a **Backpack** and 2 more than a **Piggyback**.
- **Stacking**: Does not stack.
- **Dropped By**: 
  - **Krampus** (1%)
  - **Loot Stash** (10%)
- **Perk**: +14 inventory slots.
- **Spawn Code**: `krampus_sack`

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "Ew. It has Krampus slime all over it."
- **Willow**: "The holidays came early this year!"
- **Wolfgang**: "I have goat man's sack."
- **Wendy**: "It smells of goat."
- **WX-78**: "STORAGE MODULE 2.0"
- **Wickerbottom**: "It seems bigger inside than out."
- **Woodie**: "I feel bad taking someone else's sack."
- **Maxwell**: "It's really light."
- **Wagstaff**: "Holds more supplies but weighs less than a backpack. It defies all known laws of physics!"
- **Wigfrid**: "I can fit everything in here!"
- **Webber**: "We could put more in but we're scared to touch the stuff he left inside."
- **Walani**: "A bag of stolen goods."
- **Warly**: "Infinite pocket space!"
- **Woodlegs**: "Woodlegs'll ne'er leave treasure behind again!"
- **Wilba**: "BELONGETH TO WILBA NOW!"
- **Wheeler**: "A treasure trove of extra storage!"

- **Wortox**: "He should have known I would not hold back."
- **Wurt**: "It jingles!"
- **Walter**: "It smells... goat-y."
- **Wanda**: "For me? You shouldn't have!"

## Tips for Obtaining Krampus Sack
1. **Spawning Krampus**: A quick way to spawn and farm Krampus is by killing a **Glommer**, so players should take advantage of every full moon cycle to retrieve the **Glommer's Flower** and kill the Glommer in an area where any spawned Krampus will quickly die. Neutral mobs will be aggressive towards Krampus, so a **Pig** or **Bunnyman** village would be an ideal location to kill a Glommer.
2. **Moonstorm**: When **Moonstorm** is active, every day will be full moon, this means players can kill Glommer every day to farm Krampus.
3. **Hamlet DLC**: In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, spawning **Krampii** can be easily achieved by building and robbing banks (**Town House**). One might want to use a **Pan Flute** to put the **banker** to sleep, and grab his items. The player should build a new bank, and repeat the process. Two bank heists will result in a Krampus spawn.

## Trivia
- The Krampus Sack was added in the **Naughty and Nice** update. Before the **Underground** update, the Krampus Sack didn't appear as an icon on the map.
- When Krampus wears the Krampus Sack, there are no chains surrounding the Sack, while the item obtained from killing Krampus has two chains draped across it. When worn, a faint jingling sound from the chains can be heard while the player is moving.

## Gallery
- Original HD icon from Bonus Materials from **CD Don't Starve**.
- Various characters wearing the Krampus Sack: Wilson, Willow, Wolfgang, Wendy, WX-78, Wickerbottom, Woodie, Wes, Maxwell, Wigfrid, Webber, Walani, Warly, Wilbur, Woodlegs, Wilba, Wormwood, Wheeler, Winona, Wortox, Wurt.

# Thulecite Club

## Equipment Details
- **Slot**: Hands
- **Icon**: Thulecite Club.png
- **Image**: Thulecite Club Dropped.png
- **Ingredients**:
  - **Living Log**: 3
  - **Thulecite**: 4
  - **Nightmare Fuel**: 4
- **Spawn Code**: "ruins_bat"
- **Damage**: 59.5
- **Durability**: 200 uses
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Tab**: Ancient
- **Tier**: 6
- **Perk**: Summon Shadow Tentacles on hit, Increases movement speed by 10%

## Crafting
The Thulecite Club is a craftable item found in the Ancient Tab. It requires 3 Living Logs, 4 Thulecite, 4 Nightmare Fuel, and an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. It also has an 8.3% chance to be found inside a Large Ornate Chest. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Thulecite Clubs cannot be prototyped, and characters always need to be near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft them again.

## Usage
When equipped in the hand slot, the Thulecite Club can be used as a Weapon that deals 59.5 damage per hit and increases movement speed by 10%. The Thulecite Club loses 0.67% of its Durability with each hit, meaning it has 200 uses before breaking.

When attacking with a Thulecite Club, there is a 20% chance that a Shadow Tentacle will spawn from the ground, which lasts for 9 seconds attacking enemies within its range. Shadow Tentacles have the same stats as normal Tentacles, except for a more limited attack range. Shadow Tentacles lower Sanity by 40 sanity per minute when close just like normal ones. The Shadow Tentacles cannot be targeted.

Since Thulecite is not renewable, only a limited number of Thulecite Clubs can be crafted in the base game.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, players have a small chance of finding Green Gems inside Tumbleweeds, thus making Thulecite Clubs renewable, since more Thulecite can be gained with the use of Construction Amulets and Deconstruction Staffs.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, Thulecite Clubs, along with Thulecite Crowns and Thulecite Suits, can be obtained from the Slot Machine as a possible reward. An X Marks the Spot treasure chest found through a Message in a Bottle also has a chance to contain these items. Since Dubloons required to obtain loot from the Slot Machine are renewable, Thulecite equipment is also renewable in Shipwrecked. Also, after killing the Quacken, the chest may contain Thulecite club and armor.

## Tips
- Shadow Tentacles are stationary and have a limited attack range. That means that they will not be very useful against fast-moving enemies but will provide a good advantage against slow or stationary ones.
- Since they're both top-tier Weapons, the Thulecite Club and Dark Sword are often compared with each other. While the Dark Sword does more direct damage than the Thulecite Club, the total damage from the Club and the Shadow Tentacles can potentially be higher. The Thulecite Club will also last longer than a Dark Sword (200 uses versus 100 in durability, although more expensive) and the Shadow Tentacles drain more Sanity than the sword, but only if the player is standing close to them.
- A way to gain sanity in DST is to combine a Thulecite Club with a Bee Queen Crown, because the Crown will convert the Sanity loss of the Shadow Tentacles into +20 sanity per minute (Instead of -40 per minute), and it also provides defense (70%) at the same time.

## Trivia
- The Thulecite Club was added in the "The Stuff of Nightmares" update.
- The Thulecite Club is very similar to an Aztec weapon called the macuahuitl, which has been reported to cut off a horse's head in a single blow due to the sharpness of its obsidian blades. Many of the Ruins items appear to be based around Aztec or Olmec art.
- In older versions of Don't Starve, Shadow Tentacles always spawned when attacking.
- Webber's quote is a reference to Queen's song, "We Will Rock You."

# Stalking Stick

**Exclusive to:** Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC  
**Slot:** Hands  
**Image:** ![Stalking Stick](Stalking%20Stick.png)  
**Damage:** 20.4  
**Durability:** 3 days (as a Walking Tool)  
**Perk:** 30% faster movement speed  
**Stacking:** Does not stack  
**Spawn Code:** "walkingstick"

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Perfect for a gentleman scientist."
- Willow: "Zoom!"
- Wolfgang: "Is for good walk steps."
- Wendy: "I am destined to walk this earth alone."
- WX-78: "ACCELERATOR"
- Wickerbottom: "Improves one's posture."
- Woodie: "Just out for a rip."
- Maxwell: "Much easier on my knees."
- Wagstaff: "Incredible! It increases my speed by exactly thirty percent!"
- Wigfrid: "Tö assist in mine löngest jöurney."

- Woodlegs: "Moor legs mean moor walkin'."
- Wilba: "‘TIS A STICK O' ZOOMIES"
- Wormwood: "Wheee!"
- Wheeler: "Dried flytrap stalks really put a spring in my step."  

## Description
The **Stalking Stick** is an equippable Item exclusive to the **Hamlet** DLC. Similar to the **Walking Cane**, it is a speed-increasing item that can also be used as a weapon. Crafted by drying a **Flytrap Stalk** on a **Drying Rack**, it increases character movement speed by 30% while equipped, which is 5 percent points faster than the Walking Cane. It has a durability of three in-game days and can be repaired to 100% durability by a **Sewing Kit**.

The Stalking Stick can also be used while sailing on **Boats**, providing the same speed boost.

## Tips
- The Stalking Stick may be used as a weapon, although it is among the weakest in the game, dealing only a little more than half the damage of a Spear. However, using it as a weapon does not drain its durability.  
- The Stalking Stick's speed boost puts the character on the same level as many other creatures who could otherwise outrun them, including followers like Chester. This is amplified by both natural **Road**, **Stone Road** and **Cobblestone**, for a combined increase of movement speed by 60%, allowing players to outrun most mobs in the game.  
- One can stack the speed bonus with **Magiluminescence** to have a total increase of 50% movement speed while both items are worn, which means that while on a road, the player will have an 80% speed boost. This can further be increased with **WX-78**'s overload, **Wolfgang**'s mighty speed boost, or **Wilbur**'s, **Wheeler**'s, and Blooming **Wormwood**'s speed boost, or after eating **Coffee**, **Tropical Bouillabaisse**, **Iced Tea**, and/or **Tea**.

## Recipe
**Ingredients:**
- 1x Flytrap Stalk  
- 1x Drying Rack  
**Result:** Stalking Stick

## Trivia
- The Stalking Stick used to not be flammable before the February 13, 2019 update.
