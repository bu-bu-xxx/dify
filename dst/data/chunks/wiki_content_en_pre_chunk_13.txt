The Watch Towers can be deconstructed using a **Deconstruction Staff** for 4 **Pig Skins**, 2 **Halberds** and 3 **Cut Stones**.

Upon entering the Palace, the player will find **Queen Malfalfa** wandering about her Throne Room as well as an exit door. To the left is a room containing the **Royal Gallery**. A second room to the left, serving as a Souvenir Shop, contains multiple **Post Cards of the Royal Palace** on shelves, multiple silver crown replicas (currently titled "Queen Malfalfa") in glass displays and, if the player has not already unlocked her, **Wilba**.

# Cracked Pillars

## Overview
Cracked Pillars are naturally spawning structures exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the **Wilson Rework Update**. They appear at the first day of the world in the **Muddy Biome** in the **Caves**, along with the **Nightmare Werepig** that is chained in place.

## Properties
- **Tool Required**: Can be mined using a **Pickaxe**.
- **Image Gallery**:
  ![Full](Cracked Pillar.png)
  ![Medium](Cracked Pillar Medium.png)
  ![Low](Cracked Pillar Low.png)
  ![Lowest](Cracked Pillar Lowest.png)
- **Spawn Code**: `daywalker_pillar`
- **Drops**:
  - `Marble` x3 (from Pickaxe)
  - `Dreadstone` x3-4, `Marble` (50% chance) (from Nightmare Werepig)

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "There's something glinting inside the marble."
- **Willow**: "How crazy would I have to be to try and break that pillar?"
- **Wolfgang**: "Mighty Wolfgang could break pillar!"
- **Wendy**: "We are all tethered to this place in one way or another."
- **WX-78**: "STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY COMPROMISED"
- **Wickerbottom**: "How odd... the marble appears to be encasing something."
- **Woodie**: "Looks sturdy... ish."
- **Maxwell**: "I can just make out something dark within."
- **Wigfrid**: "The pillar is weakened... mayhaps it could be broken."
- **Webber**: "We feel bad just leaving him like that..."
- **Winona**: "That marble doesn't look structurally sound to me."
- **Warly**: "Perhaps I could free the poor creature?"
- **Wortox**: "A terrible fate, to be locked in this state."
- **Wormwood**: "Where you grow from?"
- **Wurt**: "Heehee, stinky Pig all locked up!"
- **Walter**: "Hey, what's that stuff inside?"
- **Wanda**: "They seem breakable... but I don't think that'd be wise."
- **Choose**: Wanda

## Mechanics
- The Cracked Pillars possess a layer of **Marble** that can be mined to expose the **Dreadstone** that prevents the Nightmare Werepig from moving.
- Hitting an exposed Cracked Pillar with a strong mining tool will cause it to vibrate for a short period of time, which will loosen its chain. Making all Cracked Pillars vibrate at the same time frees the Nightmare Werepig and initiates the boss fight.
- Tools that work to vibrate the Pillars:
  - Pick/Axe
  - Brightshade Smasher
  - Woodie as Werebeaver with **The Werebeaver III** Skill

## Defeat and Reappearance
- The Nightmare Werepig's ground slam attack is the only thing that can ultimately destroy the Cracked Pillars, dropping 3-4 Dreadstones and 1 Marble with a 50% chance.
- After defeating the Nightmare Werepig, the **Scrappy Werepig** can be found in Teetering Junk Pile on the surface after 10 days. The player has to defeat the Scrappy Werepig and wait for another 10 days for the Cracked Pillar set piece and Nightmare Werepig to reappear in the Muddy Biome.

# Spiky Trees

- **Spawn Code**: "marsh_tree"

## Quotes

- Wolfgang: "Is spiky."
- Wendy: "A tree that knows only pain."
- WX-78: "A SPIKY TREE"
- Wickerbottom: "A mangal rhizophora."

- Wurt: "Shouldn't play too close to those, florp."
- Walter: "Not a good tree for climbing."
- Wanda: "What a gnarled old tree."
- Choose: Webber

## Description
Spiky Trees are found only in the Marsh. Instead of dropping Logs when chopped like other trees, Spiky Trees drop Twigs with only a 20% chance to drop a Log. These trees do not have a life-cycle (changing size over time), and there is no way to replant them. Like other trees, the stumps of the Spiky variety can be dug up with a Shovel or Regal Shovel to get an additional log.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Spiky Trees can also be found in the Desert biome.

## Bugs
- When chopping down a burning tree (not one that has already burnt) with an Axe of any kind or as a Werebeaver, the game will sometimes crash, but when it doesn't, the tree will drop as many Logs and Pine Cones as listed above using only 1% of the Axe, as if it was a burnt tree. This bug was fixed in the RoG DLC.
- When dying near a tree, items will sometimes land on top of it in an unreachable location.
- When rapidly chopping down a tree with left click, sometimes the player's Axe will say 0% and take up one inventory space. This can also happen when fighting a mob such as a spider.

# Tentacle Spike

## Overview
The **Tentacle Spike** is a **Melee Weapon**. It is a purple tentacle with spikes protruding from one end, similar to a spiked mace. It has a 50% chance to drop from **Tentacles**, which are found in **Marshes** and **Caves**, or **Big Tentacles**, which are found only in Caves. If a Big Tentacle has already dropped one, no other Big Tentacles can drop them for the rest of the **Day**.

## Properties
- **Durability**: 100 uses
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Damage**: 51
- **Equip Slot**: Hands
- **Icon**: ![Tentacle Spike](Tentacle Spike.png)

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: It's pointy and slimy.
- **Wendy**: Sharp, slimy, and dangerous.
- **WX-78**: THIS IS VICIOUSLY VISCOUS
- **Woodie**: It wobbles when you wave it.

## Drops
- **Tentacle** (50%)
- **Big Tentacle** (50%)
- **Quacken Tentacle** (5%)

## Tips
- As Marshes tend to have Tentacles aggro against the other dangerous mobs of the biome, it is a good idea to check back every so often for free Tentacle Spikes in the day time, given the high drop rate of the weapon and its inability to get stolen/eaten by other mobs.

## Trivia
- The Tentacle Spike used to have a value of 1-10 **Research Points** depending on its durability.
- Before the **Hamlet** DLC, the Tentacle Spike used to sink, and the only way to retrieve it was by using a **Trawl Net**.

- Salt Licks are considered to be part of A New Reign, even though they were introduced before the official start of the beta branch.

## Description
Jungle Trees are a type of Tree found only in the Jungle biome in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. They are by far the largest trees. When chopped down they yield Logs and Jungle Tree Seeds. Chopping any size Jungle Tree has a 50% chance of trying to spawn Snakes. While there is a chance to get no snakes, a maximum of 1 to 3 Snakes can be spawned depending on the size of the Tree. After Day 3, Poison Snakes can be encountered this way. If the medium-sized and fully grown Jungle Trees didn't try to spawn Snakes (even if no Snakes were actually spawned), they will spawn a food item. This food item for medium-sized Jungle Trees is always an Egg, while fully grown Jungle Trees drop either Eggs or Bananas with equal likelihood. Like most trees, the player may use a Shovel to dig up the stump to obtain an extra Log.

- **Choose**: Warly

## Description
The **Gnat Mound** is a naturally spawning object introduced in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It is found in the **Painted** **biome**, and spawns a **Gnat Swarm**.

It takes 6 hits with a **Pickaxe** or **Opulent Pickaxe** to be completely destroyed. Each 2 hits, some **Rocks**, **Iron Ore**, or more rarely, **Flint** will be yielded, and the Gnat Mound will visibly go down a tier, similar to **Mini Glacier**s.

**Gnat Mounds** are able to spawn **Gnat Swarm**s every 120 seconds, and are also created by them. When a Gnat Mound is completely destroyed, the Gnat Swarm that was originated from will rebuild another Mound, if and only if this Gnat Swarm hasn't been recently killed. A new Mound will be made at the lowest tier, and then "repaired" by the Gnats Swarm over time. Gnat Swarms will also repair their mound if damaged, but not completely destroyed. Gnat Mounds try not to spawn Gnat Swarms when **Rain**ing.

Despite being made of Rock, the Gnat Mound is flammable, and will drop **Ash** when burned down or mined while burning.

The Gnat Mound is considered a structure and will be targeted by the **BFB** if it lands near one.

## Tips
- As **Gnat Swarm**s are able to rebuild a destroyed Gnat Mound, a good strategy is to carry a Gnat Swarm in Swinesbury City after destroying their Mound, and wait for them to rebuild another. This way, Rocks and Iron Ore will be easy to get, and renewable.
- It's possible to carry **Gnat Swarm** to connected worlds in order to create new Gnat Mounds, making **Iron Ore** renewable outside of Hamlet worlds.

# Codex Umbra

## Overview
The **Codex Umbra** is a character-exclusive item that Maxwell starts the game with. It can also be crafted, only by him, in the Magic Filter and Survivor Items Filter, using two Papyrus, two Nightmare Fuel and costing 50 Health. It has a durability of 20 uses and does not break if it reaches 0%. Nightmare Fuel repairs 25% durability. It has a UI for choosing to summon between Shadow Servants, Duelists, Sneaks and Prisons. Creating puppets lower max sanity by 15% and he can hold up to 6 Puppets at a time. The Shadow Sneak can be used to transform Rabbits, Bunnymen, and Splumonkeys into their nightmare variants, regardless of how much sanity the Players have, while the Shadow Prison can trap enemies in a temporary cage, making them unable to move.

## Origin
The Codex Umbra was discovered by William Carter in August of 1904. At the time, William was aboard a train heading to San Francisco, California from New York City. The train crashed into a broken down circus wagon, and a man of William's description was reported missing but assumed dead. However, William survived the crash with only a few injuries. While wandering across the desert, he discovered an ancient codex and was intrigued by the "terrifying" possibilities it offered.

## Trivia
- Codex Umbra is Latin for "shadow manuscript".
- It's possible for the Codex Umbra to be set alight and burn into ashes. The book will re-appear in Maxwell's inventory upon re-loading the world.
- If using the Codex Umbra reduces Maxwell's health to zero, the Morgue will list the cause of death as "Shenanigans".
- Like Abigail's Flower, the Codex Umbra floats when placed on the ground, but only if the corresponding Maxwell is nearby. If he moves out of range, the book will close and fall to the ground.
- In the beta test of Maxwell's rework, when using the Codex Umbra, in addition to 4 items that were included in the final version of the update, it was possible to select a spell that allows you to turn the Top Hat in your inventory into a Magician's Top Hat.
- Even after Maxwell's rework, dropped Codex Umbra still opens when Maxwell is nearby like in the original Don't Starve. It doesn't provide any functions though.

## Bugs
- Despite being a starting character specific item, the Codex Umbra can be stolen by mobs like Krampus or Eyeplants.
- Using a Sinkhole to enter the Caves or Ruins without the Codex Umbra can sometimes cause

# Dragonfly Boat

![Dragonfly Boat](Dragonfly Boat.png)

### Repair
The Dragonfly Boat can be repaired using the following items:
- Boat Patch
- Tree Jam
- Driftwood Piece
- Log
- Living Log
- Twigs
- Boards

The Dragonfly Boat has a health of 200 Hull and is created by a Dragonfly Boat Kit. It can hold multiple players and structures. It spawns with the code "dragonboat_body" and is exclusive to "Don't Starve Together". Damage is taken by colliding with Sea Stacks, Salt Formations, coasts, or the border of the world. Leaks can be repaired with Boat Patches, Kelp Patches, Trusty Tape, or Tree Jams. When Hull reaches 0, it will not drop anything.

Being smaller, only 4 Bumpers can be placed around the Dragonfly Boat, and they will prevent collision from all angles like 8 bumpers on a regular Boat.

## Dragonfly Boat Kit

![Dragonfly Boat Kit](Dragonfly Boat Kit Dropped.png)
![Icon](Dragonfly Boat Kit.png)

## Description
Nettle Vine is a plant exclusive to the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. It can be harvested without the need of a tool, and will provide one Nettle. Nettle Vine has four states, but only one of these could make it grow. Nettle Vine does not grow and will wither during Winter.

Nettle Vines will only bloom when they have 20+ Wetness value and are fully grown. At the time of world generation, Nettle Vines are already fully grown. As such, they can be harvested as soon as their wetness reaches the required value, which happens easily during the Heavy Fog and Rain of the Humid Season. However, once Nettle Vines have been harvested or replanted, they must be kept above 20 wetness for a combined total of three days (or Wickerbottom's Applied Horticulture) to be fully grown again. Once a vine has fully grown, it can be harvested at any time while wet. The practical way to regrow harvested Nettle Vines is with the use of a Sprinkler. Nettle Vines will also only bloom on Deep Rainforest turf (in which they spawn) and on Dense Turf. If they are planted on any other turf, they will wither and never bloom, even if they get wetness.

## Tips
- The sparse placement of Nettle Vines combined

- Wormwood: Makes air water
- Wheeler: I'll be honest, I'm probably going to run through it.
- Choose: Woodie

The **Sprinkler** is a craftable **Structure** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It is found in the **Food Tab**, requires 2 **Alloy**, 1 **Blue Gem** and 6 pieces of **Ice** to craft, and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. Sprinklers have a radius that requires them to be close to nearby **Water**. When built, a pipe appears which connects them to the water.

**Nettle Vine**s that are planted near the Sprinkler will grow outside of **Humid Season**. Additionally, farms planted within the Sprinkler radius will grow crops faster.

Sprinklers must be fueled, and the amount of fuel is indicated by a red gauge on the front similar to the **Ice Flingomatic**. It can accept any type of **Fuel**. A full tank allows the Sprinkler to run for approximately 7.5 min or 15 day segments.

If a player stands within the radius, they will quickly become wet from the Sprinkler at a rate of ~3 **Wetness** per second. This can be prevented by wearing water-resistant or water-proofing items (e.g., **Rain Coat**, **Eyebrella**, **Umbrella**).

## Physics
An open Mast increases the maximum velocity of a Boat by 2.5, and an open Winged Sail increases the speed by 4. Each other successive mast is 30% less effective than the previous (Winged Sail effects apply first). The final maximum speed is bounded between 1 (without mast) and 10.

|-------------------|-------|
| None              | 0     |
| Dragonfly Wing Mast| 2.5   |
| 2x Dragonfly Wing Mast| 4.25   |
| Dragonfly Wing Mast + Standard Mast | 5.475    |
| Dragonfly Wing Mast + Winged Sail | 5.75    |

Note that the base speed is 0, which is raised to 1 by the bound.

# Beefalo Wool

- **Description**: Transmute Beard Hair into Beefalo Wool.
- **Image**: ![Beefalo Wool Dropped](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve/images/8/8b/Beefalo_Wool_Dropped.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/360/height/360?cb=20190803152308)
- **Burn Time**: 45 seconds.
- **Stack**: 40.
- **Dropped by**: Beefalo (3x), Baby Beefalo (1 as Baby, 2 as Toddler and Teen), Tumbleweed (1% 3x).
- **Spawn Code**: "beefalowool"
- **Filter**: ![Wilson Filter](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve/images/1/14/Wilson_Filter.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/32/height/32?cb=20160113004358)
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Ingredient 1**: Beard Hair
- **Multiplier 1**: 2 (Wilson only)
- **Skill**: Transmute Icky 2
- **Skill Owner**: Wilson

Beefalo Wool is an **Item** obtained by either killing a **Beefalo** or a **Baby Beefalo**, or by shaving a **sleeping** Beefalo with a **Razor**. It is used to make a **Saddle**, **Winter Hat**, **Beefalo Hat**, **Puffy Vest**, and **Carpeted Flooring**.

Beefalo Wool also makes an excellent **Fuel** source for **Campfires** and **Fire Pits**. A small herd of Beefalo can easily keep a Fire Pit lit for days, and as the wool grows back, this is a good short term solution.
There are alternative methods of obtaining Beefalo Wool; harvesting a **Tumbleweed**, or befriending a **Catcoon**, as friendly Catcoons may give Beefalo Wool as a gift.

Willow needs Beefalo Wool to craft **Bernie**. It is also required to craft **Lures** and to complete the construction of the **Royal Tapestry**.

Beefalo Wool can be crafted by Wilson if he got "Transmute Icky II"

# Suspicious Boulder

- Rocks ×1
- Flint ×1
- Moon Rock ×3.3

### Spawn Code
`rock_moon_shell`

### Renewal
No

### Biome
[Rockyland]

### Quotes
- Wilson: "That rock came from the moon."
- Willow: "Just another rock to me."
- Wolfgang: "But is not cheese?"
- Wendy: "It's traveled so far..."
- WX-78: "A ROCK. FROM THE MOON"

- Wurt: "Moonrock!"
- Wanda: "I never would have predicted I'd see a piece of the moon up close."

### Description
During a meteor shower, a special Smooth Meteor Boulder will have a chance of falling which is differentiated from regular Meteor Boulders by its round shape. Only one of this kind of boulder can be found, as it can be mined to produce the **Celestial Orb**. If a Smooth Meteor Boulder has not dropped by day 60 the next meteor shower has a 100% chance of dropping it. Mining all boulders within the meteor field increases the chance of the Suspicious Boulder spawning.

The probability of the Suspicious Boulder appearing will depend on the following factors:
- Level of friendship of players with the **Crabby Hermit**
- Number of fully constructed **Celestial Altars**.

It drops the Celestial Orb, 1 **Rocks**, 1 **Flint** and 3 **Moon Rock** plus a 30% chance to get one extra when mined.

# Tooth Trap

## Description
A Tooth Trap is a craftable [[Weapon]] that can be placed on the ground and deals 60 damage to any [[Mob]] that steps on it. It has 10 uses and must be reset after each use. Tooth Traps are found in the [[Fight Tab]], require a [[Log]], a [[Rope]] and a [[Hound's Tooth]] to craft, and an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype.

### Attributes
- **Icon:** Tooth Trap.png
- **Ingredients:**
  - Log: 1
  - Rope: 1
  - Hound's Tooth: 1
- **Tier:** 2
- **Durability:** 10 uses
- **Perk:** Deals 60 damage when triggered
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** "trap_teeth"

### Quotes
- **Wilson:** "This is a nasty surprise."
- **Willow:** "It would be better with fire."
- **Wolfgang:** "It bites bottoms from below!"

### Gallery
![Inactive](Tooth Trap Build.png)
![Active](Tooth Trap Active Build.png)
![Dropped](Tooth Trap Dropped.png)

### Additional Info
- Tooth Trap damage does not aggro nearby mobs, nor does it increase a player's [[Krampus#Naughtiness|Naughtiness]].
- Tooth Traps are fireproof in all versions of the game.
- A Tooth Trap can be picked up and placed elsewhere at any time, regardless of having been triggered or not.

## Mobs that Cannot Activate Tooth Traps
- [[Abigail]]
- [[Bee]]
- [[Killer Bee]]
- [[Butterfly]]
- [[Batilisk]]
- [[Mosquito]]
- [[Birds]]
- [[Chester]]
- [[Lureplant]]
- [[Dragonfly]]

- Mounted [[Beefalo]]
- [[Shadow Creature]]

## Skins
![Tiger Fang Trap](Tiger Fang Trap Icon.png) | **Woven - Elegant Tiger Fang Trap**: "No tigers were harmed in the making of this trap. But some humans were."

## Tips
- Tooth Traps are ineffective against Lureplants and their Eyeplants; Eyeplants will eat Tooth Traps. Placing man-made [[Turf]] will prevent Eyeplants from spawning.
- A useful way to kill [[Pig]]s, or other mobs, without increasing Naughtiness, is to place food near the Tooth Traps (ideally so the trap will kill the victim before it reaches the food).
- Surrounding small groups of about 4 [[Berry Bush]]es with [[Walls]] and Tooth Traps allow farming [[Gobbler]]s, which also protects unharvested [[Berries]] from them.

## Trivia
- The Tooth Trap used to cost 100 points under the old [[Research Points List|Research Points]] system.
- Tooth Traps were first added in the [[Don't Starve/Version History#December 19, 2012 – Long Live the Queen|Long Live The Queen!]] update.

## Description
Mant Hills are structures exclusive to the [[Don't Starve: Hamlet|'Hamlet']] DLC which are found in the [[Deep Rainforest]] [[Biomes|biome]]. By default, three Mant Hill entrances are generated on the starting island.

On the outside, a Mant Hill entrance resembles a large nest with a hole in the center where the player can enter. On the inside, the Mant Hill consists of a series of tunnels that go from room to room, similar to the [[Ancient Pig Ruins]]. Each Mant Hill is connected to the two others via the underground rooms, but none of them leads to another island.

The various rooms may contain [[Lamp]]s, [[Honey Chest]]s, [[Stalagmites]], or [[Antcomb Home]]s (where the [[Mant]]s spawn as larvae). All of these structures can be [[Hammer|hammered]] or [[Pickaxe|mined]], though they are not renewable. Mants will not become aggressive upon mining/hammering these structures. The [[Queen Womant]] Den entrance is also to be found in here.

When being inside Mant Hills, there is no loss of [[Sanity]] in darkness. Mant Hills spawn up to 4 [[Mant]]s. Each killed Mant take 120 seconds to regen and 30 seconds to release.

## Pathways
Each room has 4 walls. On each of these 4 walls there may, or may not be a Door, leading to another similar room. If two rooms are interconnected, the World Map will signal this by a two-way arrow (notice that the Map will only reveal rooms that have already been visited).

Periodically, [[earthquake]]-like rumbling will occur, causing many passageways in the Mant Hill to change place, including those in the room the player is standing in. After an earthquake, passageways signaling two previously interconnected rooms will display a "?" instead of the two-ways arrow, signaling that it may have changed. If that room is re-entered, the "?" will either change back into an arrow, or disappear. The exits, however, will never change position and the player will never be unable to reach one.

## Bugs
- Trying to spawn a Mant hill manually with the console command will crash the game. The bug reporting window will state: "THIS ROOM ALREADY EXISTS".
- Dying in a different world (any of the three DLC realms, as well as [[caves]], [[ruins]], and the [[volcano]]) and respawning from a [[Meat Effigy]] or [[Magic Flower]] that was placed inside any [[Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet]] DLC interior ([[Slanty Shanty]] etc.) will cause the player to be respawned out in the void of the world holding the respawn structure. It is recommended to use the command `c_warp("prefab")` to teleport the character back into the world, as walking back in can be problematic for world types such as [[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]].

## Description
Abandoned Junk are objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**.

The first three Abandoned Junk structures spawn in a **Junk Yard**, along with **Research Notes**, 4-7 days after **assisting Wagstaff**. If there is a **Scrappy Werepig** wandering around the **Junk Yard**, then Abandoned Junk will be placed in any other random place. Every 1-15 days after that, the **Grainy Transmission** (Wagstaff) appears next to a player, running toward where the machines spawned. This takes longer to occur each time and occurs 11 times in total. After all three Abandoned Junk are destroyed, a new set of them respawns 4-7 days afterwards, and a new set of Wagstaff appearances occurs.

Destroying an Abandoned Junk structure drops 1-2 **Scrap**, with a chance for 1 of any of **Cut Stone**, **Electrical Doodad**, **Frazzled Wires**, and very rarely **Second-hand Dentures**. It also has a 40% chance to drop one of the Rare **Blueprint**s for the **Auto-Mat-O-Chanic**, **W.A.R.B.I.S. Head Gear**, **W.A.R.B.I.S. Armor**, and **Elastispacer**.

## Trivia
- Abandoned Junk was introduced in the **Host of Horrors** update.
- The third version of this structure appears to have a gas cylinder made from Dragonfly's Scales.
- On initial beta release, prior to Update 575729, the drop chance for a Blueprint was 20%. There was also a lower chance to drop an additional Scrap.

## Scrapbook Info

Grows trees up one stage. Can also restore 8 Growth Formula, 32 Compost, and 8 Manure to Farm Soil. Used on Wormwood will heal 2 Health and 1 Health a second for 32 seconds.

## Tree Jam

Tree Jam is an item exclusive to Don't Starve Together and introduced in the Waterlogged beta.

It is crafted using two Figs and a Glommer's Goop. It can be used to enrich Knobbly Trees to eventually turn them into Above-Average Tree Trunks, and can also be used on any Tree to instantly grow it by one stage. It can also serve as Fertilizer, restoring 8 Growth Formula, 32 Compost, and 8 Manure to farm soil. Wormwood can fertilize himself with it to heal 2 + 32 (over 32 sec) health and trigger his blooming. Additionally, it can seal the leak on a Boat without leaving any patch, doing so will also repair 20 Hull for Boat.

### Tips

- Tree Jam is the only way to completely remove leaks on a boat, as Wavey Jones will attempt to remove Boat Patches and Trusty Tapes at 25% Sanity.
- Knobbly Trees not fully grown after sprouting from a Knobbly Seed will advance their growth as well, rather than be enriched. To avoid the potential waste of a Tree Jam, make sure that the Knobbly Tree is at its final stage before attempting to enrich it.

# Krissures

## Exclusivity: Shipwrecked
### Object Infobox
- **Image:** ![Krissure](File:Krissure.png)
- **Perk:** Produces **Light** and **Heat**.
- **Renew:** No
- **Spawn Code:** "flamegeyser"

### Quotes
- **Wolfgang:** "Watch Wolfgang walk over this!"
- **Wilson:** "Maybe I should stand back."
- **Willow:** "Glorious..."
- **Woodie:** "Woah, cool it!"
- **Maxwell:** "That puts on quite a spectacle."

- **Choose:** "Wilson"

Krissures are objects found in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. After a player has dug up a **Magma Pile**, a Krissure may appear and erupt. Krissures will alternate between dormant and erupting states. It can be used as a **Light** source, but it may burn if a player stands too close. Note that it's the initial burst of krissure that sets things on fire, not the lasting flame itself. The player can cook **Food** over an erupting Krissure. **Flooded** Krissures do not erupt. Krissures can be removed using **coconades** explosion.

**Sprinklers** in the **Hamlet** DLC can be used to stop a Krissure from erupting, but caution should be taken when removing said sprinkler.

## Bugs
- If the player dies near Krissures and uses a **Touchstone**, **Life Giving Amulet**, **Meat Effigy**, or another method of resurrection, the Krissure will sometimes get stuck in the erupting state, but no longer allow the player to cook **Food**. This may also occur at the end of the Werebeaver transformation while playing as **Woodie**.
- While probably not meant to be in the game, **Willow** does not get a **Sanity** bonus while standing next to an erupting Krissure. She still retains fire immunity.

## Winter's Feast Tree

- **Name:** Winter's Feast Tree
- **Spawn Code:** Cannot be spawned directly
- **Image:** Festive Tree.png
- **Can be Burned:** Yes (1)
- **Perk:** Give presents to players sleep near the tree.

### Exclusivity
- **Don't Starve Together**
- **Event:** Winter's Feast

### Quotes
- **Wilson:** Happy Winter's Feast!
- **Willow:** Looks great!
- **Wolfgang:** Tree looks very happy!
- **Wendy:** Oh, joy.
- **WX-78:** IT'S JUST A TREE... WE ARE SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THEM
- **Wickerbottom:** Lovely job on the tree, dears.
- **Woodie:** Must... not chop...
- **Maxwell:** How wretchedly jolly.
- **Wigfrid:** A majestic pine, worthy of celebration!

- **Wurt:** Never saw such pretty tree!
- **Walter:** I'm glad I've got you to spend the holiday with, Woby.
- **Wanda:** It's a fully grown pine tree.
- **Choose:** Wickerbottom

Winter's Feast Trees can be grown by planting a **Pine Cone**, a **Birchnut**, a **Twiggy Tree Cone**, or a **Palmcone Sprout** in a **Festive Tree Planter**. They take four stages to grow, and once fully grown, they will stop their life cycle.

When fully grown, players can decorate the Winter's Feast Tree with Winter Ornaments and certain Winter Foods. The trees have eight item slots, allowing for eight different ornaments to be placed on them, and they can also serve as light sources if decorated with Festive Lights.

Winter's Feast Trees can be chopped with an **Axe**, dropping the resources of its respective tree and equal size drops, as well as any Ornaments placed on them. The Festive Tree Planter will also be destroyed and drop its crafting materials.

If a player sleeps within 6.5 pitchfork tiles of a Winter's Feast Tree, a Gift will appear under the tree. To receive the Gift, the tree must be in complete darkness. After the player sleeps near a Winter's Feast Tree in complete darkness, a soft ringing of a bell will be heard shortly, and a gift can be found under the tree.

This feature has a cooldown of four days for a Gift of valuable items. The following table lists the items that can be obtained from the Gift:

| Days since last gift | Tree Decorations | Possible Gift Contents |
|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Less than 4         | Any             | One Charcoal and one of Gingerbread Cookie, Sugar Cookie, Candy Cane, Eternal Fruitcake, Chocolate Log Cake, Plum Pudding, Apple Cider, Hot Cocoa, Heavenly Eggnog |
| 4 or more           | Partially Decorated | Moon Rock (30%), Gears (15%), Beefalo Hat, Winter Hat, Rabbit Earmuffs, Cat Cap, Moggles (7.5%), Compass (4.5%), Sewing Kit, Red Gem, Blue Gem (3%), Green Gem, Orange Gem, Yellow Gem (1.5%) |
| 4 or more           | Fully Decorated   | Gears, Moon Rock, Tam o' Shanter, Walking Cane (14%), Red Gem, Blue Gem, Green Gem, Orange Gem, Yellow Gem, Pan Flute (7%) |

Like regular trees, Winter's Feast Trees provide protection from **Rain** and **Overheating** for players close to it.

> "OCCUPIED WX-78"

**Structures** are objects which can be built using resources found throughout the world. Most of them must be prototyped using a **Science Machine** or **Alchemy Engine** the first time they are built. This will consume the necessary resources even if the structure placement is cancelled (RMB), however placing can be done at any later time without additional costs by re-selecting the structure in **Game Tabs|Crafting Tabs**. Structures can be destroyed with a **Hammer** or a **Deconstruction Staff** to receive at least 50% or 100% of the resources used to build them respectively (except **Walls**, **Wooden Flooring**, and **Sign**s which give 1 **item** only).

Some structures can be naturally spawned in the world, such as **Pig House**s and **Stone Wall**s surrounding the **Box Thing**. In fact, many unique **Set Pieces** made from multiple structures can be randomly generated at world creation.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, the player can craft **Scaled Chest**s and while playing as **Webber**, **Spider Eggs** in the Structures Tab.

In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, **Sea Chest**s, **Limestone Walls**, **Sea Walls**, **Ballphin Palace**s, **Wildbore House**s, **Prime Ape Hut**s, **Dragoon Den**s, **Snakeskin Rug**s, **Sandbag**s, and **Sand Castle**s were added to this tab.

The **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC introduces **Cork Barrel**s, **Beard Hair Rug**, **Lawn Turf**, **Cultivated Turf** and **Dense Turf** to the Structures Tab.

The Tidy Hidey-Hole is a naturally spawning object exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. It can be found in the Ancient Archive biome. The Tidy Hidey-Hole spawns only one Dust Moth at a time. If the dust moth is killed, it respawns 10 days later.

When the Dust Moth is fed an Amberosia, it will ornate its Tidy Hidey-Hole with Thulecite. This process takes 6 minutes. Once decorated, the Tidy Hidey-Hole can be mined for 3 Thulecite Fragments plus a 75% chance to get one extra, plus a 50% chance to get one extra, plus two 25% chances to get one extra along with a 1% chance to drop one complete Thulecite. One harvest yields on average the equivalent of 4.81 Thulecite Fragments.

## Trivia
- The Tidy Hidey-Hole was introduced in the Return of Them#Forgotten Knowledge update.

# Chilled Amulet

## Overview
The Chilled Amulet is a craftable item found in the **Magic Tab**. It requires a Prestihatitator to prototype and costs 3 Gold Nuggets and 1 Blue Gem to craft. It can also randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when the latter is damaged. It can be equipped in the chest slot and lasts for 6 minutes (3/4th of an in-game day). While a player has the Chilled Amulet equipped, they will gain +2 sanity per minute.

## Details

- **Equip Slot:** Body
- **Image:** ![Chilled Amulet](Chilled Amulet Dropped.png)
- **Icon:** ![Chilled Amulet](Chilled Amulet.png)
- **Scrapbook Description:** Raises sanity while cooling the wearer.
- **Tab:** Magic
- **Tier:** 4
- **Ingredients:**
  - **1. Gold Nugget (x3)**
  - **3. Blue Gem (x1)**
- **Dropped By:** Ancient Pseudoscience Station (Slotmachine, Shipwrecked icon)
- **Sold By:** The Flying Pig Arcane Shop (30 Oinc × Hamlet icon)
- **Durability:** 33 attacks
- **Discharge Rate:** 6 min.
- **Perk:** Lowers body temperature, Restores Sanity, Freezes attackers when hit.
- **Sanity Drain:** +2/min
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** "blueamulet"
- **Description:** What a cool amulet.

## Downloadable Content

- In the Reign of Giants and the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLCs, wearing a Chilled Amulet will protect players from Overheating.
- In the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, Chilled Amulets can be bought for 30 Oincs at The Flying Pig Arcane Shop in the Pig City.

## Tips

- The amulet only lasts for 6 minutes, so using it solely to regain only 12 total sanity is inadvisable.
- The Chilled Amulet requires more hits from mobs to freeze them than the Ice Staff needs.
- The Chilled Amulet provides no protection against any Fire damage.
- In the Reign of Giants DLC, since the amulet can only be worn for 6 minutes, its best use is early in the game during the middle of Summers.

## Trivia

- The Chilled Amulet shares the same in-game model with the Lazy Forager but its gem is blue instead of orange.
