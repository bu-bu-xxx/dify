**Leafy Meatloaf** is a **Crock Pot** recipe exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** introduced in **Return of Them**. It's made of 2 **Leafy Meat** and any fillers. It was added in the **Troubled Waters** update, alongside other Leafy Meat and Barnacle-based dishes.

As **Leafy Meat** is a **meat** item, the dish also counts as a meat item. As such **Wigfrid** can eat it while **Wurt** cannot. Leafy Meat is regularly produced by **Lureplants** but is also dropped by **Grass Gekkos**, **Carrots**, **Saladmanders**, and **Grass Gators**.

In general, this recipe is designed to punish uncreative usage of Leafy Meat, and to prevent easy access to 2.0 meat value without other kinds of Meat. The recipe has a higher priority than **Monster Lasagna**, thus it is possible to put 2 **Monster Meats** or **Durians** in the **Crock Pot**. The recipe accepts twigs and other **inedibles** as fillers and due to its priority, it'll always overtake **Kabobs**.

## Hunting
Cormorants can be encountered in the Shallow Ocean. They drop Roe instead of Seeds and eat Roe left on Ocean. They fly down from off-screen and peck the ground for a few moments, then fly away. When they take flight, there is a chance that Seeds are left behind. Birds will also be attracted to Seeds left on the ground. If the player or most other mobs get too close, birds will be frightened away. Birds won't land on Sticky Webbing and will swiftly fly away if they already lands.

When killed, birds drop a Morsel or a Feather, and all other birds nearby will fly away. They are considered innocent creatures and killing them directly adds points to the player's naughtiness level, which causes Krampus to appear. Killing a Crow adds 1 point to the player's naughtiness level while killing a Redbird or Snowbird adds 2 points to the player's naughtiness level.

Birds inside the player's inventory will starve in 2 days unless they are fed Seeds.

In Shipwrecked, Birds take 100 poison damage per interval instead of normal 2. Birds won't land on flooding tiles, and will swiftly fly away if they already lands and the flooding spreads.

### Hunting Techniques
- Birds can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one.
- They can be Murdered by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel.
- Birds in the player's inventory can be dropped on the ground and will flop on the ground belly-up for a short while before flying off.
- They can also be imprisoned in Bird Cages.

### Ranged Weapons
- Hunting Birds requires a ranged weapon such as a Boomerang. Birds will not land within melee range (even if bait is placed on the ground) and will fly away when the player approaches. However, if they are put to sleep when using characters with a normal damage modifier, they can be killed in 1 hit with a sufficient melee weapon.

### Sleeping Items
- If a bird is in flight while in range of a sleeping item's effect, it will plummet to the ground and can be picked up as an item.

### Feather Hat
- Wearing a Feather Hat will increase the number of Birds spawning as well as decreasing the time between spawns. Using Birds of the World (while playing as Wickerbottom) will also cause a large number of them to land.

### Sleeping Darts
- They take one blast from the Ice Staff to be frozen and one Sleep Dart to be put to sleep.

## Usage
### Recipes
- **Hand Tool**
  - **Item:** Cormorant

# Glass Sculptures

Don't Starve Together exclusive **Glass Sculptures** are carryable **Structures** that were introduced in the **A New Reign** update. To acquire Glass Sculptures, players must defeat the **Antlion** during **Summer**. These sculptures can be easily broken with a **Hammer** and will also break if an Antlion spawns a new Sand Castle or Sand Spike underneath the sculpture. Like **Suspicious Marble** and **Chess Pieces**, they cannot be placed in the **Inventory** and instead go directly into the chest slot when picked up, causing the player to move very slowly.

## Glass Spike

| Name       | Equip Slot | Icon                | Image                            | Perk                     | Stack | Spawn Code                  |

**Glass Spikes** come in three different sizes and are obtained by melting the Antlion's **Sand Spikes** using a **Torch**, a **Fire Staff**, or a **Lighter**.

## Glass Castle

| Name       | Equip Slot | Icon                | Image                            | Perk                     | Stack | Spawn Code                  |

The **Misshapen Bird** is a hostile mob exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, and introduced in the **Return of Them#Eye of the Storm** beta.

Misshapen Birds will attack any player that gets close by lobbing a projectile in an arc. This projectile deals damage in a small area around where it lands. This can lead to a Misshapen Bird damaging itself and dying as a result.

They will land in flocks alongside **Moonblind Crows** inside of **Moonstorms** while **Grainy Transmission|Wagstaff** is containing the storm. They will slowly move toward the **Restrained Static** container and attempt to attack it if within range. Regardless of if the containment succeeds or not, all Misshapen Birds that spawned will remain and wander the area until they are killed.

Misshapen Birds can be caught using a **Trap** or **Bird Trap**. They can then be placed into a **Birdcage** or murdered for one **Rot**.

If placed in a Birdcage, the Misshapen Bird will drop Rot instead of **Crop Seeds** from being fed a raw **Fruit** or **Vegetable**, and will drop a **Rotten Egg** instead of an **Egg** if fed **Meats**. A Misshapen Bird inside a Birdcage does not sleep at night during a **Moon Cycle|Full Moon**.

**Exclusivity:** Shipwrecked  
**Perk:** Companion  
**Stack:** Does not stack  
**Spawn Code:** "rawling"  
**Sanity Drain:** +3.33/min

## Quotes
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang plays ball!"
- Wilson: "It's my buddy!"
- Willow: "He keeps me company."
- Woodie: "What a nutter!"
- Maxwell: "Oh good. A talking sack of stuffing."

- Wormwood: "New fun friend!"
- Wheeler: "You look like you've seen your share of adventure."
- Choose: Wagstaff

### Rawling
Rawling is an **Item** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is a sentient basketball that while carried, will comment on player actions. It speaks in red text, much like **Lucy the Axe**. When speaking a squeaking noise can be heard. It will also restore 2 **sanity**/min while equipped in the hand slot. It can also be thrown, and throwing it restores 1 **sanity**.

**Rawling can be found randomly in the deep Ocean, floating in the water. Despite Rawling being a special item, Prime Ape**s can still pick them up.

## Quotes
### Idling
- "Let's cut the bottom out of the basket."

### Put in container
- "This isn't a peach basket..."

### Equipped
- "Is this some kind of Canadian joke?"
- "You can carry me. For a couple of steps."
- "Feel 'free' to throw me."

### When dropped
- "Dribble me!"

### On ground
- "I could use a little pick me up."

### Picked up
- "Is that you James?"
- "You're MY MVP!"

### When thrown
- "Shoot!"
- "I believe I can fly!"
- "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take!"
- "To the peach basket!"

### On fire
- "I'm on fire!"
- "Ow ow ow ow ow!"

### Extinguished
- "Saved!"

### Being bounced
- "Ouch!"
- "Nothin' but peaches!"
- "Splish!"
- "Rejected!"

### Hitting water
- "Swish!"

## Tips
- When thrown at a tall structure (i.e. **tent**), Rawling will bounce down back to the player, allowing for fast sanity regeneration by repeatedly throwing and catching Rawling. This can be used as an alternative method to restore sanity, in absence of other sanity restoring items.
- When a wet Rawling is equipped, the sanity will be drained instead of being restored. This is because having a wet item equipped drains sanity faster than Rawling restores it, making the net effect negative.
- While Rawling has infinite durability, it can catch fire so care should be taken about where it is thrown or stored as **Fire Packim Baggims** will reduce it to ash.
- When playing as **Wendy**, an equipped Rawling will completely negate the sanity drain from the Night.
- In **Hamlet**-compatible worlds, one can quickly restore sanity by repeatedly throwing and picking Rawling in a corner of **interior**.

## Trivia
- Rawling was supposed to be an Item exclusive to **Watricia**, a **Character** that was supposed to be released with **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**, but was later scrapped in favor of **Wilbur**.
- Rawling is likely a reference to Wilson, the volleyball companion of Chuck Noland from the movie **Cast Away**.
  - In the movie, the volleyball is given this name due to the fact that it was made by **Wilson Sporting Goods**; meaning that Rawling's name likely comes from **Rawlings**, a similar sporting good company.
- While the item itself is a reference to **Cast Away**, the lines spoken by

- Wormwood: Bad stuff! Bad!

- Wurt: Mouth box! Glorp!
- WX78: CERTAINLY DISGUSTING

## Description

The Ornery Chest is a neutral Mob that mimics an Ornate Chest. It looks like a normal Ornate Chest and has the same loot table. The Ornery Chest can be revealed when players open the mimicked Ornate Chest. Once revealed, it will start to attack the players and knock out the items in their inventory. It will also eat the items on the ground. If a Shadow Atrium is devoured, it will drop a Possessed Shadow Atrium when killed. Every Ornery Chest can only infuse 1 Shadow Atrium into Possessed Shadow Atrium.

Ornery Chest has Planar Entity Protection, which greatly reduces Physical Damage from a Weapon.

Ornery Chests will not spawn until the players enable Shadow Rift. After killing Ancient Fuelweaver, players can give 5 Dreadstones to Beckoning Hand to enable Shadow Rift. After 5 days, the first Rift will open, and roughly 1/3 of the Ornate Chests will turn into Ornery Chests. After that, every time the Shadow Rift spawns, it will turns more Ornate Chests into Ornery Chests.

## Tips

- It is possible that Ornate Chests will all get turned into Ornery Chests after a few Rifts.
- Resetting the ruins will also reset the Ornery Chests.
- The player can let Ornery Chest eat a Trap as well as a Shadow Atrium. When it is Killed, the Trap will drop on the ground and catch the Possessed Shadow Atrium.
  - If the player is quick enough, they can pick up the Possessed Shadow Atrium by hand before it starts to move.

## Trivia

- From Rhymes with Play stream, the original plan was for the Ornery Chest to mimic your chests in the base. But due to the fact that the mob would be encountered very rarely, and also due to the fact that it would be necessary to draw a new skin for it for each chest, it was decided to abandon this idea.

# Slurtle Mound

![Slurtle Mound](Image:Slurtle Mound.png)

A **Slurtle Mound** is a large, slimy rock pillar found in **Caves** which spawns **Slurtle**s (90%) and **Snurtle**s (10%) when hit or after an **Earthquake**. Slurtles/Snurtles emerge from the mound after earthquakes to eat the fallen **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Nitre**, **Gold**, and **Gems**. Snurtles rarely spawn from the Mound and flee immediately instead of attacking the player. Snurtles, when given the opportunity, will eat Earthquake items in the same fashion as the Slurtle.

## Attributes

- **Can Be Burned:** Yes
- **Resources:** Slurtle Slime (x3), Broken Shell (DST)
- **Renew:** No
- **Spawn Code:** "slurtlehole"
- **Spawns:** Slurtle (90%), Snurtle (10%)
- **Health:** 350

## Quotes

- **Wilson:** "A den of 'ew'."
- **Wendy:** "The slurtles pop out when they outgrow it."
- **Willow:** "I should burn them out."
- **Wolfgang:** "Hole full of slugs."

## Strategy

- Slurtles, when attacked, will either strike back or hide in their shells. Their Mounds can be destroyed by using a group of **Bunnymen** or **Rock Lobsters**, or even kite them away and attack.
- One can make an explosive farm with Slurtle Mounds. Both Slurtles and Snurtles are flammable and explosive, and they'll follow the player if they have any minerals. Guiding them to any dangerous monster and making them explode with the **Fire Staff** can take out the larger monsters.

## Description
Birchnut Trees are Plants found in the Reign of Giants DLC. They are found mainly in Grasslands and frequently in Deciduous Forests. When chopped, they will yield 1-3 Logs and up to 2 Birchnuts, depending on the season. If cut in its prime (the largest form) it will yield 2 Birchnuts in Autumn (colored leaves), 1 in Spring and Summer (green leaves), and no Birchnuts in Winter (leafless). Standing under one offers moderate wetness protection from Rain, and slows Overheating.

## Seasonal Chances
| Season       | 4-20   | 21-35  | 36-70  | 71+    |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Autumn       | 3%     | 7.5%   | 15%    | 16.8% |
| Winter       | 0%     | 0%     | 0%     | 0%    |
| Spring       | 1.6%   | 4%     | 8%     | 8.96% |
| Summer       | 0.66%  | 1.65%  | 3.3%   | 3.696%|

## Tips
- It is best to chop down Birchnut Trees in Autumn, since they drop an extra Birchnut, which means the player can more efficiently make a Birchnut Tree farm, or plant one Birchnut and use the other for a Trail Mix.
- Birchnutters can be an effective way to gather Birchnuts and Twigs.

## Trivia
- The name "Birchnut" is a portmanteau of the words "birch" and "chestnut". Birchnuts also look similar to chestnuts, and the bark of the Birchnut tree looks similar to that of the birch tree.
- It may also be a pun on "beechnuts", the fruit and seeds of the beech tree. Wickerbottom says the species belongs in Fagales, which is the taxonomic order that includes beeches, chestnuts, and birches.
- In the first version of Reign of Giants, Birchnut Trees were simply named "Deciduous Trees". It's still named as such in the game's files.
- Pigs, and other mobs that are able to smash structures, are the only mobs that can destroy Poison Birchnut Trees.
- Despite having white bark,

The Peagawk is a Mob exclusive to the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. It is typically encountered in the Wild Plains and Rainforest Biomes with its tail feathers arranged in a way to resemble a bush with many blinking eyes. It eats Vegetables off the ground.

Moving closer to it will cause it to run away from the player, but it can be lured with Petals or Vegetables for an easy kill. Upon death, it drops two Drumsticks and one Peagawk Plume. Peagawk also run away from Poison Dartfrogs.

Peagawk Plumes can also be obtained by picking them directly on the alive bird. In order to do this, the Peagawk has to be distracted, asleep, or cornered, or else it will run away. It takes one sleep dart to put a Peagawk to sleep.

Peagawk Plumes can be traded for two Oincs each, once per day. With four Peagawk plumes, one Cloth, and one Pig Skin, one can craft a Gas Mask, to protect from Hay Fever and poison damage in the Gas Rainforest.

A single Peagawk can provide up to seven plumes the first time one picks it. A bald Peagawk will regrow one plume per day. Peagawks are not currently known to respawn.

### Trivia

* It appears to use the same base model as the Gobbler.
* The name "Peagawk" is a portmanteau of "peacock" and "gawk".
* Before the update of 11.20, only the plume of the top could be picked, but regrew every 10 seconds, making the Plume farm infinite.
* Peagawks always drop one of their feathers when killed, regardless of how many have been picked.
* WX-78 is able to outrun and pluck Peagawks while overcharged.
* There is an Unimplemented mob, the peahen, that was likely intended to be related to peagawks. Peahens behave like buzzards, however.

### Bugs

* The texture of the bald hiding Peagawk is missing. Therefore, when calming down, it will appear to have all its feathers, while in reality, it doesn't have them anymore.

- **Winona (Telebrella)**: "I should give it a scan with the ol' Calibrated Perceiver."

## Description
The Unstable Transmission is an item that can be acquired exclusively by Winona with the Founder's Keepers II skill. When equipped with Inspectacles, Winona can find Unstable Transmissions from Advanced Cacheboxes. These transmissions can only be stored in Winona's inventory and cannot be placed inside any storage container. They will disappear after a few seconds if left on the ground.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of Unstable Transmissions is to be scanned by the Calibrated Perceiver to unlock two exclusive Winona items. If the Unstable Transmission resembles a station, the player will receive the Teletransport Station crafting recipe. If it resembles an umbrella, the player will receive the Portasol crafting recipe.

Once both items are unlocked, Winona will no longer acquire Unstable Transmissions from Advanced Cacheboxes.

- You can travel via Worm Holes while carrying Suspicious Marble.
- Wolfgang can carry Suspicious Marble without speed reduction when he is mighty.
- Similar to the Worm Hole method, Wanda's Rift Watch can be used to quickly transport Suspicious Marble.

# Spilagmite

![Spilagmite](Spilagmite.png)

A **Spilagmite** is a unique type of [[Spider Den]] found exclusively in [[Caves]]. It is known for spawning [[Spider/Cave Spider|Cave Spiders]] and [[Spider/Spitter|Spitters]]. Spiders spawn from a Spilagmite at a rate of approximately 1 every 4 minutes, unless environmental factors alter this rate (e.g., something disturbing the webbing or an earthquake).

## Characteristics

- **Resources:**
  - [[Rocks]] ×2
  - [[Silk]] ×1.5
  - [[Spider Gland]] ×0.25
  - [[Fossils]] ×1.5

- **Renewal:** No

- **Tool:** Can be [[Tools#Mining_Tools|Mined]] with a [[Pickaxe]]

- **Spawns:**
  - [[Cave Spider]]
  - [[Spitter]]

## Spawning Mechanism

- A Spilagmite may contain up to 2 or 3 Spiders, with the maximum varying between Spilagmites.
- If the number of Spiders drops below the maximum, an additional Spider will spawn **inside** the Spilagmite in approximately 2 minutes.
- If an [[Earthquake]] occurs, all spiders outside will return to their home, provided that home remains existing.

## Spider Types

- Spiders spawned from a Spilagmite have a 33% chance of being a Spitter; the rest will be Cave Spiders.
- Unlike Spider Dens on the surface, the type of Spider spawned is always based on this probability and does not change due to circumstances (e.g., attacking the Spilagmite).

## Destruction and Resources

- A Spilagmite can be destroyed by mining it with any [[Pickaxe]] or a [[Pick/Axe]], causing it to disappear and drop 1 [[Silk]] and 2 [[Rocks]], possibly with an additional Silk and [[Spider Gland]].
- After two strikes, the Spilagmite loses its ability to spawn Spiders.
- Striking an active Spilagmite will spawn all remaining spiders still contained within.

## Sticky Webbing

Like surface Spider Dens, Spilagmites produce [[Spider Den#Sticky Webbing|Sticky Webbing]], which alerts the Cave Spiders and Spitters inside if a creature touches it. When the webbing is stepped on, two spiders will emerge simultaneously, provided at least two are inside the Spilagmite at the time. If any Spider is attacked within range of the Spilagmite, or the Spilagmite itself is attacked, all remaining Spiders in the Spilagmite will emerge to engage the threat.

If the spiders that emerged are not killed and lose interest in their foe, they will stay outside their Spilagmite and roam the area.

## Bugs

- Allowing a [[Clockwork Rook]] to collide with a Spilagmite sometimes crashes the game.
- The player can attempt to heal a Spilagmite with any healing item; however, a mined one will not return to its original state, despite how many healing items the player gives it.

## Description
Bones are naturally spawning objects that can be found around **Hound Mounds** or certain **Set Pieces** such as the Disused Beefalo Pen Trap. 

Players are to be wary around Bones, as they may indicate the presence of **Hound Mounds** nearby, which will spawn numerous aggressive **Hounds** that will attack the player or the Bones may be part of traps.

Bones can be found randomly scattered in the **Desert** **Biome**. They can also be **hammered** for **Bone Shards**. Type 3 bone piece (skull) has a 50% chance to also drop a **Hound's Tooth**.

Bones can also be found in **Caves**, typically in the Blue **Mushtree Forest** and on **Stalagmite Terrain**. Similar to the surface world variety, they also signal danger in the Caves, as they are often surrounded with nests of **Dangling Depth Dwellers**.

## Description
The Cave Banana Tree is a fruit-bearing plant which grows exclusively in the Ruins and Caves, commonly in the Village Biome and occasionally in a Sunken Forest. It provides a Cave Banana when picked and regrows the fruit in four days.

Cave Banana Trees can be chopped down with an Axe to yield two Twigs and one Log. Chopping leaves a stump, which can be dug with a Shovel for an additional Log. Setting the tree on fire, then chopping it once burned will produce one Charcoal, whether or not the Cave Banana was still on the tree when burned. Chopped or burned Cave Banana Trees do not respawn, making them a nonrenewable resource.

Splumonkeys will pick the fruit on Cave Banana Trees on sight. This will not affect the regrowth rate of four days.

## Trivia
The Cave Banana Tree is one of the few objects in the game with examination quotes for Wilbur.

## Description
The **Celestial Orb** is a portable Crafting station exclusive to *Don't Starve Together*. It is obtained by mining a Suspicious Boulder. If dropped on the ground, the Celestial Orb can be used to access the Level 1 Celestial Filter, which unlocks the crafting recipe for the Moon Rock Idol and Portal Paraphernalia. Similar to Chester's Eye Bone, it will automatically drop from the Inventory of players when leaving the game or entering the Caves. Celestial Orb will sink in the water, however, it will return to the coast afterwards.

After defeating the Celestial Champion, the Celestial Orb's crafting tab will gain access to all crafts of the Celestial Altar, Tribute, and Sanctum.

## Tips
- The Celestial Orb has a global Map icon, similar to Moonlenses. However, it is also visible if put in a container or held in a player's Inventory.
  - The Celestial Orb can be put inside a Chester to mark its location on map.
- The Celestial Orb is required to spawn the Celestial Champion.

## Trivia
- It gives off a small amount of light at night, but is not an appropriate light source to ward off Charlie.
  - The light radius becomes large enough to ward off Charlie after collecting it from defeating the Celestial Champion.

## Behavior

Grazers are hostile Mobs exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in From Beyond. They appear next to Lunar Rifts in groups of 1 to 6. Grazers spawn near a Lunar Rift upon its creation, and more spawn periodically as it grows larger. Upon spawning, Grazers take the form of a scattered group of sharp rocks on the ground. When a player gets close to them, these rocks group together and are enveloped in a white aura to fully form the Grazer. If the player moves too far from the Rift that the Grazer spawned from, the Grazer returns to the Rift and falls apart back to its original state. Grazers despawn with their home Rift once it disappears.

Grazers are hostile to players, and after fully forming they begin to slowly trudge towards their target. They are passive to other creatures, only fighting back against those that attack them. They have a unique aura which causes nearby players and most mobs (except for bosses and other lunar creatures) to become groggy, and eventually fall asleep after too much time spent near the Grazer. Once a player's character falls asleep, the Grazer bites them for 50 physical damage plus 10 planar damage, and causes a small knockback. Grazers only attack characters that have been put to sleep; while a character is conscious, Grazers opt to circle them until they fall unconscious.

Grazers have 2,400 Health. However, they cannot be killed. If their Health drops below 2,200, they fall apart and return to their original state. In this state, they cannot be damaged and regenerate Health at a rate of 80 HP/s. Once the Grazer reaches full Health, it reforms and resumes its attempt at putting its target to sleep. Grazers take 99,999% more damage from explosive weapons (Gunpowder, Slurtle Slime, Brightshade Bomb), which brings their Health to 1 instantly. Since they regenerate 80 Health per second, it takes 30 seconds for a Grazer to fully recover after being damaged by an explosive.

Grazers have Planar Entity Protection, and thus physical damage from weapons are less effective against them. For example, a Dark Sword would deal 41 damage instead of 68, and a Brightshade Sword would deal 32.99 physical damage and 30 planar damage to a Grazer instead of 38 and 30 respectively.

## Tips

- Eating a cooked Moon Shroom will instantly remove all grogginess from the player.
- Eating a Mushy Cake will drastically increase the player's sleep resistance, making it much harder, albeit not impossible, for the player to fall asleep.
- Wickerbottom cannot be put to sleep

## Quotes

- Wendy: A tree that knows only pain.
- WX-78: A SPIKY TREE
- Wickerbottom: A mangal rhizophora.

- Wurt: Shouldn't play too close to those, florp.
- Walter: Not a good tree for climbing.
- Wanda: What a gnarled old tree.
- Choose: Webber

## Description
Spiky Trees are found only in Marsh and Desert biomes. Instead of dropping Logs when chopped like other trees, Spiky Trees drop Twigs with only a 20% chance to drop a Log. Also, these trees do not have a life-cycle (changing size over time). There is also no way to replant them. Like other trees, the stumps of the Spiky variety can be dug up with a Shovel or Regal Shovel to get an additional log.

## Bugs
- When chopping down a burning tree (not one that has already burnt) with an Axe of any kind or as a Werebeaver, the game will sometimes crash, but when it doesn't, the tree will drop as many Logs and Pine Cones as listed above using only 1% of the Axe, as if it was a burnt tree. This bug was fixed in the RoG DLC.
- When dying near a tree, items will sometimes land on top of it in an unreachable location.
- When rapidly chopping down a tree with left click, sometimes the player's Axe will say 0% and take up one inventory space. This can also happen when fighting a mob such as a spider.

- Choose: Wilson

The **Totally Normal Tree** is a Tree found in the Forest Biome. It can be chopped down, giving the player 2 Living Logs. The player can then use a Shovel to dig up the stump to gain an additional Living Log. If burned, it will drop Charcoal when chopped just like other Trees.

These trees will have a randomized number of Evil Flowers growing near them. When cutting it down, it will make a groaning/moaning noise with every chop.

In Don't Starve Together, Totally Normal Trees have a 25% chance to drop a Clean Sweeper when cut down.

## Hallowed Nights

During the Hallowed Nights event, the Arboretum Experiment can be conducted to plant a Totally Normal Tree.

## Tips

- When chopped down and dug up, a single Totally Normal Tree will provide enough Living Logs to craft a Shadow Manipulator, without having to summon a Treeguard.

## Bugs

- Burning a Totally Normal Tree's stump will turn it into a Burnt Totally Normal Tree instead of dropping an Ash. These burnt Trees cannot be chopped down; one must use a Shovel to dig it up and receive 1 Charcoal.

## Description
The **Pangolden** is a large passive Mob exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. They are found in the **Painted** Biome and roll up when they face any danger. While rolled up, Pangoldens gain 75% Damage Reduction.

Pangoldens produce Gold nuggets and poop them out. To do that, they must eat either three Gold Dust, eat enough food on the ground, or slurp from a Sparkling Pool eight times.

Occasionally, a Pangolden will sit and lick its legs.

## Trivia
- The Pangolden's name is a portmanteau of the words "pangolin", the animal the mob is based off of, and the act of gold panning, which refers to the Mob's ability to gather gold dust from water.
- The Pangolden is not incapable of attack. It's just that in most cases, by the time they leave the defensive state, the rage is over, so players rarely see Pangolden attacks. If the player attacks it with a weapon that consistently deals damage, (like Weather Pain or Poison Spear) the player will be attacked by the Pangolden.

Mayor Truffleston is a [Pig Traders](Pig%20Traders) [Mob] exclusive to the '[Don't Starve: Hamlet](Don't%20Starve:%20Hamlet)' DLC. He is the Mayor of [Pig City](Pig%20City) Swinesbury, and thus he can be found in the [Swinesbury City Hall](Swinesbury%20City%20Hall). Only one spawns per village.

The player can give him a [Gold Nuggets](Gold%20Nuggets) and receive 5 [Oinc]s in exchange or buy a [Security Contract](Security%20Contract) (10 Oincs) or a [Deed of home ownership](Deed%20of%20home%20ownership) (50 Oincs) from him. There is no limit to the amount of Gold Nugget trades done in a day, however, as Gold Nuggets are especially rare and hard to obtain in the 'Hamlet' DLC and cost 10 Oincs to obtain from [Swinesbury Mineral Exchange](Swinesbury%20Mineral%20Exchange), selling them to the Mayor is not recommended, buying them instead from the Mineral exchange is the better option.

After obtaining the [Key to the City](Key%20to%20the%20City) from the [Pig Queen](Pig%20Queen) in the [Palace](Palace), the player can build their own City Hall and become Mayor themselves. This position grants them the right to collect [Oinc]s from the villagers who own houses built by the player every 10 days.

While as a mob he is known as Mayor Truffleston, he still spawns with randomly generated names like with all other Pig Traders.
