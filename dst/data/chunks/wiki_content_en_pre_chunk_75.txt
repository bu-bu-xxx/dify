# The Screecher
'The Screecher' is a total-conversion horror mod for 'Don't Starve', made by Klei Entertainment, and pre-installed on PC versions of 'Don't Starve'. It is a horror game similar to 'Slender', played through the eyes of protagonist William "Bill" Moran as he attempts to escape a campground while being stalked by a monster.

## Gameplay
![The Screecher as it appears in-game](File:Skreecher.PNG)  
'The Screecher' is played from a third-person perspective, the camera hovering just behind Bill's head. Consequently, Bill's face is never seen, but images can be found of his face in the game files.

Bill can get supplies by searching through various containers at campsites around Pillet Creek. These containers include things like Coolers, Duffle Bags, Jackets, Garbage Piles, etc. Most of the time, containers have nothing of interest, often times Bill exclaims that there is something rotting inside the container or that the contents were ripped to shreds. However, searching containers is crucial to survival in Pillet Creek.

Bill's most useful tool is the flashlight, which is always in a container at the starting point. Batteries are required to keep the flashlight on, and are also found in containers across Pillet Creek. The flashlight is crucial, because it's the only portable light source available and if Bill is left standing in complete darkness for more than a few seconds, he will die (a noise will be heard, similar to Charlie, when this happens).

Bill can also find a map of Pillet Creek, in a random container. This is another important item, allowing him to better navigate the campground. He will also find multiple notes. There are nine notes in total, and these act mostly as something extra to do, as they do not all need to be collected to finish 'The Screecher'.

Bill can interact with objects in Pillet Creek, similar to the way he searches containers. He can examine signs, light campfires, talk through a HAM radio, and restart a generator. All these actions use 'Don't Starve' type prompts.

After a certain point in the story, the Screecher will begin stalking Bill and will randomly appear in front of him as he walks along the trail (The Screecher stands still when viewed). If the player finds themselves looking at the Screecher, they must immediately look away or turn off their light, then wait a few seconds for the Screecher to disappear. If Bill looks at it for too long, it will screech, drain the flashlight's battery, and swiftly charge at Bill, killing him instantly.

## Plot
Bill Moran and Sarah Beacon are a couple arriving by helicopter for a week-long camping trip in the heavily forested campground of Pillet Creek on January 9, 1986. Shortly after they arrive, a Brazilian couple disappears, and something starts rummaging through their camp at night. Bill goes out on the night of the 14th in search of the Brazilians, and Sarah panics, leaves Bill a note and a flashlight at their campsite, and heads for the helipad. When Bill returns, it is pitch black. After hearing a strange screeching sound in the woods, he lights a Fire Pit, collects Sarah's flashlight, and sets off into the woods to investigate.

As Bill makes his way through Pillet Creek, his flashlight begins to flicker at odd times, and screeches can be heard in the distance. Realizing something is wrong, Bill decides to go to the helipad. On his way, he notices many other abandoned campsites, and finds some batteries for his flashlight, a map of Pillet Creek, and multiple notes, including diary entries, letters, scraps of paper with eerie warnings, a manifest for the helicopter, and the Pillet Creek emergency radio frequency.

He then finds a woman, cowering along the trail. As he approaches her, she runs into the woods in fear of the light. Later, at another campsite, Bill finds a disturbed man, wearing a hood and whimpering in a rocking chair with his back turned to Bill. As he approaches, the man's head turns sharply to face Bill, revealing (as an in-game Wikipedia:Internet screamer) that his entire face has been torn off (leaving nothing but bloody muscle tissue) just before he dies.

Eventually, Bill comes to a campsite with a massive bloodstain on the ground. After finding a note saying "IT HUNTS THOSE WHO STARE" written in blood, the campfire (if lit) will go out and his flashlight flickers out, leaving him in total

# Craftable Items Guide for Adventure Mode in Don't Starve

This guide covers different uses of craftable items that have been neglected by players due to different reasons such as inconvenience or just plainly thought as useless. This guide only includes vanilla **Don't Starve** (without DLC or DST).

## Tools Tab

- **[Regal Shovel](#)**: Unlike the other golden tools, shovels are already scarcely used, and golden shovels may be seen as a waste of resources. Instead, craft this tool and the other golden tools, you won't have to pick up or carry around flint.
- **[Pitchfork](#)**: Many players may have already discovered this almost overpowered tool in adventure mode, considering that all tiles are flammable. This tool is especially useful during winter, as the tiles can be carried around as fuel or simply burned as a source of heat.
- **[Hammer](#)**: This tool helps you to recollect some of the resources used to craft structures. It can also hammer down certain set pieces for some extra resources. It is further explained later.
- **[Razor](#)**: For shaving off the beard as Wilson, or shaving Beefalo for resources and fuel, and easily **[Prototyping](#)** for sanity gain. Easy recipes such as this are recommended to be kept for later when crossing insanity obelisks.
- **[Feather Pencil](#)**: Easy sanity gain.
- **[Saddlehorn](#)**: Sanity gain
- **Salt lick**: Like many other structures, this structure can be crafted and hammered later. By hammering down this one, one board is regained.

## Light Tab

- **[Miner Hat](#)**: Reminder for new players: this item allows emergency light and a way to complete **Darkness** faster. Note: in **Darkness**, it's all about speed. For newer players, it's your resources against Maxwell's final attempt to reach him.
- **[Pumpkin Lantern](#)**: Almost useless as a light source for it has to be placed down, not to mention the small light radius. It is recommended, for sanity, to craft these more difficult recipes since every recipe can only be prototyped once for 15 Sanity. If you are lucky enough to harvest a pumpkin from the basic farm in the Metal Potato setpiece, the rest is easy.

## Survival Tab

- **[Bird Trap](#)**: Easy Sanity and food
- **[Bug Net](#)**: collect fireflies
- **[Fishing Rod](#)**: It's useless when you need it the most when you are low in food during winter and the ponds are frozen. That's the point. Its extraordinary simple recipe can be saved until **Darkness** chapter for a quick boost of sanity after crossing Insanity Obelisks.
- **[Umbrella](#)**: Saves you some sanity in **A Cold Reception**
- **[Compass](#)**: Sanity gain, and is pretty much useless in Sandbox Mode in vanilla Don't Starve.
- **[Tent](#)**: Structure that can be hammered down for resources or slept in.
- **[Bundling Wrap](#)**: This item is overpowered in Adventure Mode. It allows you to take a maximum of 16 items into the next chapter, as opposed to the 4 slots in the **[Wooden Thing](#)** (Telepotato).

## Food Tab

- **[Basic Farm](#)**: structure
- **[Farm|Advanced Farm](#)**: structure
- **[Drying Rack](#)**: Makes jerky, which is useful preparation for **Darkness**.
- **[Ice Box](#)**: Used for storing food in chapters newer players are going to stay in for a while, and also storing **[crock pot](#)** foods (which usually spoils fast).

## Science Tab

- **[Divining Rod](#)**: prototype it for sanity
- **[Thermal Measurer](#)**: Structure that can be placed and hammered down later
- **[Rainometer](#)**: Structure
- **[Gunpowder](#)**: Prototype for sanity, can be used to get flint for pickaxe in case of emergency
- **[Lightning Rod](#)**: Structure, can be used to avoid lightning in longer Adventure Mode chapters.

## Fight Tab

- **[Grass Suit|Grass suit](#)**: starter, bare minimum armour for new players; especially useful for **Archipelago

# Why are you here?

You've played a few games of Don't Starve, but you often have problems with your real goals? Or you just have problems surviving? In this guide I'm not going to tell you how to play, but open your eyes for the essential gameplay elements in Don't Starve. I won't give you recommendations for characters and for how to build your base, just some tips for how to go ahead in an endless world with only one way of redemption.

_Notice that everything in this guide is my personal opinion and also includes the new Reign of Giants content, if I deal with threats that are irrelevant in the vanilla version, then feel free to ignore them._

## Before I build my base

This is pretty much for the beginners, but everyone has been a beginner once, that's why I can't just skip this step.

When you enter your world start collecting Twigs, Grass and Flint as usual and craft an axe to chop trees. Be sure to collect a full stack of grass and twigs with you and even a full stack of wood. Berries and carrots are also essential to survive, just pick them up.

Craft a pickaxe, but if possible only mine rocks that contain gold, because nitre is not too important right now. You can craft the prototype machine to consume some of the resources and place it wherever you like to - not having to worry if you carry enough resources with you.

Now start exploring the map! What? You do not have your base yet?

Yes, the whole map, or at least its outline. Before starting to build a base, you need to know what the map looks like. The reason therefore is quite simple: The availability of resources is paramount when playing Don't Starve.

Your survival often depends on special items like warm clothing, or a Fridge and many other things that will make your life a lot easier.

That's why you should walk around the edges of the world and get a sense of where the biomes are and where to find and gather resources when you need them. Food is not going to be a problem since berries, carrots and seeds will be found all over the place during your first days.

Do not hesitate to use worm holes since they will help you to explore the world even faster and you will know which worm holes are connected.

This seems to be pretty basic, but will have a great impact on your time management, when things get really serious.

## When things get serious

Once you managed to run a circle (or polygon) you open your map and lean back to just have a look and paste that overview into your mind.

Around 5–10 days passed by, you maybe got attacked by 1 or 2 hounds, but for now they are not too difficult to deal with. You now need to think of a nice position for your base.

> Inner monologue: Hm I might do that over here to take those reeds fast and more often, but over there are some nice rocks and there are a few spider dens and a graveyard

Be sure to know what resources are most important to you:

- How often/ much do I need that resource? (Basics: Twigs, Grass, Wood (And with it Ashes, Charcoal...))
- Can I move the source itself and how tricky is it to do so? (Turfs, Saplings, Spider Dens, Beefalo herds)
- Is the resource renewable or the supply limited? (For example, rocks are gone forever once you mined them)

Keep all of these factors in mind when you place your base somewhere and try to imagine what your home might look like in a couple of days. Get an idea of where to place your buildings and walls and so on. Constructing structures closer to each other will take less space, but makes your base more vulnerable to fire. Just think of how reasonable things can be done and you for sure will get your own solution - else you gonna see what happens when things are messed up.

You will have your own storage system: Where do I store my minerals? Shall I leave my weapons on the ground? How about putting inflammable stuff into that fire-proof chest?

This is one of the parts I really love when playing Don't Starve.

## The Circle of Life - A Festival of Preparation

You got a base with a very nice location, but the fun has just begun. You can't just do what you are up to. Especially in the earlier stages of the game, there are lots of threats that you will be forced to adapt to. Since you don't have so many resources collected yet, it is important to know which preparations should be.

First of all there are the seasons with their specific climates e.g. Cold, Heat, Rain. There is not much to be mentioned. You mine ice for summer, craft an umbrella for rain and shave some Beefalo for warm clothing in winter. But be sure: If you forgot to mine glaciers and summer just begun, you are

- **Choose**: Willow
- **Source**: When Character slow down in the Fog

The **Hamlet** DLC introduces the Fog as a prominent mechanic in **Humid Season**, acting as a short event lasting from 1-3 minutes that occurs outdoors. It is indicated by a thick fog that covers the whole screen, reducing the visible area to a small radius around the player.

Players experience **fatigue** (which is similar to **[Sleeping#Grogginess|Grogginess]** from DST), in which they are weighed down by any wearable items equipped in the Head or Body slot, causing a significant reduction in movement speed of 40% to 60%. This is indicated by the character stating "This [item] is slowing me down" and seeming hunched forward as they move. Removing any items in the head/body slots will allow the player to move normally. Three exceptions exist to this, which both exist to negate the fatigue caused by fog: The **Pith Hat** or **Cowl** worn on the head, allowing the use of the body slot; and the **Weevole Mantle** worn on the body, allowing the use of the head slot. Using these two items in conjunction during Fog has no added bonus. (**Wagstaff** 's **Spectoggles** and items crafted from Spectoggles crafted in the tinkering tab also prevent **fatigue**)

Players will also experience a high increase in **Wetness** as the event progresses, due to the high "humidity" of the air. Wetness in the Fog increases 40% slower than in Rain. This cannot be reduced by any means unless **Purple Grouper** or **Tropical Bouillabaisse** is eaten, one runs for shelter into **[:Category:interiors|interiors]**, or is near a working **Oscillating Fan**. Tools such as **Umbrella**s or waterproof clothing are useless in this instance.

Once the Fog clears, heavy **rain** will occur for another 1-3 minutes, causing increased wetness **unless** the player is drying off inside the aforementioned shelters. After this, weather will return to being clear, and players may resume their activities with ease or dry off to reduce their wetness.

## Prototype Tips
- In the **Hamlet** DLC, outdoor exploration is dangerous during Fog due to the limited view. If a player wishes to explore, they are advised to carry the most basic minimums they require to explore, and to not equip any equipment to increase the player's mobility. However, this can be averted if the player uses a Pith Hat or Weevole Mantle.
  - **Webber** players should be cautious when removing their **Shamlet Mask** (to reduce fatigue) near **Royal Guard**s or neutral enemies such as **Pog**s, as they can start to attack the player once it is taken off.
- Players are advised to utilize an **Umbrella** or waterproof clothing (such as the **Snakeskin Hat** or **Snakeskin Jacket**) to reduce wetness from post-fog Rain.
  - If one becomes very wet, quickly find land/shelter and place down a **fire** source to reduce the Wetness sanity drain (or additional damage, in

# Lua

Lua is a lightweight scripting language that is used by the game engine which runs **Don't Starve**. The core game is written in C++, although all game prefabs and modifications for the game are written in Lua. Lua is free to download and is released under the MIT license. To learn more about Lua, visit the official website at [Lua.org](http://www.lua.org). This typed scripting language is compact enough to fit on a variety of platforms. It supports only a small number of data structures such as [boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki:Boolean_data_type) values, numbers, and [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)). Lua implements a small set of advanced features such as [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function), [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)), [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)), proper [tail calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_recursion), [coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion) (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) (cooperative multitasking) and dynamic module loading.

**Don't Starve** and **Don't Starve Together** use a slightly modified version of Lua 5.1.4.[^1]

## Trivia

- "Lua" is not an acronym; it is the Portuguese word for "moon".
- Lua is used in other games for content creation such as **Garry's Mod**, [The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac:_Rebirth), and **Empire: Total War**.

# Wickerbottom

## Special Power: Books
Wickerbottom can craft her Magic Books with Papyrus and other different ingredients. She can read these for beneficial effects, but at the cost of a lot of Sanity. The Books that she can craft are:

- **Horticulture, Abridged** - When read, up to 10 plants that grow edible will advance to the next stage. Farm plants grow completely but cannot give giant plants.
- **Applied Silviculture** - When read, all plants that do not grow edible advance to max stage of their growth.
- **The Angler's Survival Guide** - When read near the Ocean, a shoal of fish spawns nearby.
- **Pyrokinetics Explained** - Burning or smoldering objects in a radius will be extinguished and Wickerbottom will receive a Fiery Pen with the amount of uses being equal to the amount of objects put out, gets more durability for objects on fire, less for smoldering objects.
- **Overcoming Arachnophobia** - Creates web that slows mobs on it and lasts for 2 minutes.
- **Tempering Temperatures** - Sets temperature of all players in radius to 35 and dries them and their items off.
- **Lux Aeterna** - Creates a beam of light with a radius of approximately 3 tiles, lasts 4 minutes, also causes an earthquake when read in the caves.
- **Practical Rain Rituals** - Toggles rain on or off; when standing directly on top of farm soil it gets fully saturated with water instantly.
- **Lunar Grimoire** - The current or following night will be transformed into a full moon, unless it already is.
- **Apicultural Notes** - Spawns 2 loyal Grumble Bees as followers, up to 16 total.
- **Horticulture, Expanded** - Similar to Horticulture, Abridged, the limit is increased to 15 (up from 10), farm plants gets their nutrients and tending need maximised.
- **The Everything Encyclopedia** - Unlocks ability to prototype items 1 tier higher for all players in the radius.
- **Lux Aeterna Redux** - Same as Lux Aeterna but lasts 2 days.

The Books can be read a maximum of 5 times each and drain 33 or 50 Sanity with each reading session. This is somewhat offset by Wickerbottom's higher maximum Sanity, but eventually some Sanity restoring means will be required for continued usage of the Books.

## Bookcase
[Main|Bookcase]

## Science level
Wickerbottom can make all Science Machine recipes without having to build the Science Machine, but does not gain the 15 Sanity per prototype for those since she already knows them at the start of the game. The rest of the recipes can be prototyped with a Science Machine even though they would normally require an Alchemy Engine. Therefore, only a Science Machine is needed to unlock all Science recipes for prototyping. The one exception is the book "On Tentacles" - she needs an Alchemy Engine to prototype it. This free tier of knowledge does not apply to Magic research machines though.

## Insomniac
Wickerbottom lacks the ability to sleep due to her being an insomniac. Including restore structures like Tent, Bed Roll, Fur Roll or Siesta Lean-to and Hypnotic effect like Bearger. This means that crafting those Items and Structures would be a waste of resources and the player will need other means to restore Sanity.

## Spoiled Food
She also hates spoiled Food, causing her Sanity to suffer greatly. Eating stale food costs her no Sanity, but neither does it restore any. Stale Food also restores less Hunger and no Health than fresh Food of the same type. Raw Food has no penalties outside of its normal ones (e.g. Green Caps) if it is fresh.

| Stage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Green (Fresh) | Restores the full amount of Hunger, Health and Sanity for a given Food |
| Yellow (Stale) | Restores 1/3 (normally 2/3) of Hunger, doesn't restore any Health, or Sanity |
| Red (Spoiled) | can't eat |

## Others
Wickerbottom's favorite food is Surf 'n' Turf, meaning that she gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming the food.

## Prototype Tips
See also|Guides/Character guide - Wickerbottom's Books

- During the early days, it is advised to craft a Backpack and Shovel as soon as possible to start storing dug Grass Tufts, Saplings and Berry Bushes for the player's future base, saving them the time to go back and acquire these items.
- Having early access to variety of books is valuable, therefore setting the base in reasonable proximity to Swamps is a good strategy, and visiting Swamps frequently is a requirement to use Books reliably.
- Eating Cooked Green Caps is

# Worker

![Worker](Pig Worker.png){width=150}

## Structure Infobox

- **Naughtiness**: 6
- **Health**: 250
- **Damage**: None
- **Drops**: Meat (75%), Pig Skin (25%), Hammer (100%)
- **Walk Speed**: 3
- **Run Speed**: 5
- **Special Ability**: Gives 2x Oinc for Boards, Rope, Cut Stone, Papyrus
- **Spawn From**: Town House, damaged City buildings
- **Spawn Code**: "pigman_mechanic"
- **Name**: Worker

## Quotes

- Wilson: Mr. Fix-it.
- Willow: He fixes machines.
- Wolfgang: Little piggie fix things.
- Wendy: Can you mend my heart?
- WX-78: A MECHANIC. THE NOBLEST PROFESSION
- Wickerbottom: The community handyman, I believe.
- Woodie: Never understood gizmos myself.
- Maxwell: That is no gentleman.
- Wagstaff: A wonderful work ethic. He would fit in nicely in my factory.
- Wigfrid: A pig which repaireth many things.
- Webber: He looks busy.
- Walani: Hey, you any good at waxing a board?
- Warly: Not the 'fixins' I'm used to, but handy nonetheless.
- Woodlegs: Whut a snout ye have.
- Wilba: HE FIXETH STUFFS
- Wormwood: Fix things?
- Wheeler: Swell. He can fix a house but not a balloon.

## Behavior

The Worker is a Pig Trader Mob exclusive to the Hamlet DLC. Found in the Pig Village, he buys refined items such as Boards, Ropes, or Cut Stone for two Oincs. If a nearby town building is damaged, such as being burned, a Worker will come to repair it using their Hammer.

### Diurnal Behavior

1. One Worker may spawn from a Town House and will wander randomly around their house and eat any edible items left on the ground, including Pig Skin. Every so often they will drop one Manure where they are standing, and if the player picks up that manure the Worker will approach them and give them one Oinc, along with an accompanying Quote.
2. Whenever there is a hostile mob nearby, or a player targets them or another Pig Trader or Royal Guard near them, they will enter a panicked state. They will begin to move around semi-randomly in a direction away from the aggressor.
3. They will attempt to return to their house in the evening, and if they cannot reach their house or their house is destroyed they will seek the nearest light source and stand next to it until night, when they will sleep on the ground.
4. Workers may spawn when buildings take damage if there is not already a Worker present, appearing just off screen before walking towards the damaged structure to repair it. After they have spawned they act as normal Pig Traders, although without a Town House to return to.
5. When a Worker Pigman dies before fixing the broken structure it was supposed to, a new Worker will spawn after a while and but not instantly. Worker pigman does not spawn to repair player built structures.

# How to Survive Indefinitely on a Lights Out World in Don't Starve

## Introduction

This guide will show you how to survive indefinitely on a Lights Out world. This guide works for vanilla **Don't Starve**, **Reign of Giants**, and **Don't Starve Together**.

## What is a Lights Out World?

A Lights Out world is essentially a normal world with no day, no dusk, and you start out with some supplies. It is the hard mode of the Don't Starve series.

## Don't Starve

### Choosing Characters

Good characters to choose would be **Willow**, **Maxwell**, **Woodie**, or **Wendy**. I usually play **Wickerbottom** as her advantage at the start of a 250 Sanity pool and already having backpack and shovel learned can get you ahead quickly early. However, because she can't sleep you will have to get constant sanity boosting foods and utilize Flowers and Top Hat + Winter Vest combo until you get your food supply set up.

### Starting Items and Actions

You're going to spawn next to a **Campfire** and a **Chest** containing 6 **Cut Grass**, 3 **Flint**, 6 **Twigs**, 3 **Logs**, 1 **Gold**, and an **Axe** at 100% durability. Grab the items, and chop down some **Trees** in the vicinity to fuel the fire. Once you have enough **Logs** to make a campfire, pre-build one.

If you're not **Willow**, make a **Torch**. Once you have a light source, wander around collecting essential items such as Flint, **Rocks**, **Berries**, and especially Twigs and Cut Grass, because if you don't, your torch will run out, resulting in **Death** by **Charlie**.

### Base Building and Resources

Making a **Garland** out of petals from picked flowers will take 1/3 of the constant drain of night off which helps (Especially with the 60 sanity regained from picking the flowers) until you can afford **Silk Hats**, but keep the rest of your petals for **Rot** to transplant. If you come across a **Boulder**, you can either place your pre-built campfire and make a **Pickaxe** to mine it, or equip your **Pickaxe** and hold space bar until you hear it hit 6 times then quickly right-click your torch and collect.

### Tips for Survival

- A suitable place to build your base can be in many different locations, such as near a **Pond** for fishing, near a **Sinkhole**, or near some **Pig Torches**.
- Once you have your **Firepit**, you're going to want to start growing **Trees** near your base. 15-25 Trees need to be growing at all times if you want to keep that fire going indefinitely with Logs.
- After you build a **Science Machine**, prototype a **Shovel**, it will let you dig up **Grass Tufts**, **Saplings**, and **Berry Bushes**.
- Once you have that done, you're going to need to work on a safe renewable way to keep your **Hunger** up. **Berry Bushes**, **Crockpots**, and **Drying Racks** plus a few **Spider Dens** for **Monster Meat** will be crucial.
- You're going to need **Spider Eggs** to plant your own **Spider Nest**, this is necessary as you need the **Silk** for **Top Hat**'s or **Winter hats**, bug nets and fishing poles, and the monster meat can be helpful as well.

## Late Game (Don't Starve Together)

If you have found a way to successfully become self-sustained, there is a very risky but rewarding survival method involving the **Star Caller's Staff** and the **Moon Caller's Staff**.

## Lights Out "Hardmode" - Caves-Only Challenge

Once you get used to Lights Out Game mode and are looking for more of a challenge, this is sure to be quite difficult. First, set Lights Out then turn all world customization settings to none, except for Sinkholes and Rabbit Holes.

## Bugs and Additional Tips

- During a full moon, there will not be light. To fix this, exit and reload the world.
- "Flickering" a Torch with 100% in vanilla DS will not cost durability allowing for an infinite light Torch (Although it is very unreliable)
- After reloading the world, there will be light until exactly one night **after** the full moon is supposed to end.

**Note**: This Guide Is A Work In Progress, It Has A Few Problems, I

# Maxwell Statue

## Overview
The **Maxwell Statue** is a naturally-spawning **Structure** that can be found in all worlds of **Adventure Mode** and rarely in **Sandbox Mode** in various **Set Pieces**. It can be mined with a **Pickaxe**, **Opulent Pickaxe**, or **Pick/Axe** to obtain **Marble**. **Gunpowder** and **Slurtle Slime** can also be used for the same effect. It is also used by **Maxwell** to lock **Wes** in an invisible chamber.

## Details
- **Image**: 
  - Common: ![Maxwell Statue.png](<gallery>)
  - Overgrown: ![Overgrown Maxwell Statue.png](<gallery>)
- **Tool**: Can be **Mined** with a **Pickaxe**
- **Resources**: **Marble** x2-3, **Sketch** (for **Statue Formal Marble**)
- **Renew**: No
- **Biome**: **Chess**
- **Spawn Code**: "statuemaxwell"
- **Image Width**: 151px

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "He's a lot shorter in person."
- **Willow**: "A big stone nerd."
- **Wolfgang**: "Ha ha! Looks just like Wolfgang's new friend!"
- **Wendy**: "Did it go as you planned?"
- **WX-78**: "ALL THAT POWER AND HE COULDN'T EVEN DESTROY HUMANITY"
- **Wickerbottom**: "He's actually quite a sweet boy when you peel away the ego."
- **Woodie**: "I'm gonna make fun of him for this later, eh?"
- **Maxwell**: "It seems silly now..."
- **Wigfrid**: "The villain turns herö!"
- **Webber**: "We're still a little mad at him. But only a little."
- **Winona**: "So THIS is 'Maxy'."
- **Warly**: "He is literally made of stone."
- **Wortox**: "My old imp friends would like this, I think."
- **Wormwood**: "Alive?"
- **Wurt**: "Look sort of like fragile scale-less man."
- **Walter**: "I'm starting to think that Maxwell guy might be a bit full of himself."
- **Wanda**: "Someone" had far too much time on his hands..."
- **Choose**: maxwell

## Mechanics
- If the player destroys the Maxwell Statue that is present in the final chapter of Adventure Mode (Epilogue: Checkmate), 3-4 **Clockwork Monsters** will spawn around the statue, and the player's sanity level will drop to 0 immediately. The player must kill all the mobs to restore sanity.
- Maxwell Statue is more common in Sandbox Mode and is usually found in small **Chess Biome** Set Pieces guarded by Clockwork Monsters. The **Old Bell** and the **Weather Pain** can also be used to destroy the Statue.
- Mining the Maxwell Statue will additionally drop a **Sketch** for **Sculpting** a **Kingly Figure**. Mining the statue also unlocks the chess piece in the world, allowing **Tumbleweeds** to drop the sketch. Because of the **Story Line** progressing, characters have different quotes for the statue. Also, instead of the usual statue, an overgrown statue of Maxwell may appear.

## Trivia
- This structure was added in **Version History#A Little Rain Must Fall** Update, but only naturally generated following the **Version History#Doorway to Adventure** Update.

# {{Pic|32|Tallbird Egg}} Hatching

![WX with two Smallbirds](WX_with_two_Smallbirds.jpg "WX with two Smallbirds.")

Tallbird Eggs can be obtained from a Tallbird Nest. If the nest is empty, the Tallbird will lay another egg within two days. Stealing an egg with no armor can result in death, as the Tallbird will chase its target for nearly two screens (in some rare cases, Tallbird will chase you indefinitely).

After obtaining the egg, it must be placed on the ground for it to begin to hatch. If the egg begins to shiver, especially during the night, move it near a fire. A Tallbird Egg that stays cold turns into Wet Goop. Conversely, putting it too close to a fire, especially during the day will turn the Tallbird Egg into a Cooked Morsel as a result from overheating. If it begins to sweat and turn red, move it away from sources of heat. Take care of (and defend) the egg; Pigs, Spiders, Hounds and other carnivores will eat the egg.

While unhatched, the Tallbird Egg can also be safely transported in your inventory in case of hungry Mobs or if you are going to travel. The hatching progress will not be reset after picking it up, but the egg will not continue to hatch until you place it again.

## {{Pic|40|Dont_Starve_Emoticon_dssmallbird}} Smallbird

![Safety precautions](Smallbird_safety.jpg "Safety precautions.")

After three days of care the Tallbird Egg will hatch into a Smallbird. The bird will need to be fed after it hatches. Collect Seeds and Berries beforehand. It is not recommended to hatch an egg during the Winter, unless there is an ample amount of food.

The Smallbird cycle lasts 10 days. Smallbirds must be fed or they will starve. It is recommended to feed them Seeds, as they only require 20 points of hunger per day, or 6 Seeds per day. Smallbirds will follow the player, but it is not recommended to take it on trips. They may also be fed berries, meat, rot, etc.

Attacking Hounds and other enemies can easily kill a Smallbird. A small pen can be built to protect the Smallbird from enemies. Enough seed or berries should be left in the pen before closing it up. Smallbirds will let out a battle-cry (chirping) when threatened, so being enclosed in a pen will increase its chances of survival, as the player can fend off any enemies.

Pig Houses and Rabbit Hutches can also be used as a backup to help fend off attackers, especially if a pen isn't available.

## {{Pic|28|Teenbird}} Smallish Tallbird

The Smallish Tallbird cycle lasts 18 days. Smallish Tallbirds must be fed three times as much food as a Smallbird or they will starve. Failing to feed them will cause the Smallish Tallbird to attack the player until it is fed. They may also be fed berries, meat, rot, etc. They will follow the player, but not in caves. Smallish Tallbirds have a much better survivability against aggressive mobs, but groups of Hounds and Spiders can make short work of a Smallish Tallbird, requiring you to keep an eye on your bird. After 18 days, it will become a fully grown Tallbird and become aggressive toward the player. You can sometimes see a Smallish Tallbird and a Tallbird attacking each other if in close proximity to each other.

# Note: This guide is based on my experience in the game and may be subjective. -- [[User:Neoma|Neoma]]

----

## Incomplete
*Reason: as the major editors have become lazy and inactive*

## Instructional

This guide is aimed at helping you survive your first month in-game. This is not the only way to survive the first month, but one of them. Do not feel like this is the only way to survive.
Also check out [[Guides/How to Survive|How to Survive by DUDETTE]].

## Where do I begin?

Try not to hurry to reach the end game. There's no easy way other than cheating, and where is the fun in that? The first few weeks are crucial to your survival, do not lose focus!

## First Things First

- Gather some flint, saplings, and grass first.
- If you can find 3 pieces of flint and 3 sticks, build a [[pickaxe]] and an [[axe]]. You can get more flint by mining rocks. If you only find 1 flint by midday, only build an axe. If you find 2 pieces of flint and some [[boulders]], make a pickaxe and mine them.
- Gather the basic resources: [[flint]], [[logs]], [[rocks]], [[saplings]], and [[grass]].
- If you find [[Gold Nugget|gold]], [[carrot]]s, and [[berries]] along the way, pick them up until you reach 5 carrots and berries. 5 altogether will put you up to full Hunger. The rest will just spoil. Never cook more food than needed either. For example, having both raw and cooked berries just means wasted inventory space.
  - However, it can be useful to leave carrots. They can make a helpful snack when exploring in Winter.
- You should take some pine cones if you have enough space.
*It's better to pick an optimal location than to settle on the first day!*

## Be Prepared

Gather and carry resources when you can.

Prepare a [[campfire]] when you have enough materials. (Or, if you want to consume less resources, make a couple of torches; you can explore by night.) How can you prepare a campfire, you ask? By building the item and clicking your right mouse button, the item will not be placed and will just be stored in your game tab. The resources are consumed and you can continue to gather more without making more stacks. Do not place the campfire during the daytime. When you want to place your campfire, you simply need to go back to the Light tab, and click 'Place', and then build as normal.

Then, when [[Dusk]] arrives, you still have enough time to gather resources.

### What to Do During the First Few Nights

Craft Torches (2 to guarantee you won't run out at night) to explore while it is night time. Check your map time to time to see if there are any resources outside of you field of view at night that you need to harvest. If you have things that need to be cooked, place down a campfire presumably near a few resources if possible.

Once you place a campfire near some resources, gather them as soon as you can.

Be sure to cook some food in the campfire and consume it; some cooked food will replenish more hunger than uncooked food, while others can increase the health given or get rid of some debuffs on food. Don't starve. (Do not let [[hunger]] {{Hunger}} get the best of you.)

Before the night ends, prepare another campfire. You will need it for your next journey.

## Be Thrifty

Using resources carefully will go a long way. Do not create a [[fire pit]] on the first night. That's a waste of time and resources. Your current location may not be best for you to settle. However, the fire pit does indeed allow more visibility in the night, and also allows some of your raw food (such as carrots, berries, monster meat and morsels), to be cooked, which will upgrade their hunger, health and sanity replenishment stats.

### A Campfire or a Fire Pit?

If this is your first night, you don't have to make a [[fire pit]] because you're likely not going to settle just yet. Set up a [[campfire]] right before night comes and surround it with some resources, so you can gather them during the night.

If the flame is almost gone, check if the time is nearly morning: do not waste your fuel if morning is about to come. Use one log to fuel the campfire just for the first night but be mindful about the burning time of the [[Fire#Fuel|fuel]] you are using. Do not use them all at once! One log is enough for an

## In-game Day-Night Cycle

Using the default settings, an in-game **Day-Night Cycle** or "day" has sixteen 30-second segments and lasts 8 real-world minutes. **Seasons** have different lengths: Summer and Winter each last 15 days, Autumn and Spring last 20, making an in-game year 70 in-game days or 9<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> real-world hours.

| Game Unit        | Game Time | Real Time      |

| Segment         | 1/16 day  | 30 sec        |

# Summoning Celestial Champion Guide

This guide provides a compact overview of the steps needed to summon the **Celestial Champion**. It assumes that you are already familiar with preparing for and fighting both the Crab King and Celestial Champion.

**Note: Steps 1 and 2 can be carried out simultaneously if you have another person assisting you.**

## Table of Contents

- [Getting Pearl's Pearl and the Pinchin' Winch](#getting-pearls-pearl-and-the-pinchin-winch)
- [Getting the Astral Detector](#getting-the-astral-detector)
- [Finding the three Lunar Altars](#finding-the-three-lunar-altars)
  - [Sanctum](#sanctum)
  - [Altar](#altar)
  - [Tribute](#tribute)
- [Assembling the altars](#assembling-the-altars)
- [The Moonstorm](#the-moonstorm)
  - [Lunar Siphonator](#lunar-siphinator)

## Getting Pearl's Pearl and the Pinchin' Winch

1. Gather the materials needed for **Pearl's Tasks**.
2. Make a boat and sail until you find a **Message in a Bottle**. Use it to reveal Pearl's Island on the map.
3. Start completing Pearl's tasks to gain friendship points.
4. After doing 1 task, trade an **Empty Bottle** with her for the **Pinchin' Winch** blueprint.
5. When you've completed 10 tasks, she will give you the **Pearl's Pearl**, after which you can leave.

## Getting the Astral Detector

1. Go to the **Ruins** and craft both a **Star Caller's Staff** and a **Deconstruction Staff**.
2. Place the Star Caller's staff into the **Moon Stone** during a full moon to convert it into a **Moon Caller's Staff**. This resets the durability, so try to use as much of the staff as often as possible before doing the event.
3. Deconstruct the Moon Caller's staff to get an **Iridescent Gem**. Again, use as much of the staff as possible before deconstructing it.
4. Find the **Ancient Archive|Archives**, and socket the Iridescent Gem to activate the Archives.
5. Find and interact with the Blue **Fountain of Knowledge** to get the correct **Distilled Knowledge**. Think of this item like a locked blueprint.
6. Unlock the Distilled Knowledge by placing it on the **Ancient Orchestrina** and solving the puzzle.
7. Craft the **Astral Detector** with 1 Moon Stone and 1 Thulecite.

## Finding the three Lunar Altars

**Finding them in this order is recommended, as the Astral Detector prioritizes detecting in this order.**

### Sanctum

1. Use the Astral Detector on the mainland to locate both parts of the **Celestial Sanctum**.
2. Place both parts on a boat in preparation for traveling to the Lunar Islands.

### Altar

1. Use the Astral Detector to find an **Inviting Formation**, which will be on the **Lunar Island**.
2. Mine all three **Inviting Formations** to get the three pieces of the Lunar Altar.

### Tribute

1. Find **Crab King** with the Astral Detector.
2. Kill Crab King with Pearl's Pearl socketed. Then, use the Pinchin' Winch to get the **Celestial Tribute**.
3. Put the Celestial Tribute on your boat, along with the Celestial Sanctum.

## Assembling the altars

- On the Lunar Island, assemble each altar over a **Celestial Fissure**. Note that the Celestial Fissures must be in a rough triangle.
- If done correctly, the **Mysterious Energy** will appear within the triangle. Additionally, the **Moonstorm** will begin.

## The Moonstorm

1. Enter the Moonstorm.
2. Find Wagstaff, who will give you the blueprint for the **Lunar Siphonator**. You'll also get a blueprint for the **Astroggles**, which are highly recommended for navigating the Moonstorm.

### Lunar Siphonator

- The Lunar Siphonator's only purpose is to be placed on the Mysterious Energy and upgraded.
- While the Lunar Siphonator has three upgrade stages, it's more efficient to get all the necessary materials and then do all three stages at once.
