# Eye of Terror

## Mob Info
![Phase 1](Eye of Terror Phase_1.png) ![Phase 2](Eye of Terror Phase_2.png)  
**Health:** 5000  
**Damage to Player:** 62.5  
**Damage to Mobs:** 125  
**Walk Speed:** 4.5  
**Run Speed:** 15 (phase 1) / 18.75 (phase 2)  
**Sanity Aura:** -100  
**Special Ability:** Spawns Suspicious Peeper  
**Drops:** 2-4 Monster Meat, 3-5 Milky Whites, Eye Mask, Sketch for Eye of Terror Figure (Marble)  
**Spawn Code:** "eyeofterror"

## Quotes
- Wilson: Go for the eye!
- Willow: What's your problem? Quit staring!
- Wolfgang: Wolfgang not like big scary eye!
- Wendy: Beware the evil eye.
- WX-78: INITIALIZING "POKE" PROTOCOLS
- Wickerbottom: Oculus dexter or oculus sinister, I wonder? I have a suspicion it's the latter.
- Woodie: Feast your eye on my axe!
- Maxwell: Don't look at me, it's definitely not one of mine.
- Wigfrid: Be it the plucked eye of Odin himself, returned for revenge?
- Webber: We don't like the look of that...
- Winona: Yeesh, what an eyesore.
- Warly: That eye has a hungry look to it...
- Wortox: Whatever he says I did, it's a lie!
- Wormwood: Biiiig peeper!
- Wurt: Glurp...
- Walter: Wow! Do you think it escaped from a giant head?
- Wanda: I don't think that's supposed to be here...

## Behavior
Upon spawning, the Eye of Terror charges toward the player, dealing area of effect damage, then spawns one Egg of Terror which will hatch into a Suspicious Peeper. The Eye of Terror will repeat this pattern of attack until its HP drops below 3250, at which point it reveals its mouth and enters its second phase.

During its second phase, the Eye of Terror attacks in a pattern of charging 3-5 times consecutively, then spawning two Eggs of Terror at once instead of the previous one. The Eye of Terror also gains a slam attack that triggers when the player comes too close, creating a small sinkhole in the ground that lasts for 20 seconds, slowing down players who walk on it.

## Strategy
The Suspicious Peepers spawned by the Eye of Terror take some time before they hatch, but killing them should always be a priority before they hatch, as they can quickly overwhelm the player.

# Twins of Terror

The Twins of Terror, or The Twins, are two entities, Retinazor and Spazmatism, who spawn instead of the Eye of Terror if the Terrarium is fueled with one Nightmare Fuel before activating it. They have nearly identical attacks to the Eye of Terror but have 10,000 HP each, and both entities enter their second phase when they lose 7000 HP in total.

Unlike the Eye of Terror, the Twins do not regenerate HP if a night is skipped without spawning them. Once they have been summoned at least once, if a single night is spent without summoning them again, the Terrarium immediately enters its dormant state, and cannot be activated for another 15 days.

He released the cart by cutting the Knot with a knife, and went on to conquer much of Asia Minor, before his army rebelled. It has since become a metaphor for solving a complex problem with a simple solution, by thinking outside of the box.

**Shark Fin Soup** is a [Crock Pot] recipe introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is made from 1 **Shark Fin** and 3 fillers. Because Shark Fin Soup has a higher priority than **Monster Lasagna**, multiple **Monster Foods** can be used as a filler, without the risk of getting Monster Lasagna as the result.

If a **Wobster** is also added, adding **Ice** or **Butter** will yield **Lobster Bisque** or **Lobster Dinner** respectively. Adding **Meats** of value 2 and another **Fish** item will yield **Surf 'n' Turf** instead. Adding Fishes of value 1 and **Ice** may yield **Ceviche** instead. Adding **Jellyfish**, **Ice** and a **Twig** may yield **Jelly-O Pop** instead. Adding exactly 2 raw **Seaweed** may result in **California Roll** instead.

Shark Fin Soup restores 40 **Health** and 12.5 **Hunger** at the cost of 10 **Sanity** and raises **Naughtiness** by 10 points.

## Recipe
- **Item 1:** Shark Fin
- **Item 2:** Filler
- **Count 2:** 3
- **Tool:** Crock Pot
- **Result:** Shark Fin Soup

## Examples

## Planting
Pine Cones can be planted to grow into Evergreen trees. It takes from 7.5 to 10 game hours for them to grow from saplings into small trees. They can also be used as a low-level fuel item. Planted saplings will not appear on the map until they have progressed into the small tree stage.

## Treeguard Calming
Planting Pine Cones can calm and put to sleep nearby Treeguards, whether or not they are aggressive. The chance of this happening is a maximum of 33% when planted near the Treeguard, with a lower chance when planted farther away. The Treeguard will groan in acknowledgement when a Pine Cone is planted within range, even if it has already been pacified.

## Winter's Feast Event
During the Winter's Feast event, Pine Cones can be planted in the Festive Tree Planter to create a Winter's Feast Tree. Like regular Evergreens, they take four stages to grow, however, once they are fully grown, they will stop their life cycle.

Glommer's Wings are a nonperishable [Item] dropped by [Glommer] and used to craft the [Old Bell]. It is renewable as the player can obtain one each [Full Moon] by killing Glommer.

The Wings can also be used as fuel for fires or the [Ice Flingomatic].

Because Glommer's Wings can be burned to ash, killing Glommer with fire is ill-advised.

## Trivia

In [Don't Starve Together], since the [Old Bell] was removed, Glommer's Wings can only be used as fuel for fire.

- Choose: Walter

### Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Wes can give his Pile o' Balloons to a Catcoon in order to befriend it. If the Catcoon dies, he will be able to get it back.

### Tips
- Balloons only pop when triggered and won't go away otherwise. This makes them a useful bait to place in the center of a Tooth Trap field for Hounds or other hostiles.
- Because of the 5 sanity drained with each balloon, using this item is a reliable way to go insane if the player wishes to farm Nightmare Fuel. Crafting balloons is especially an easy way to mitigate Enlightenment.
- Speedy Balloons are useful in early game when playing with other people, as they can be given to other players.
- Party balloons have the identical crafting recipe to regular balloons. Unless regular balloons are desired for their aesthetics, crafting party balloons is almost always a better option as they can later used by Wes or other characters as a source of sanity.
- Wes can take advantage of sanity giving actions such as Prototyping, Sleeping and Reviving Players to craft more balloons beforehand. This is especially useful for party balloons as they can be stored together for a sanity boost in the future.

### Trivia
- Wes got his Pile o' Balloons with the Strange New Powers update.
- Wes can pop his balloons to damage himself, and it takes 15 balloons to kill him from full health in DST.
- In DST, Wes' Pile o' Balloons used to be craftable in the Survival Tab before his rework.
- Six possible colors of the balloons correspond to the colors of the six elemental gems in the game.

# Stinger

A **Stinger** is an item commonly dropped by a Bee or Killer Bee when killed. It is an ingredient in Sleep Darts.

## Obtaining Stingers
Stingers can be obtained by either killing Bees or Killer Bees with Weapons, or with the help of other Mobs, or by catching Bees or Killer Bees with a Bug Net then murdering them in the inventory. If the player or any mob attacks a Bee (including catching them with the Bug Net) remaining members of the same Bee Hive (or Bee Box) will emerge as Killer Bees and all members of the hive in the vicinity will target the attacker.

As Stingers are a very common drop from Bees and Killer Bees, they can easily become clutter in vanilla Don't Starve and Don't Starve: Reign of Giants, especially given that it is only used for Sleep Darts, and Jet Feathers are tricky to obtain from Crows in the early game and Cut Reeds are dangerous to obtain due to Tentacles lurking in the Marsh. Stingers can also be set on fire to turn them into Ashes.

## Crafting in Don't Starve Together
In Don't Starve Together, Stingers can be used to craft Booster Shots, Boat Patches, and Dock Kits.

The Lavae Egg is an **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It has a 33% chance of being dropped by a slain **Dragonfly**. It may also be acquired when opening a **Loot Stash** with **Klaus**' **Stag Antler**.

It is similar to a **Tallbird Egg**, and can be hatched into an **Extra-Adorable Lavae** by keeping it near a fire for 2 **Days**. If it becomes too cold, it will change colors and break, dropping **Rocks**. Unlike a Tallbird Egg, it cannot be eaten.

It will drop a **Lavae Tooth** when it hatches, which, much like **Chester**'s **Eye Bone** and **Glommer**'s Flower, will cause the Lavae to follow the players as long as the Lavae Tooth is in their inventory.

- **Walter**: That's easy, I know how to tie lots of knots!
- **Wanda**: I'm not going to bother trying to untangle it.

### Lore
The Gord's Knot has a 4.17% chance of being found when digging up a grave. It is a reference to the story in which Alexander the Great was told that whoever could complete the impossible challenge of disentangling Gordian's Knot and release the tethered cart would rule all of Asia. He released the cart by cutting the Knot with a knife, and went on to conquer much of Asia Minor, before his army rebelled. It has since become a metaphor for solving a complex problem with a simple solution, by thinking outside of the box.

### Trading
- Can be traded to the Pig King for 4 Gold Nuggets.
- In the Hamlet DLC, the Gord's Knot can be bought for 1 Oinc at The Flying Pig Arcane Shop in Pig City.

## Behavior

When engaged with a player, the Great Depths Worm will chase them and attempt to bite. Its movement speed is similar to a default character's speed. If it hits, it inflicts 30 thorn damage. It destroys structures and items in its path and pauses to eat certain enemies or items, producing 3 Manure during digestion.

| Flint, Nitr, Monster Meat | 12.82% |

| Bent Spork, Dessicated Tentacle, Orange Gem, Yellow Gem, Green Gem, Thulecite, Fossils | 0.85% |

## Tips

- Players can drop items in front of the worm to make it eat them, creating a window for damage or healing.
- Wanda's digestion attack is particularly dangerous due to her health mechanics.
- Electric damage has a 2.5x damage multiplier against the worm due to its perpetual Wet status.
- WX-78 can equip Electrification Circuits and intentionally get swallowed for massive damage.
- Having the worm eat a teammate or follower can be helpful as it stays still for a longer time.
- The worm cannot traverse Spelunker's Bridge, allowing players to stay on the bridge and use range weapons.
- The worm cannot sleep, be frozen, or teleported.
- Great Depths Worms are the only renewable source of Fossil Fragments.

## Trivia

- The worm can theoretically eat certain NPCs like Crabby Hermit, Corvus Goodfeather, and Wagstaff.
- Quotes and the Scrapbook entry hint at the worm possibly being an extinct species brought back to life.

# The Hallowed Nights 2024 Comic

The web page contains several comic panels and a short poem.

## Secrets

  ![Hallowed Night Record](Hallowed_Nights_Сomic_Hallowed_Night_Record.png?center&thumb=460x460px)

## Poem
```

When loneliness SLITHERS, cold along your spine,

and your flickering light feels crushed by design,

Your existence, a whisper- forgotten, frail-

As though to seek their warmth is bound to fail.

The darkness deepens, Draped with despair,

Yet in your chest, a SPARK still flickers there.

You hear the echoes of laughter long past,

Fighting sleep, chasing moments that couldn't last.

If only for a night, to feel that warmth once more,

To find a hope for tomorrow, enough to restore.

For when together, the Shadows will fade,

And even the lost will find light in the shade.

But for some, there is no solace in another,

For to come too close, your flame they would smother.

Though they smile, it's a mask they wear to hide,

To obscure the darkness that festers inside.

HAPPY HALLOWED NIGHTS!
```

# Lurking Nightmare

- **Health**: 850
- **Damage**: 50
- **Planar Damage (During Rift)**: 20
- **Drops**:
  - Normal: Nightmare Fuel ×2-4
  - Rift: Pure Horror ×2-3, Nightmare Fuel ×1-2
- **Attack Period**: 1.5
- **Attack Range**: 3.5

The **Lurking Nightmare** is a **Shadow Creature** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**.

## During Nightmare Cycle
During the **Nightmare Phase**, the Lurking Nightmare has a 14% chance to spawn from a **Nightmare Light** or **Nightmare Fissure**, regardless of the player's **Sanity**. It has a special horn attack.

## Shadow Rift
If the **Shadow Rift** exists, the Lurking Nightmare spawn chance increases to 31.5%. It gets **Planar Entity Protection** and its attacks deal extra **Planar Damage**. During Shadow Rift, its horn attack will **Knockback** the player and knock the player off the **Beefalo**.

## Prototype Tips
Defeat Lurking Nightmares mixed with large groups of other Nightmare Creatures is almost impossible for a single player, the best way to deal with it is to stay away from areas where Nightmare Light or Nightmare Fissure are and wait for the Nightmare phase to end.

## Trivia
- The Lurking Nightmare was introduced in the **Depths of Duplicity** update.

# Map

The Map is used to help navigate the islands of the **The Constant**. Nearly all resources such as **Plants**, **Boulders**, and **Beehives** show up as icons on the Map. Different terrain types (often called **Biomes**) are clearly outlined, along with **Ocean** water. The Map shows **Roads** and **Trails**, as well as world objects such as the **Wooden Thing** or **Maxwell's Door** and built/crafted objects such as **Backpack**s and **Farms**. The map can be zoomed in for better detail, or out to see the entire world. The map is brought to view by pressing **TAB**. Pressing **TAB** again closes the map. On the PS4, the map can be opened by clicking the touch pad. On the Wii U, the map can be dragged onto the gamepad. On the Switch, the map can be opened with **-**, and closed again by pressing **B**.

## Exploration

When a world is first generated, the Map will be black except for the area immediately surrounding the **character**. As the world is explored, the map will be filled in. Generally, everything that can be seen on the screen will be added to the map as it comes into view, except for the corners which are slightly out of range. To be sure something is added, try to get at least half a screen away from it.

## Scrapbook Info
The Rabbit King commands with a Royal decree, your presence be removed no matter your plea.

## Description
Royal Rabbit Enforcers are summoned by the Wrathful Rabbit King as its guards. When the Wrathful Rabbit King starts to fight, it will summon 3 Royal Rabbit Enforcers. For every 60 seconds, if there are less than 3 Royal Rabbit Enforcers, it will summon more Enforcers so there will always be at most 3 alive at the same time. Once the Wrathful Rabbit King is dead, they will lose aggro and leave. If the Royal Rabbit Enforcers get caught in Acid Rain, their attack damage and movement speed will be reduced by 15%, and damage taken will increase by 25%.

## Trivia
The Royal Rabbit Enforcer was introduced in the Depths of Duplicity update.
