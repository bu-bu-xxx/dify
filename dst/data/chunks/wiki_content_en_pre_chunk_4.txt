## Description

The **Glass Cutter** is a craftable **Weapon** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. It can be crafted with 1 **Board** and 6 **Moon Shards**, however doing so requires that the player be near a **Lunar Altar**. It deals 68 damage per hit, the same as a **Dark Sword**.

The Glass Cutter's durability loss is halved when attacking **Shadow Creatures**, **Shadow Merm**s, Maxwell's **Shadow Puppets**, **Shadow Pieces**, **Reanimated Skeleton**s, **Ancient Fuelweaver** | **Unseen Hands**, **Woven Shadow**s and **Shadow Thralls**. This means the Glass Cutter can be used a total of 150 times if it is used exclusively to attack shadows.

## Skins

* **Woven - Elegant Terraprisma**: Introduced in the **"An Eye for An Eye"** update in 2021, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's **Terraria**. Its rarity was **Inspired - Elegant** initially, but received change on August 19, 2022.
  ![Woven - Elegant Terraprisma](Terraprisma Icon.png)  
  *Strike true with hallowed beauty.*  
  [See ingame](Terraprisma Wilson.png)

## Tips

* Paired with **Volt Goat Chaud-Froid** and **Chili Flakes** on a wet target with no damage modification, a Glass Cutter deals 204 damage per hit, making it more powerful than **Gunpowder**. If the player is playing as **Wolfgang** in his Mighty form, it is possible to deal up to 408 damage per hit.

## Trivia

* The Glass Cutter was introduced in the **"Turn of Tides"** update.

# Boulders

Boulders are large rocks commonly found in **Savannas** and **Rockylands**, although they may appear anywhere in the **world**. Their main purpose is to provide **Rocks** when mined. Additionally, Boulders may also provide **Flint**, **Gold Nuggets**, and **Nitre**. Boulders do not respawn; however, Rocks, Flint, Gold Nuggets, and Nitre are renewable resources because they can be found after **Earthquakes** while **underground**.

## Mining

Most kinds of Boulders can be mined using the **Pickaxe**, **Opulent Pickaxe**, or **Pick/Axe**. To do this, click the tool on the Boulder or equip it from the inventory by right-clicking. Once the character has begun to swing the tool at the Boulder, either the LMB or Spacebar must be held or continuously clicked to continue mining.

It takes 6 strikes to mine a Boulder with a Pickaxe and Opulent Pickaxe, and 5 with the Pick/Axe. It depletes a normal Pickaxe's durability by 18%, Opulent Pickaxe's by 4.5%, and Pick/Axe's by 4%.

- In the **A Little Fixer Upper** update, the textures for Moon Rocks, Meteor Boulders and all related items were updated.
- Icons for Gold Vein Boulders were added to the base game in version 345820.

The **Bucket-o-poop** is a craftable **item** from the **Reign of Giants** and **Shipwrecked** DLC. It is crafted using 4 **Logs**, 2 **Bone Shards**, and 3 **Manure**. It is used to maximize the uses of Manure as **Farming#Fertilizers|fertilizer**. It has ten uses; each use decreases its durability by 10%. Despite Manure being able to be used as fuel, the Bucket-o-poop is unable to fuel fires; however, it can still extinguish smoldering objects.

# Year of the Catcoon

![Year of the Catcoon Promo](Year of the Catcoon Promo.png)

## Dates
- **2022:** Jan 27 - Mar 24

## Developer
- **Klei Entertainment**

## Preceded by
- **Year of the Beefalo**

## Succeeded by
- **Year of the Bunnyman**

**Year of the Catcoon** is an event in *Don't Starve Together* that began on January 27, 2022 and ended on March 24, 2022. It is inspired by the Chinese Year of the Tiger, which starts on February 1, 2022 and ends on January 21, 2023. In the Chinese zodiac, each year is related to an animal in a 12-year cycle.

It is similar to the Year of the Gobbler, Year of the Varg, Year of the Pig King, Year of the Carrat, and Year of the Beefalo events, which came in the years before, and shares mechanics with them, such as the Offerings crafting tab, and most crafted items from those events. However, there are several additions and differences to be implemented into this event. Players can revisit this event by setting Events to Year of the Catcoon in the World Customization menu.

## Trade Inn Kitcoon Minigame
During the Year of the Catcoon event, a new minigame was added to the Trade Inn in which the player can raise a baby Kitcoon.

## Tips
- Ticoon may lead the player to potentially dangerous mobs or locations, be aware of the surroundings when following them. Ticoon may also be lightly nudged in another direction, by walking into them, to avoid walking directly into danger when hunting for Kitcoons.
- Ticoon and Catcoons do not get along, be cautious when around Catcoons or they may end up fighting and dying.
- Kitcoons found will follow the player until they are either abandoned or sent home to a Kitcoon Nursery, though they seem similar to Critters in the fact that they avoid any combat and do

- Wormwood: "Bring to opening? Okay!"

- Choose: Webber

## Description
The Seed of Ruin is an item exclusive to **Don't Starve** and its **DLCs** that allows you to completely regenerate the **Caves**. It is dropped by the **Ancient Guardian**.

To use it, you need to go to the **Surface World** and use it on a **Sinkhole**. Afterwards, a message will appear to confirm the complete change of the Caves. If you agree, the Caves will be regenerated.

Unlike the ruins regeneration in DST, the Seed of Ruin completely regenerates the caves to a different seed, as well as the Ruins.

This item essentially makes everything in the Caves, as well as the **Ruins**, renewable.

**Note**: Worlds created before the update, where the Ancient Guardian is already dead, will have a Seed of Ruin appearing somewhere in the ruins.

## Trivia
- The Seed of Ruin was added in the **[Don't Starve Mega Update](April 27th, 2023 "Don't Starve Mega Update")** update.
- The seed completely regenerates caves with ruins, which means that if you forget an item there, then they are deleted (even non-deletable ones such as the **Eye Bone**).

# Monster Meat

## Description
Monster Meat is a type of food item obtained by killing most Monsters. It is toxic and will reduce Health and Sanity when consumed, with the exception of Webber and Wilba, who will not take any penalties upon consumption. Wormwood does not take the health penalty from consuming Monster Meat, but does lose Sanity.

## Cooked Monster Meat
Cooked Monster Meat is Monster Meat that has been cooked on a Campfire, Fire Pit, or Star. Cooking Monster Meat reduces its toxic effects.

| Quotes |
| ------ |
| Wilson: That's only somewhat more appetizing than when it was raw. |
| Willow: It's still gross. |
| Wolfgang: I still do not want to eat this. |
| ... |

## Monster Jerky
Monster Jerky is the product of drying raw Monster Meat on a Drying Rack for 1 Day. It can be given to the Pig King in exchange for a Gold Nugget, unlike raw Monster Meat.

| Quotes |
| ------ |
| Wilson: Strange-smelling jerky. |
| Willow: It's dry and smells strange. |
| Wolfgang: Look like leather, taste like leather. |
| ... |

## Usage
Monster Meat can be used as bait for meat-eating creatures, such as Spiders or Buzzards. It can also be used in various Crock Pot recipes.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked DLCs, Monster Jerky will begin to spoil immediately upon creation on a Drying Rack, regardless of whether it is harvested or not.

## Recipes
1. Monster Meat + Fire = Cooked Monster Meat
2. Monster Meat + Dry = Monster Jerky
3. Cooked Monster Meat + Bird = Egg
4. Monster Jerky + Bird = Egg

## Tips
- While Monster Meat damages health when eaten it still restores a big chunk of durability for both the Eye Mask and the Shield of Terror.
- Monster Meat lasts 15 days when cooked, and only 6 days when it's raw. So it's best to cook it as soon as possible in the early stages of the game to extend its freshness.

## Trivia
- Warly states that the meat has "nice marbling", suggesting that it's rather fatty.
- Contrary to popular belief, WX-78 still takes damage when they eat this.
- Wickerbottom's quote to a Big Woby implies that there is some kind of mutagen in the monster's meat. This may explain the transformation of Woby into a big form, the transformation of pigs into werepigs, and other local abilities of this meat.

# Spider Den

## Overview
A **Spider Den** is a nest where Spiders and Spider Warriors spawn and live. Spiders emerge in search of food at Dusk and return to their Dens at dawn. The number of Spiders that live in a Den varies depending on its size (see table below). When a Den reaches its final stage, it evolves into a Spider Queen. Spider Dens are surrounded by a creep-like substance called Sticky Webbing, which slows down anything caught in it, aside from Spiders. Sticky Webbing will grow on any surface except a small area around a Rabbit Hole.

### Quotes
- Wilson: "Sticky!"
- Willow: "That's just nasty."
- Wolfgang: "The bugs are hiding in there."
- Wendy: "A nest of filth and villainy."
- WX-78: "SPIDER SOURCE DETECTED"
- Wickerbottom: "Fascinating. These spiders have a communal hive."
- Woodie: "Holy Mackinaw! Look at that thing!"
- Maxwell: "They grow big here."
- Wagstaff: "It appears to be growing. Almost as if it were alive."
- Wigfrid: "Crush them at the söurce!"
- Webber: "Looks cozy in there."
- Walani: "They don't like trespassers."
- Warly: "A spider has to live somewhere, I suppose."
- Woodlegs: "I prefur' a den o'thieves."
- Wilba: "HOUSE O' MANY LEGG'D UNPIGS"
- Wormwood: "Home for Leggy Bugs"
- Wheeler: "So rich they lined their walls with silk."
- Winona: "I'd rather not mess with that."
- Wortox: "A leggy surprise awaits inside!"
- Wurt: "Glurgh, stepped in sticky stuff!"
- Walter: "Hey, that must be where the spiders live! It's huge!"
- Wanda: "I'm not in any hurry to tangle with spiders."

## Growth Cycle
A Spider Den has 3 growth stages: 5–10 days in Tier 1, 5–10 days in Tier 2, and 12.5–25 days in Tier 3. Tier 3 Dens will evolve into a Spider Queen after they hit the next stage and the player has been nearby for 60 to 120 seconds. When a Spider Queen spawns, she leaves behind a Tier 1 Den nearby if there are less than 3 other Dens or Spider Queens in 60 radius (15 Terrain Tiles). This new Tier 1 Den will grow into a Tier 2 Den in sixty seconds real time. After wandering to a new location, the Queen will settle down, transforming back into a Tier 1 Den.

## Hunting
A simple method to destroy any Spider Den without taking damage is to utilize Traps. After placing a few traps in a line, stand on the Webbing to attract a few Spiders. Lead them into the Traps and empty them once they are caught. Repeat until the Den is empty. The Den can now be safely destroyed. Beware that a Den can still grow to a higher tier while it's being attacked, instantly restoring all Spiders, including Spider Warriors.

If getting resources is not important, a Den can be set on fire directly with a Fire Dart, Fire Staff, or indirectly by creating nearby fires. The Den will burn to Ashes, but all Spiders inside the Den will come out as soon as the fire is started. These Spiders and any others that were not inside at the time will become homeless and wander about until they are dealt with. For a cleaner job, place some Slurtle Slime or Gunpowder near the Den and light it. The resulting explosion will leave behind a few Monster Meats and some Ashes.

## Sticky Webbing
Sticky Webbing is a Turf that cannot be dug up. It's a creep-like substance which "flows" out of Spider Dens, Spilagmites and Cocooned Trees and slows the walking speed of all creatures (except Buzzards, Spiders and Webber). If the Spider Den or Spilagmite is destroyed, the webbing will quickly disappear.

Sticky Webbing can also be found in Sacred and Labyrinth biomes in the Ruins. The webbing found there has no associated Spider Den or Spilagmites, as it houses Dangling Depth Dwellers, which reside on the ceiling above. Although the nest cannot be attacked like the Spider Den or Spilagmite, it can be destroyed by burning an item in the middle of the webbing (Don't Starve icon only.) This will remove the sticky webbing soon after.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Spider spawns are changed to increase difficulty. During Spring, Tier 2 Dens will house

### Juicy Berry Bushes
Juicy Berry Bushes are **Plants** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. They are a variant of **Berry Bushes**. When generating a new world, either all regular Berry Bushes (including those being part of **Set Pieces**) will be replaced by Juicy Berry Bushes, or no Juicy Berry Bushes will be present at start. The same applies to the **Caves**, though they do not have to share the same berry bush type as the surface world. They can also be spawned randomly on the Wilderness and Endless modes.

When harvesting a Juicy Berry Bush, 3 **Juicy Berries** will fall to the ground, and need to be picked up to be collected. Juicy Berry Bushes need more time than regular Berry Bushes to grow their fruits back (exact time is 9-13 **Days**).

Like regular Berry Bushes, Juicy Berry Bushes have a chance to spawn a **Gobble

# Year of the Carrat

![Year of the Carrat Promo](Year of the Carrat Promo.png)

## Infobox

- **Dates**: 2020: January 23 - March 19
- **Developer**: [Klei Entertainment](https://kleientertainment.com)
- **Preceded by**: [Year of the Pig King](#)
- **Succeeded by**: [Year of the Beefalo](#)

## Overview

**Year of the Carrat** is an event in *Don't Starve Together* that began on January 23, 2020, and ended on March 19, 2020. It is inspired by the Chinese Year of the Rat, which started on January 25, 2020, and ends on February 11, 2021. In the Chinese zodiac, each year is related to an animal in a 12-year cycle.

Similar to the Year of the Gobbler, Year of the Varg, and Year of the Pig King events, it shares mechanics with them, such as the Offerings crafting filter and most craftable items from those events. However, there are several additions and differences to be implemented into this event. Players can revisit this event by setting Events to Year of the Carrat in the World Customization menu.

During the official Year of the Carrat event, the Carrat Torch Skin was given to players upon opening the game.

## Trivia

- The main menu features an animation of Winona holding a winning Carrat, which ear and tail color is randomly chosen each time the player logs in.
- In Rhymes with Play #271, a developer stated that the special theme for this event was inspired by "Gonna Fly Now", the theme from the movie Rocky.
- While training a carrat at any of the gym pieces, the Year of the Carrat theme will play. A reference to training montages, popularized by the above-mentioned movie series.
- Carrats found on the backs of Beefalo and the Carrat races are a reference to the Chinese legend of how the order for the Chinese Zodiac was made.

The **Float Platform** is a type of structures in **Don't Starve Together**. They are round platforms that can move through the **Ocean**, carrying players, **Mobs**, and **Structures**.

## Durability

### Leak
| Image | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ![Small Leak](Boat Leak Small.png) | Small |
| ![Large Leak](Boat Leak Medium.png) | Large |

Float Platforms can take damage by colliding with certain objects in the water such as **Sea Stacks** or **Salt Formations**, coasts, or the border of the world. Any Float Platform moving faster than 1 will destroy what it hits on collision (if it is workable). When **Hull** reaches 0, Float Platforms will sink. When this happens, any structures and plants aboard will be destroyed and Players and non-flying and non-aquatic Mobs will drown.

All Players **drown** and reappear on the nearest coast. Each player-made Boat has a plank, which can be used to abandon ship with the same effects as drowning.

**Bumpers** can be placed around the edge of Float Platforms (except Ice Boat) to protect them from collision damage and leaks, and the **Captain's Tricorn** can reduce the damage of collision and slow the durability loss rate of the Boat by half. This includes the persistent durability loss of Grass Rafts.

### Leaks
Taking damage can create a leak in the boat that does constant damage (-0.5 **Hull**/s per small leak and -1 **Hull**/s per large leak) until a **Boat Patch**, **Trusty Tape**, or **Tree Jam** is used on the leak.

If the above options are not available, a few options can be used to stop the leak temporarily:
1. Stand on the Leak: The Wetness of the player will slowly increase, even when the player has 100% Wetness protection.
2. Drop objects on top of the Leak: The duration of the object stopping the leak depends on its weight. For example, a Cut Stone will hold longer than a rock. After a while, the object will get pushed away. Some objects like **Celestial Orb** and **W.O.B.O.T.** will not get popped off and can stop the leak as long as they are on top of the leak.
3. **Kelp Patch**: It temporarily stops the leak. It lasts 6 minutes on small Leaks and 4 minutes on medium leaks.

## Movement

Float Platforms can be moved by players using **Oar**, **Driftwood Oar**, **Claw Oar**, or **Malbatross Bill**.

Alternatively, **Masts** can be built on a Boat to obtain a constant thrust. The **Steering Wheel Kit** is used to direct the thrust of all equipped masts. An **Anchor Kit** can be built on a Boat to stop or slow down its acceleration.

**Bootleg Getaway** can be used to create a **Whirlportal** that can travel to any place of the Ocean that has been revealed.

Equipping a **Pirate's Bandana** allows the player to more quickly do various boat-related actions. This includes raising and lowering the Mast and raising the Anchor twice as fast as usual. While worn, it also uses only half the durability of an Oar when rowing. The Pirate's Bandana also makes you turn Steering Wheels more quickly.

# Survive and Thrive in the Constant (WIP)

Welcome to the constant survivor. Below you will find a variety of guides to help you survive in the constant of **Don't Starve Together**. I am not going to explain characters in this guide because it creates massive amounts of variability. This guide is being made assuming you are playing **Wilson** or understand how to translate this guide into other characters.

## Finding food and tools

This step is often done at the same time for most players so we will assume the same thing. Notably each character loses 75 hunger each in game day. You have a vast swath of food sources wildly available in the early game. Some notable foods found early game are...

- ![Carrots](Carrots.png)**Carrots**
- ![Berries](Berry.png)**Berries**
- ![Juicy Berries](Juicy Berries.png)**Juicy Berries**
- ![Butterfly Wings](Butterfly Wings.png)**Butterfly Wings**
- ![Morsels](Morsel.png)**Morsels**

While gathering food, you should also be gathering resources for tools and structures. The resources you are looking for are as follows...

- ![Flint](Flint.png)**Flint**: Found in the starter biome.
- ![Twigs](Twigs.png)**Twigs**: Harvested from ![Saplings](Sapling.png)**Saplings**.
- ![Cut Grass](Cut Grass.png)**Cut Grass**: Harvested from ![Grass Tuft](Grass Tuft.png)**Grass Tuft**.

# Coconuts

## Shipwrecked Exclusive

**Coconuts** are a [Fruit] [Food] resource found in the [Don't Starve: Shipwrecked] DLC. They are mainly obtained by cutting down fully-grown [Palm Trees] with an [Axe]. They are dropped by [Palm Treeguards] upon death. Additionally, their ranged attack has a 1% chance to leave an intact Coconut. Rolling three carrots at the [Slot Machine] and, very rarely, digging [Sandy Piles] also has a chance to drop a Coconut.

### Halved Coconut
**Halved Coconut** can be obtained by hacking a Coconut with a [Machete]. Halved Coconuts can be cooked over [fire] to obtain **Roasted Coconuts**. Both Halved and Roasted Coconuts can be eaten directly or used in a Crock Pot and provide a [Crock Pot#Fruit value|food value] of 1 Fruit.

## Description
The **Divining Rod** is a Science item used for assistance in locating both the Things and Maxwell's Door. It must be prototyped at an Alchemy Engine, and costs 1 Twig, 4 Nightmare Fuel, and 1 Gear to craft. In Shipwrecked, it can also occasionally be found in an X Marks the Spot. It resembles a Voxola PR-76 Radio connected to a long, black rod.

The Divining Rod is equipped in the Hand slot. It will periodically create droning noises and radiate colored rings; If the player is getting close to a Thing or Maxwell's Door, the drones become higher-pitched and more frequent, and the rings change color from dull blue to bright red. There is a small chance for the Rod to be struck by Lightning, in which case it will react as if one of the aforementioned is very close.

In Adventure Mode, a Divining Rod placed inside of a Divining Rod Holder will always spawn next to the player in each chapter, with the Holder vanishing shortly after the Rod is taken from it. The Divining Rod is also used to escape the world, by placing it in a Holder next to the Wooden Thing in order to activate the Teleportato, and to complete Adventure Mode, by placing it in the Nightmare Lock to free the current occupant of the Nightmare Throne.

The Divining Rod cannot be stolen by Krampus, Splumonkeys, or Prime Apes, and cannot be eaten by Eyeplants. It cannot be taken into the next world through the Teleportato – if the player attempts to do so, the Divining Rod is reduced to Ash, although they retain the crafting ingredients and can make a new one.

## Trivia
- The Divining Rod was added in The End of the Beginning update.
- Its design utilizes the Voxola PR-76 Radio that Maxwell used to communicate with Wilson in Forbidden Knowledge.
- Divining Rods in real life are branched twigs that were claimed to be used to locate sources of ground water and mineral ores.
- The Divining Rod's sound effects are made by a tanpura, an Indian string instrument used to create drone sounds.
- The Divining Rod's description, "There must be some way out of here...", is a reference to the Bob Dylan song "All Along the Watchtower".
- The Divining Rod is the only non-magical and non-ancient item that requires Nightmare Fuel as part of its recipe.
- In Don't Starve Together, Divining Rod can still be obtained using the c_give or c_spawn command.

### Adventure Mode Quote

> Say pal, you don't look so good. You better find something to eat before night comes! - Maxwell offering advice.

## Origin

Maxwell, whose real name is William Carter, is the main antagonist of the single-player game "Don't Starve". He is responsible for bringing the characters into The Constant, forcing them to survive in the harsh wilderness for his own amusement. As the ruler of the Constant, he appears significantly taller than the survivors and can shape the dimension to his desire. Maxwell's presence is felt throughout the game, especially in the various Chess Set Pieces.

### William Carter Puzzles

Maxwell has much of his backstory revealed in puzzles found outside the game. In 1901, a British man named William Carter boarded a ship from Liverpool to the United States with the hopes of pursuing his career as a magician in New York City. Three years later, William's career had flopped and he was in debt trying to make his magic shows work. It was sometime around this point that William discovered a mysterious book known as the Codex Umbra which contained information on powerful forms of dark magic.

William received a letter from his brother Jack Carter, inviting William to come visit Jack and his family out West. William decided to take up Jack on his offer, and boarded a train traveling west to San Francisco, California. On the way, William's train crashed into a circus wagon and William was trapped under one of the damaged train cars. William was saved by a circus strongman, who attempted to lift the train car off of William and was eventually successful with the help of two Shadowy tendrils that shot out of William's Codex Umbra. William was distressed to have someone witness the dark magic of the Codex Umbra he was carrying, and he fled away from the train crash, going missing and presumed dead.

Out on his own, William deciphered the various symbols inside the Codex Umbra and his mind was opened to new possibilities for magic acts. He gathered this new information and began incorporating it into his magic shows. Soon, William returned to a life of show business under his new stage name: "The Amazing Maxwell".

After settling down with his newly-found alter ego and knowledge, Maxwell hired Charlie as an assistant. Their magic shows appeared to be successful, creating very convincing acts using the knowledge Maxwell acquired from the book he discovered. In 1906, Charlie went to Maxwell's apartment after not hearing from him for a few days, but instead of finding Maxwell she discovered his hidden "study room", with various symbols and incantations crudely scratched on the walls. Among these were the phrases "Enough", "It's them", and "Charlie". She ran away terrified, but came back later to slide a letter under Maxwell's door acknowledging the room and suggesting that they take a break after their last act.

Later that night, Maxwell and Charlie were to perform their big final act, wherein Maxwell would pull a shadow from his mysterious book. When Maxwell reached inside the book to pull a shadow out, something else pulled him in. He managed to break free, but the book, moving of its own volition, turned to a page before grabbing Maxwell and Charlie with huge shadow hands. Soon, they were both pulled into a

## Volcanic Tab
The **Volcanic Tab** is the crafting category introduced in the **Shipwrecked** DLC. It contains all items crafted using **Obsidian**. Recipes in this tab cannot be prototyped; instead, they can only be crafted while near an **Obsidian Workbench** or while wearing a **Brain of Thought**. The Volcanic Tab is the **Shipwrecked** equivalent of the **Ancient Tab**.

Many of the items in this tab are waterproof, with the exception of the **Obsidian Coconade**, the **Howling Conch**, and the **Sail Stick**.

### Craftable Items
The following items can be crafted in the Volcanic Tab:

# Loot Stash

The Loot Stash is a naturally-spawning object exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It can usually be found in the **Deciduous Forest** or in the **Mosaic** Biome. A Loot Stash will spawn 1-3 days after the beginning of every **Winter** or spawn on day 1 during the **Winter's Feast** event. The spawn location of the Loot Stash changes with each passing Winter, it will despawn 1-3 days after the beginning of **Spring** and will respawn at the start of the next winter. (or after 20 days have passed during the Winter’s Feast event.) Attempting to open the Loot Stash with a **Deer Antler** will drop **Bone Shards** and summon **Klaus**. Using the **Stag Antler** on the Loot Stash will properly unlock it, causing it to drop 4 **Bundled Supplies**.

![Loot Stash Original](Loot Stash.png) ![Loot Stash Winter Feast](Loot Stash Winter Feast.png)

# Shadow Manipulator

- **Wanda:** Shadow magic's just a tool, like anything else.

## Crafting Recipes
The Shadow Manipulator allows the prototyping of the following items and structures. Once prototyped, the craftables become unlocked on the Magic Tab, Refine Tab, and will no longer require the player to be next to the Shadow Manipulator to craft.

### Craftable Items
- Meat Effigy
- Shadow Manipulator
- Pan Flute
- One-man Band
- Night Light
- Life Giving Amulet
- Chilled Amulet
- Ice Staff
- Nightmare Fuel
- Purple Gem
- Dark Sword
- Night Armor
- Bat Bat
- Belt of Hunger

- Telelocator Staff
- Telelocator Focus

- Joy of Volcanology
- Dripple Pipes
- Seaworthy
- Root Trunk
- Pugalisk Wand
- Skyworthy

## Downloadable Content
In the Shipwrecked DLC, the Shadow Manipulator can be flooded.

## Tips
- Chopping down a Totally Normal Tree and digging up its stump yields enough Living Logs to craft a Shadow Manipulator without the need to kill a Treeguard. However, making other items such as Dark Swords would require Living Logs.

## Bugs
- In Winter, snow on top of the device disappears with the rising and falling animations (when the player is near).

## Trivia
- The Shadow Manipulator was added in the "A Little Rain Must Fall" update.
- A Shadow Manipulator can be found in the Miner's Camp set piece.
- The Shadow Manipulator was the tier 3 Science research lab before Science and Magic research were separated into different categories.
- In Don't Starve Together, the Clean Sweeper also used to require a Shadow Manipulator to be prototyped until the March 2022 Quality of Life update where it was moved to Science Tier 2 and its recipe was changed from 6 Dark Petals and 3 Living Logs to 4 Petals and 1 Twig.

# Sea Trap

**Exclusivity:** Shipwrecked  
**Item Infobox:**
- **Name:** Sea Trap
- **Ingredient 1:** Palm Leaf (Multiplier: 4)

- **Ingredient 3:** Jellyfish (Multiplier: 1)
- **Tab:** Nautical
- **Tier:** 1
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Durability:** 8 uses

- **Description:** It's a trap for sea creatures.
- **Dropped By:** Blue Whale Carcass, White Whale Carcass, X Marks The Spot, Yaarctopus (exchanged for Jelly-O Pop)
- **Perk:** Catches Wobsters. Can be baited.

**Quotes:**
- Wolfgang: Little pincher does not stand a chance.
- Wilson: For the deadliest catch.
- Willow: C'mon, swim inside! It's cozy in there!
- Woody: I'm looking forward to a wobster dinner.
- Maxwell: The curiosity will get the best of you eventually.
- Wagstaff: I do hope this yields a lobster dinner.
- Wendy: Come, creatures of the sea! Enjoy a lovely snack!
- Woodlegs: Tis' a pirate's lunch fer me!

- Wilba: FOR TRAPPING YON PINCHY MEATS
- Wormwood: Wet trap
- Wheeler: It looks that way so the crustaceans won't recognize that I'm desperate.
- Choose: willow

**Usage:**
Sea Traps are set by placing them in the Ocean and can be picked up again at any time. They will move a bit of distance before settling completely when deployed. Once set, Sea Traps can be baited with Food, which is attractive to Wobsters. Bait will be consumed upon a successful catch, but will be given back if the player picks up the Sea Trap with the bait still in it. Once a Sea Trap has caught a Wobster, it will drop its hook with a cage, with the Wobster in the cage. Sea Traps do not need bait in order to catch Wobsters; if a Wobster touches the Sea Trap for any reason, it will possibly catch it. This means if a Sea Trap is placed directly on top of a Wobster Den, it will catch the Wobster when it leaves home or comes back. When a Sea Trap is picked up from the ocean and is still yet to catch a Wobster, no durability is lost, allowing it to be moved around freely. When a Sea Trap is picked up after catching a Wobster (or failing), it will lose durability. Once a Sea Trap is placed, an icon will become visible on the map where it was placed.

**Tips:**
- It is easy to catch Wobsters quickly without using bait by sailing towards them and deploying the trap such that it hits them as the trap glides forward. Wobsters can also be chased into a trap. Positioning your boat between the Wobster and its den helps prevent it from escaping.
- Besides Limpets, the Sea Trap can be baited with Eggs, any meats including Monster Meat, Roe, Mussels, and any fish but Jellyfish.

## Description
Willow's Lighter is a portable light source exclusive to **Willow**. It can be equipped in the 'Hand' slot and is able to set flammable objects on **Fire**. Used as a weapon, Willow's Lighter deals 17 damage per hit and has infinite uses. Willow's Lighter has a very small radius of light (less than a **Torch**), though it can still prevent attacks from **Charlie**. Willow will receive a small **Sanity** boost from the fire it provides (+0.6/min). It also provides a small amount of **Warmth** (to slow **Freezing**).

## Downloadable Content
In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, Willow's Lighter no longer provides warmth.

## Trivia
- Willow's Lighter was added in the **Strange New Powers** update. It was introduced in the June 25, 2013 preview.
- Before the update, Willow would light small fires at her feet when in complete darkness, making her essentially invulnerable to attacks from Charlie.
- Willow's Lighter is one of the first character-specific items implemented in the game's history.
- It is also the first 'Hand' slot item able to raise Sanity.
- Willow's Lighter is a [lift arm lighter](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&site=imghp&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1517&bih=714&q=lift+arm+lighter&oq=lift+arm&gs_l=img.1.1.0l4j0i5l6.1682.7348.0.9276.8.8.0.0.0.0.895.2322.0j5j2j6-1.8.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.62.img..0.8.2317.Cj5pMaq2krE).
- Coincidentally, there was a manufacturer of these automatic lighters named Willow. [Reference](http://www.toledo-bend.us/VCL/lighters/index.asp?request=lighters211)

## Bugs
- In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, equipping Willow's Lighter while rowing on a **boat** may cause the lighter to still give off light without actually having the lighter equipped. This is fixed by restarting the game or dying.
- In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, if the player has the lighter equipped while rowing a boat, and then leaves the boat, the lighter will not appear equipped and will not give off light. This can

The **Year of the Bunnyman** is an event in *Don't Starve Together* that began on January 20, 2023. It is inspired by the Chinese Year of the Rabbit. In the Chinese zodiac, each year is related to an animal in a 12-year cycle.

This event is similar to the Year of the Gobbler, Year of the Varg, Year of the Pig King, Year of the Carrat, Year of the Beefalo, and Year of the Catcoon events, which came in the years before, and shares some mechanics with them, such as the Offerings crafting tab, and most crafted items from those events. However, there are several additions and differences to be implemented into this event. Players can revisit this event by setting *Events* to *Year of the Bunnyman* in the *World Customization* menu.

## Trivia

- Promo art, as well as animation in the main menu of the event, are a reference to the famous painting *La creazione di Adamo*.
- If one manages to kill a Cozy Bunnyman, they'll drop standard bunnyman loot, alongside their pillow weapon and armor. However, due to their cowardly nature and massive damage resistance, this is virtually impossible without the use of cheats.

The Ice Box is a Food Tab Structure used to store and preserve Food. Items inside will spoil two times slower. It requires 2 Gold Nuggets, a Gear, and a Board to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

Like a Chest, the Ice Box can hold up to 9 items or stacks of food type items. It cannot, however, contain the never spoiling types of food such as Mandrakes or Tallbird Eggs.

When demolished by a Hammer or other means, it returns one Gear, Gold Nugget, and Board, along with any items stored in it.

It is possible to find an Ice Box trap. If the Chest next to the Ice Box is opened, Winter has a chance to immediately begin. The player can safely demolish the Ice Box with a Hammer for its components, but demolishing the Chest can still trigger the trap. If Winter was already in progress when the trap has been triggered, the progress will extend as if it were already around the first day of Winter.

## Downloadable Content
In all DLCs as well as DST, Ice, Hail, Ice Cubes, and Fashion Melons can be stored indefinitely in an Ice Box. Thermal Stones can be chilled if stored. Crafting an Ice Box also costs one Cut Stone instead of Boards.

In the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC, Ice Boxes become renewable due to the 1% chance of Gears dropping from Tumbleweeds. There is also a version of the Ice Box trap that starts Summer instead of Winter. It's distinguishable from the Winter one since it only spawns in a Desert biome. Unlike the Winter trap, opening or hammering the Ice Box or the Chest will have a chance to start Summer.

When playing a Shipwrecked world, an Ice Box can be effected by Flooding. A flooded Ice Box does not slow down the food spoilage rate although it can still be used as storage. Ice Boxes are also easy to renew using Gears from Floaty Boaty Knights.

For Hamlet, Ice Boxes are also renewable with the Gears buyable from the The Sty Oddities Emporiums and from Large Iron Hulks.

## Usage
The following items can be placed in an Ice Box:
- Most Food items
- Ham Bat 🏛️
- Thermal Stone 🏛️
- Ice Cube 🏛️
- Fashion Melon 🏛️

As food spoils faster in the Summer of Reign of Giants, it is recommended to keep food inside an Ice Box to help deal with the increased spoilage rate.

## Tips
- Because destroying an Ice Box returns 100% of Gears used in crafting, extra Gears can safely be used in crafting Ice

## Tips
- When chopped down and dug up, a single Totally Normal Tree will provide enough Living Logs to craft a [[Shadow Manipulator]], without having to summon a [[Treeguard]].

## Bugs
- Burning a Totally Normal Tree's stump will turn it into a Burnt Totally Normal Tree instead of dropping an Ash. These burnt Trees cannot be chopped down; one must use a Shovel to dig it up and receive 1 [[Charcoal]].
