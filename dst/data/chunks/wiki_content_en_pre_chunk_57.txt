The **Pig King** can be found in one of the **Pig Villages** that generally spawn in or on the borders of a **Deciduous Forest** biome, usually at the end of a path. He can be found laying on **Wooden Flooring** surrounded by **Obelisk**s. He is immune to any damage and cannot be attacked.

During the day, the player can make offerings to the Pig King in exchange for **Gold Nugget**s. At **Night**, the Pig King goes to **sleep** and cannot be traded with. He will not hold any grudge towards the player, even if they kill his fellow **Pigs** or his Guardian Pigs. Despite Pigs' hostility to **Webber** and **Wortox**, the Pig King will still trade with them. However, he will refuse to trade with **Wurt**.

## Merm King's Effects

When the **King of the Merms** is alive, all Merms will gain a boost of +60 Health and +10 damage.

### The King's Pauldron Quest
_Wurt_ with **"The King's Pauldron Quest"** skill can give to **Merm King** a **Marble Suit**. If there is a Merm King with Marble Suit, all loyal **Merm**s with head armor will have 15% damage protection. This 15% protection works the same as Warly's **Garlic Powder** protection effect. **Wurt** will also have this effect, but with only 10% of protection.

### The King's Crown Quest
_Wurt_ with **"The King's Crown Quest"** skill can give to **Merm King** a **Thulecite Crown**. If there is Merm King with Thulecite Crown, all loyal **Merm**s will learn to dodge. They will dodge in fighting with 10s cooldown. **Wurt** will also lose 5% less sanity from monsters.

### The King's Trident Quest
_Wurt_ with **"The King's Trident Quest"** skill can give a **Strident Trident** to the Merm King. If there is Merm King with a Strident Trident, all loyal merms, as well as **Wurt**, will deal 5% more damage. All tamed **Loyal Merm Guard**s also have 33% to use a triple attack. (Each strike deals 26.3 damage.)

### Lunar Mutated Merm
_Wurt_ with **"Lunar Mutated Merm"** skill can give loyal Merms and Loyal Merm Guards a **Moon Shard** or **Infused Moon Shard**. After that, the Merm will transform to **Mutated Merm**, and Loyal Merm Guard will transform to **Mutated Merm Guard**. **Wurt** with this skill can use **Pure Brilliance**, so for all loyal mutated merms their damage will be replaced with planar damage. This buff will work only 4 minutes. All mutated merms with this buff will have glowing eyes.

### Shadow Resurrection Merm
After a **Merm** who is loyal to a **Wurt** with **"Shadow Resurrection Merm"**

- **Spawn Code:** "parrot_blue"
- **Icon:** ![Parrot (Hamlet)](Parrot (Hamlet).png)
- **Spoil:** 2 Days
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Tool:** Can be Trapped (Only Bird Trap)

### Quotes

**Wilson:** I find myself fresh out of crackers.  
**Willow:** What a fiery color of red you are.  
**Wolfgang:** Chatty bird!  
**Wendy:** Is it my ears, or does the creature chatter a lonesome monologue?  
**WX-78:** THIS BIRD WISHES TO CONVERSATE  
... (and more quotes for other characters)

### Hunting

Parrots can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one. They can be killed by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel.

### Usage

**Recipes:**
- **Parrot:**
  - Hand: Morsel or Crimson Feather
  - Fire: Cooked Morsel
- **Parrot (Hamlet):**
  - Hand: Morsel or Azure Feather
  - Fire: Cooked Morsel

### Tips

- When bait-trapping Birds for their Feathers, players should make sure to do so on Turf in which specific Birds will spawn, so that they get specific Feathers.
- If the player doesn't want any Feathers from the Birds, cooking them alive provides a guaranteed Cooked Morsel.
- If placed in a Hamlet interior, birds will flop around on the floor, upside down. They will not fly away and can be picked up again.

### Trivia

- Meat such as Morsels previously attracted Crows. However, Morsels can no longer be used as a bait in traps and will not attract Crows to their location.
- The red parrot appears to be based on the green-winged macaw.
- Woodie strongly dislikes birds. He says they are evil and should be punished.

# Sunken Forest

The Sunken Forest is a Biome found inside of Caves. The ground is mainly composed of Grass and Forest Turf, with the surrounding area usually covered in mud and fog. Saplings, Grass Tufts, Berry Bushes, and Evergreens can be found here. These plants thrive on the shaft of light which filters from Surface World, though it disappears when Night comes.

Mobs cannot naturally be found in this biome, though Gobblers can spawn by picking the Berry Bushes and Treeguards can spawn after chopping the Evergreens. Both Mobs will behave as they do in the Surface World.

### Abundant Flora
- Evergreen
- Grass Tuft
- Sapling
- Light Flower
- Fern
- Twiggy Tree (Don't Starve Together icon)

### Occasional Flora
- Rabbit Hutch 
- Carrot
- Berry Bush
- Mushrooms
- Spider Den
- Frog Pond
- Juicy Berry Bush (Don't Starve Together icon)

### Rare Fauna
- Tentapillar

# Ice Floe

**Don't Starve Together Exclusivity:**
![Ice Surface Texture](Ice Surface Texture.png)

**Perk:**
- Exists for some time before collapsing. After breaking, spawns ![Ice Boat](Ice Boat.png).
- Biome: [Ice Sheet](Ice%20Sheet)

The **Ice Floe** is a surface that constitutes the **Ice Sheet** island. The unique feature of this turf is that if you move too much, your character may slip and fall, which can be highly inconvenient during combat. The duration for which Ice Floes last before breaking depends on their location.

- If located on the **Ice Sheet** island, the surface will begin to slowly collapse after defeating **Frostjaw**, starting from the edges and ending in the middle.
- The Ice Floe will also grow on the island during **winter**, creating an island with dimensions of 11 turfs vertically/horizontally and 6 turfs diagonally.
- In **spring**, it will gradually collapse until only an area of 5 turfs vertically/horizontally and 3 turfs diagonally remain.
- If the surface was spawned by the **Crab King**, the moment the Ice Floe starts collapsing depends on the gems slotted into the **Crab King**.

# Endothermic Fire

The **Endothermic Fire** is a craftable **Light Tab** **Structure** introduced in the **Reign of Giants** DLC. It requires a **Science Machine** to prototype and costs 2 **Nitre** and 3 **Cut Grass** to craft.

## Fuel
- Can be fueled with the same items as a regular fire, in addition to Nitre.

## Quotes

- Willow: "I like fire of all kinds."
- Wolfgang: "Good bye dark times!"
- Wendy: "I might survive this night!"
- WX-78: "A TEMPORARY ENCAMPMENT"
- Wickerbottom: "A rather strange, magical fire pit."

# Endothermic Fire Pit

The **Endothermic Fire Pit** is the permanent version of the Endothermic Fire. It requires an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype and costs 2 **Nitre**, 4 **Cut Stone**, and 2 **Electrical Doodad**s to craft.

## Attributes
- **Discharge Rate**: Fuel lasts for 6 minutes (Multiply Fuel Value x2)
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Tool**: Can be Hammered
- **Tier**: 2
- **Perk**: Provides light and cools the player
- **Sanity Drain**: Up to +10/min (Willow only)
- **Spawn Code**: "coldfirepit"
- **Description**: More efficient, but still backwards.

## Fuel Efficiency
Each fuel item burns as long as they would in a **Fire Pit**, which is twice as long as the burn time in a Campfire or Endothermic Fire.

# Skins
- **Loyal Bone-Chilling Firepit**: Twitch Drops for watching 6 hours of "Don't Starve Together" on Twitch from October 24, 2019 to December 12, 2019.
- **Loyal Nouveau Frigid Firepit**: Twitch Drops for watching 3 hours of "Don't Starve Together" on Twitch from December 19, 2023 to January 11, 2023.

# Tips
- An **Ice Flingomatic** will attempt to put out an Endothermic Fire the same way it does with regular fires.
- Building an **Ice Box** to cool **Thermal Stone** may be cheaper and more effective than building an Endothermic Fire Pit, due to there being a lack of a maintenance cost. A Thermal Stone cooled using Ice Box is also cooled to a lower temperature compared to Endothermic Fire, allowing the Thermal Stone to remain cooler.

# Trivia
- In thermodynamics, the term "endothermic" describes a process that absorbs heat energy from its surroundings, "endo" meaning 'inner' as in "going into" thus "absorbing", while the term "exothermic" is the opposite, "exo" meaning "outer", as in "coming out of" thus "dispersing".
- The Endothermic Fire is blue, meant to represent a lack of heat, but in reality, blue flames are hotter than yellow flames.

# Plants in Don't Starve, its DLCs, and Don't Starve Together

This page lists the numerous **Plants** in *Don't Starve*, its **DLCs**, and *Don't Starve Together*. Each one has their own unique use. Most plants are native to one biome, but can be found elsewhere if their frequency is increased using custom World Settings.

| Plant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Evergreen] | **Evergreen**: Can be found nearly everywhere. Cut down with the **Axe**, which drops 1-3 **Logs** and 1-2 **Pine Cones** and leaves behind a stump that can be dug up with the **Shovel**, yielding one extra **Log**. Occasionally, nearby Trees may turn into **Treeguards** when a tree is chopped down. |
| ![Lumpy Evergreen] | **Lumpy Evergreen**: Lumpy Evergreens are a variant of the typical evergreen with lumpy and wilted-looking branches. Unlike normal Evergreens, the Lumpy variety does not produce **Pine Cones**, leading characters to wonder how it reproduces at all. They still have a life-cycle, growing to huge trees and then reverting to small ones. Also like normal trees, lumpy ones can become **Treeguards**. |
| ![Spiky Tree] | **Spiky Tree**: These trees are exclusively found in the **Marsh** Biome. These trees don't have a life-cycle. When cut down with an **Axe** it will drop a **Twig** and they have a 20% chance of dropping a log. The stump also yields a log like the others. The **Spiky Tree** and the **Cave Banana Tree** are the only **trees** that drop **Twigs**. |
| ![Totally Normal Tree] | **Totally Normal Tree**: The Totally Normal Tree is a tree found in the Forest Biome. It can be chopped down, to give the player 2 Living Logs. The player can then use a Shovel to dig up the stump to gain an additional Living Log. If burned, it will drop **Charcoal** when chopped just like other burned trees. These trees will have a randomized number of **Evil Flowers** growing near them. When cutting it down, it will make a groaning/moaning noise with every chop. |
| ![Sapling] | **Sapling**: Often found in Forest and Grasslands Biomes. Can be harvested by hand, which yields one **Twig**. Can be dug with a **Shovel** to replant. No fertilizing is required for growth after planting. |
| ![Berry Bush] | **Berry Bush**: Can be found in a number of Biomes, most notably Grasslands and Forest. Can be harvested by hand, which yields one **Berries**. Can be dug with a Shovel to collect a **Berry Bush** that the player may plant or use to make a **Bush Hat**. Fertilizing with **Manure** or **Rot** is required for growth after planting. After a few harvests, the Berry Bush will need to be re-fertilized to continue growth. |
| ![Grass Tuft] | **Grass**: Commonly found in Grasslands, Savanna, and rarely in Forest Biomes. Can be harvested by hand, which yields one **Cut Grass**. Can be dug with a Shovel to collect a **Grass Tuft** that the player may plant. Fertilizing with **Manure** or **Rot** is required for growth after planting. |
| ![Reeds] | **Reeds**: Exclusively found in the **Marsh** biome. Can be harvested by hand, which yields one **Cut Reeds**. Reeds cannot be dug up with a **Shovel** and replanted. |
| ![Spiky Bush] | **Spiky Bush**: Exclusively found in the **Marsh** Biome, (and the **Desert** but only in the **Reign of Giants** DLC). It can be harvested by hand, which yields one **Twig**, but also causes 3 damage. This can be avoided by digging it up with a **Shovel** and replanting it. Spiky bushes are really useful in Adventure Mode levels **Archipelago** and **The King of Winter**, because they grow back even during winter. |
| ![Plant] | **Plant**: Spawns next to **Pond**s in the surface. It has no use other than burn it to obtain **Ashes**. |
| ![Algae] | **Algae**: Its purpose is similar to a Plant but it can only be found on ponds which are located in the Ruins. |
| ![Flower] | **Flower**: Found in a

Each [[Spring]] (except on Spring or Winter starts, unless the player restarts the game after day 27 in Spring), 50% (or 0%, 25%, 75%, 100% of them for other world configuration options, respectively) of these will be occupied after 0.5-1.5 days, rounding up. The [[Moose/Goose Egg/DST|Moose/Goose Egg]]s will be laid 0.25-0.5 days after arrival, and hatch 5 [[Mosling/DST|Mosling]]s after 2 days or being hammered.

Once the Moslings are hatched, the Moose/Goose will fly away and they will wander around their nest and eat Food they found. If they got attacked, they will go back to their nest and call for their mother. After a few seconds, a Moose/Goose will spawn. After killing the Moose/Goose, all Moslings will become enraged and use a whirlwind attack that attracts [[Lightning]] to them, attempting to strike the player.

Moose/Goose will not destroy player-built structures, except for [[Walls]].

## Strategy
Moose/Goose will make a warning animation once it spots the player, becoming aggressive towards them. She will proceed to slowly hop towards the player. When in range, she will attempt to gore the player. After every third swipe, she will honk which is a disarming attack, knocking the player's weapon out of their hands. The attack can be avoided by unequipping the held item and re-equipping it. Due to her slow movement, and slightly slow attack, she can be fought the same way as Deerclops, using a 3-hit kite method. Another option is to tank all the damage with a [[Football Helmet]] and [[Log Suit]], eliminating the need to kite.

Alternatively, since Moose/Goose lacks an area-of-effect attack, it can be lured into a herd of [[Beefalo]]s, as Beefalos are always in heat during spring. Since it can only strike one at a time, losses to a large herd will be minimal. The player can also use friendly [[Pig/DST|Pigs]], but they will eat the meat after the giant is killed. The Moose can also be lured into an area with multiple [[Pond]]s so the Frogs will attack her at day time. However, at dusk, the Frogs will go back to their Ponds until next day, making this strategy not viable during dusk and night.

Another strategy is to build a large circle with a gap for an entrance of trees and lure Moose/Goose inside the trees. She will be trapped inside, allowing the player to kite her easier.

## Tips
- Players can put a [[Houndius Shootius]] on a [[Boat]] and anchor the boat offshore to kill the Moose/Goose without taking damage.
- It's possible to kill multiple Meese/Geese easily if the player is near them and a [[Frog Rain]] is occurring, and letting the [[Frog]]s to attack the [[Mosling/DST|Mosling]]s.
  - This way, they can get a large amount of [[Frog Legs]], [[Meat]], [[Drumstick]]s and [[Down Feather]]s with little to no effort.
- It's recommend to build a [[Lightning rod]] before fighting the Moose/Goose as Moslings can cause [[Lightning]] and burn the Down Feather

# Crustashines

Crustashines are passive **Mobs** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **The Curse of Moon Quay** update. They are found roaming on **Moon Quay** and spawn from the **Unnatural Portal**. They provide a small amount of light while in their mob state. Similar to **Rabbit**s, they will run away from the player when approached but can be caught with a **Trap**, resulting in it being added to the player's inventory. In this state, the Crustashine will die after five in-game days, but can be fed with any kind of **food**.

The Pitchfork is a [Tool] used for digging up [Turfs] in [Tile]-sized chunks. It requires 2 [Twig]s and 2 [Flint] to craft and a [Science Machine] to prototype.

### Usage
Once the Pitchfork is equipped, a square outline will appear on the ground showing the patch that the cursor is hovering over, along with a prompt. Right-clicking will dig up the outlined terrain, leaving a barren patch in its place. Turf items can only be placed on this sort of barren terrain.

The Pitchfork has 200 uses (800 for snazzy pitchfork), which means that each time it digs up a turf, it will lose 0.5% durability. It can also be used as a weapon which deals 17 damage but suffers higher durability loss per hit (4%).

In Don't Starve, a Turf's instant availability and decent [Fire#Fuel Values] fuel value, coupled with the Pitchfork's high durability and speed, makes Turfs one of the easiest options for fueling [Campfires] and [Fire Pits]. Turfs are not renewable, however. In Don't Starve Together, Turfs have a significantly lower burn time (7.5s instead of 45s), making it a weak method for fueling, although it can be used in the same way as [Pine Cone] Pine Cones in that the player will likely have an excess of them for no other purpose than fuel.

Dug up Turf can be replaced with other kinds of Turfs (e.g. [Wooden Flooring]). This is useful for decoration or for preventing [Meat Bulb (Lureplant)] Lureplants and [Eyeplant]s from spawning.

The digging animation for the Pitchfork can be cut short by moving after the player digs up anything. This speeds up the process of mass-clearing turf when holding spacebar.

### Skins
In Don't Starve Together, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the [Belongings] page.

## Description
A **Message in a Bottle** is a naturally spawning [Item] exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It can be found lying on [Beach]es or floating in the [Ocean](#), and appears as a regular bottle with a piece of paper inside. Once the message has been read, it will turn into an [Empty Bottle](#).

Upon reading the message, the player's [Map](#) will automatically open and a red X will be placed on it, possibly in an area the player has already explored. If the player travels to the location, they will find two bones laid out in the formation of an X in a pile of dirt which can be dug up with a [Shovel](#) to uncover a [Chest](#) and two [Bone Shards](#). This Chest usually contains valuables such as [Dubloons](#) and [Gems](#), but may also occasionally cause [Snake]s to appear.

Each Message in a Bottle corresponds to a single treasure location determined during world generation, making them a finite resource.

## Trivia
- If the player tries to spawn the Message in a Bottle using the [Console](#) and reads it, the character will say "This message is faded, I can't read it".
- If the player carries a Message in a Bottle and uses the [Teleportato](#) to teleport to a new world, once reading the bottle they'll say "This doesn't look like a map of this place".

# Weapons in Don't Starve Together

_Weapons_ are **Items** used to fight, hunt, and defend oneself from creatures in *Don't Starve Together*. Most weapons have a durability, limiting the number of times it can be used.

In the hostile wilderness, a player's bare hands won't stand up well to many of the hostile creatures found or be able to hunt very effectively, while running can get one safely out of harm's way at first, a player will need to start utilizing weapons for self-defense, hunting, and especially for the periodic **Hound** attacks, or other fast, persistent enemies.

Some characters have personal damage modifiers. **Wes** and **Wendy** deal normal damage × 0.75, **Wigfrid** deals normal damage × 1.25, **Wolfgang** deals normal damage × 0.50-2.00, and **Wanda** deals normal damage × 0.50-1.75 (depend on her age and weapon type). All characters' unarmed attacks deal 10 points of damage per hit, and can be executed only once every second while armed ones can be executed twice, making characters' unarmed attacks impractical for combat.

Any other item that equips to the hand slot, such as **Umbrella**, can be used to attack with the use of the Force Attack command/button, but will only do as much damage as an unarmed attack. Using items this way won't deplete the item's durability any more than holding it normally does.

## Melee Weapons

| Item | Name | Damage | Planar Damage | Uses | Crafting | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Alarming Clock] | **Alarming Clock** | 81.6(Nightmare Fuel) or 27.2 | 0 | 96 | Time Pieces×3 Marble×4 Nightmare Fuel×8 | It is a whip-like weapon that can only be used by Wanda. |

## Tools

_Tools_ can also be used as weapons and have varying amounts of damage and durability. Golden versions of each tool do the same damage and have 4 times the durability.

| Item | Name | Damage | Planar Damage | Uses | Crafting | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Moon Glass Axe] | **Moon Glass Axe** | 34 | 0 | 80 | Twigs×2 Moon Shard×3 |  |

The **Deflated Balloon** is a naturally spawning structure found in **Don't Starve: Hamlet**-compatible worlds. Only one spawns per world, and it can be **Hammer**ed to yield two **Cut Grass** and two **Rope**. It always spawns next to a **Wicker Basket** which has its own **Map** icon, allowing it to be easily found later.

## Trivia

- It shares its texture with a part of the **Crashed Balloon**, which is a similar structure that appears in the spawn area of a **Hamlet** world.

# Food

Food can be obtained by foraging, trapping, farming, or hunting mobs. It refills Hunger and may restore some Health along with Sanity, depending on the quality of the food eaten. Eating some foods, such as Monster Meat or Durians, can damage the player's health instead of restoring it. Some foods, such as raw Meat or Morsels, will damage a player's sanity if eaten. Mushrooms have varying effects on Health and Sanity depending on their color. Special food items, such as Glow Berry, have additional effects when eaten.

Almost all raw food can be cooked on a Campfire to increase the amount of Health/Hunger/Sanity restored or reduced, and sometimes remove Health/Sanity penalties from eating it. Some raw food items, most notably Meats, can be dried on a Drying Rack to produce long-lasting food items with increased Health/Hunger/Sanity values. Additionally, a Crock Pot can be used for making foods that have additional benefits.

Food items also have other uses than eating them directly. Meat can be used as bait for carnivores, for the recruitment of Pigs, and as an offering to the Pig King for Gold Nuggets. A renewable way to gain Eggs is by giving meats to birds housed in Bird Cages. Bunnymen can be befriended using Carrots and will become hostile if meat is in the player's inventory. Vegetables and Fruits can be used as bait for herbivores and given to Pigs to obtain Manure. Seeds can be used to bait Bird Traps.

Being of the most important items in the game, (and part of the game's namesake, to not starve) food is typically very valuable in any world; however, given the layouts of different maps and what spawns in them, food availability can vary from being abundant to dangerously short. Food is affected by the seasons, which likely encourages the player to take advantages of seasonal diets and also take advantages of the food's shelf life.

With the introduction of Overheating mechanic, some foods are classified as hot or cold, providing an alternative way to combat Freezing and Overheating, respectively.

When players eat Foods that count as Meats, they will have a chewing animation and are not able to perform other actions for a relatively long duration. When eating Foods that are not Meats, they will just put it into their mouth very fast.

## Categories

There are two ways to categorize Food:
- [Food Value for food value used in Crock Pot recipes](Food Value)
- [Food Type for what type of food is](Food Type)

## Perish Times

Most food and some non-edible items have a perish time, eventually turning into Rot, turning into another food or item, or disappearing completely.

| Stage   | Freshness | Effect                                                         |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fresh   | 50-100%   | Restores the full amount of Hunger, Health, and Sanity for a given food. |
| Stale   | 21-49%    | Restores 2/3 of Hunger, 1/3 of Health for a given food and doesn't restore any Sanity. |
| Spoiled | 1-20%     | Restores 1/2 of Hunger for a given food, doesn't restore any Health and decreases Sanity by 10. |

Spoiling time can be affected by various aspects:

| Container                    | Spoilage Rate (higher = spoils faster) | Notes |

# Deerclops

The Deerclops is a **boss monster** that is only active during Winter, unless edited in World Customization. It has a lot of health, does a lot of damage and can destroy Structures and trees. The Deerclops is aggressive towards anything it encounters and can kill most creatures easily. Its monstrous appearance drains Sanity quickly when the character gets too close.

## Behavior

The Deerclops spawns during Winter near the player. Its approach is signaled by a deep moaning sound, which the character will eventually comment on, similar to the way that Hounds are signaled. Unlike Hounds, the Deerclops will not follow the player wherever they go; the player can move away and, with skill, leave the Deerclops behind to despawn when Winter ends.

The first Deerclops will generally spawn on Day 30.8. If no player is on the surface world or mainland, its spawn is delayed until someone is, after which it will spawn in 60 seconds. Deerclops respawns from dying after 16.8 Winter days. Since the default winter length is 15 days, this is more than a season and will always be 71.8 days after the kill (or 126.8 if killed on the last 1.8 days of winter). If killed after winter, like in spring, it respawns after 2.8 winter days by default. Deerclops spawns at Day 30.8, 102.6, and 174.4 plus however long it took to kill it, by default. The number of Deerclops spawned per winter can be increased with world configuration, or with Hostile Flares.

## Hunting

The Deerclops can be kited, a process by which the player attacks, moves away to avoid an attack, then attacks again. It is possible to strike the Deerclops three times in between attacks, or four times if the player is walking over Cobblestones or Road, or can quickly equip a Walking Cane. It is highly recommended to stick to three or even two hits if one doesn't know the exact hitbox of the Deerclops. The player must time their attacks with the Deerclops's animations, as its long and wide ranged melee attack is hard to dodge. Its big health means this will take time, however, and the character's Sanity will drop very quickly. Armor should be worn when attempting this as the Deerclops can kill most characters in two strikes. Two or three Log Suits and Football Helmets should be enough to absorb damage, and around 10 pieces of Jerky should be enough to recover health and mitigate the sanity loss. A Walking Cane and timed clicking can increase the ability to dodge its attacks in between the player's blows, and gives a speed boost to run away if necessary. Deerclops' attacks will freeze the player after two hits, unless the player places a fire source next to them.

## World Customization

Deerclops attack frequencies may be adjusted in World Customization as follows:

| Option    | Number of Attacks per Season | Attacks During Summer? |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| None      | 0                            | No                    |
| Default   | 1                            | No                    |
| Less      | 1                            | No                    |
| More      | 2                            | No                    |
| Lots      | 3                            | Yes                   |

## Trivia

- The Deerclops was added in **A Winter's Tale** update. At the end of the update's trailer, the screen goes black for a brief amount of time. During this time, the growl of the Deerclops is heard.
- The name "Deerclops" is a portmanteau of "Deer" and "Cyclops".
- Pictures of the Deerclops appeared in the teaser video for the **Long Live the Queen** update, at around 30 and 45 seconds into the video (see pictures). It's clear that the image shown was an older/simplified design.

**Pearl's Pearl** is an item exclusive to [[Don't Starve Together]], introduced in [[Return of Them]]. It can be obtained from the [[Crabby Hermit]] by following her questline. Its main purpose is to be socketed into the [[Crab King]] for the boss fight. Socketing the pearl buffs the Crab King significantly, but it makes the King drop the [[Inactive Celestial Tribute]]. When the Crab King is defeated, Pearl's Pearl turns into a **Cracked Pearl**.

# Burrow

## Overview
The **Burrow** is a naturally occurring object from the **Reign of Giants** DLC that randomly spawns in **Grassland** Biomes. **Moleworms** will spawn at **Dusk** and **Night** from Burrows and start roaming around the area, looking for minerals and other ground-based items to store inside the Burrows.

## Details

- **Image**: ![Burrow](Burrow_(DST).png)
- **Spawns**: Moleworms
- **Biome**: Grassland
- **Spawn Code**: "molehill"
- **Renewal**: Yes
- **Tool**: Can be Dug with a Shovel
- **Resources**: Rocks (53.3%), Flint (20%), Nitre (20%), Gold Nugget (6.6%), Anything taken by Moleworms

## Quotes
- Wilson: "What a nice, homey hole in the ground!"
- Willow: "It burrows away from the sun's skyfire. Unnatural."
- Wolfgang: "Mole hole."
- Wendy: "Down, down, down to the depths."
- WX-78: "HOME OF A SMALL DIGGER"
- Wickerbottom: "The tunnel system must be vast!"
- Woodie: "I bet it's just a pile of rocks inside."
- Maxwell: "Burrow deep, I'm coming for you."
- Wagstaff: "The home of a subterranean creature."
- Wigfrid: "Sömething fiendish lives döwn there."
- Webber: "Hidey-hole."
- Walani: "Nice hole, mole."
- Warly: "It is a nice hill, but I won't make a mountain of it."
- Woodlegs: "E's 'avin' a sleep in th'dirt."
- Wilba: "'TIS A PLACE OF THWACK RAT"
- Wormwood: "You okay, dirt?"
- Wheeler: "Where are you hiding?"
- Winona: "The excavation crew's down there."
- Wortox: "Peering inside it makes my brow furrow."
- Wurt: "Mole home."
- Walter: "I wonder what's in there..."
- Wanda: "I thought they were bigger... my memory must've exaggerated it."

## Game Mechanics
Burrows can be dug up with a **Shovel** to randomly yield **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Nitre**, and **Gold Nugget**s. When dug, Burrows will also drop any item stolen by Moleworms. Burrows can store up to 50 inventory slots; any extra items that moleworm attempt to store, but cannot do so due to filled inventory, will pop out.

If a Burrow is dug up, the Moleworm that inhabited it will make a new one after some time. This makes Burrows renewable as long as the Moleworm is not also killed. If a Moleworm is killed, the Burrow will spawn a new Moleworm after 2.5 **Days**, in the same way **Rabbit Holes** spawn **Rabbits**. However, it is worth noting that even if all of the Moleworms and Burrows in a world are killed or destroyed, respectively, they are still renewable through both **Catcoons**, **Tumbleweeds**, and **Earthquakes**. Because Burrows drop minerals and Moleworms can create new Burrows, this makes **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Nitre**, and **Gold** renewable.

## Hunting

Cave Spiders differ from other Spiders because of their shell-armor. After two hits, they will close up the shell which gain 75% Damage Reduction. After a few seconds, they will open their shell and begin to attack again, at which point they are vulnerable. These Spiders can be stunlocked while they are out of the shell and will stay inside as long as they are being attacked, which means they are relatively easy to kill with patience.

### Weapon Hits to Kill

| Weapon | No. of Hits |
|--------|------------|
| Fishing Rod/Bug Net | 36 |
| Lucy the Axe | 12 |
| Shovel/Pitchfork | 9 |
| Hammer/Torch/Umbrella | 6 |
| Walking Cane/Willow's Lighter | 5 |

## Shadow Rift Content

If caught in Acid Rain, its damage attack will rise to +50%, move speed will rise to +15%, and taking damage decreases by -25%. The fact that it is subject to the effect can be understood by the special breath that it will emit.

## Tips

- Be aware that Spilagmites will also spawn Spitters. Spilagmites can be mined to keep the spiders from respawning.
- Wolfgang can easily kill Cave Spiders with 3 hits from a Spear or 2 hits from a Tentacle Spike or Dark Sword. Dealing with Cave Spiders (as well as many other enemies) as a Werebeaver means one bite does the same damage as a hit from a Tentacle Spike.
- It is recommended that players equip a Miner Hat while fighting these creatures. It allows the player to see other mobs that might be attacking. Alternatively, dropping one or more Lanterns in the area you're

## Scrapbook Info
Summons Hutch when picked up. Hutch will follow the holder. While Hutch is alive, Star-Sky will be alive.

Star-Sky is an Item found exclusively in the Caves of Don't Starve Together once per world. Most commonly found in the Wilds on Mud Turf next to Rocky Turf. Its spawn is commonly associated with the Ponds of Toadstool, slurtles, and light flowers. Upon picking it up, Hutch will spawn and follow this Item, similar to how Chester and Packim Baggims follow the Eye Bone and Fishbone, respectively.

As long as Webber is the one carrying Star-Sky, spiders will not attack Hutch. This does not apply to the Spider Queen, or the spiders spawned by her.

If Wurt holds Star-Sky, she will receive a small sanity boost similar to holding a Freshwater Fish.

## Trivia
- Hutch and Star-Sky's names are references to the TV series Starsky and Hutch.
- Wickerbottom's quote, "Pygocentrus nattereri", is the scientific name for a Red-Bellied Piranha.
- WX-78's quote for star-sky when hutch is dead (ONE FISH, TWO FISH, RED FISH, DEAD FISH,) is a reference to the Dr. Seuss book: One fish, Two fish, Red fish, Blue fish.

Exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, Bunny Stew is a Crock Pot recipe introduced in the **An Eye for An Eye** update. It requires 2 **Ice** and **Meats** with a total value less than 1. Using 1 full meat value or higher will result in **Meatballs**. Using less than two ice will also yield Meatballs.

## Structure Infobox
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: This one's luck has run out.
- **Willow**: It warms from the inside out.
- **Wolfgang**: Tiny rabbit makes big food? Wolfgang likes math.
- **Wendy**: You were fast, little rabbit, but death is faster.

- **Wurt**: Glorp... Bunny's bath was too hot...
- **Walter**: There's no Pioneer that could say no to this!
- **Wanda**: This rabbit was too late.
- **Choose**: Winona

## Recipe
- **Item 1**: Meats (< 1.0)
- **Item 2**: Ices (2)
- **Item 3**: Filler
- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Bunny Stew
- **Note**: Fillers cannot be **Inedibles**.

## Examples
1. **Morsel** + **Ice** + **Ice** + **Ice** = Bunny Stew
2. **Fish Morsel** + **Ice** + **Ice** + **Berries** = Bunny Stew
3. **Cooked Frog Legs** + **Cooked Barnacles** + **Ice** + **Ice** = Bunny Stew

## Tips
- Bunny Stew is an ideal dish for **Winter**, due to the scarcity of some foods and the abundance of ice in the form of Mini Glaciers. Because Bunny Stew heals the consumer and warms them up, it can be used to, paradoxically, save the player from Freezing to death.
- While, on paper, Bunny Stew appears to be a recipe intended to prevent players from creating Meatballs with only one Morsels and three Ice, it is nonetheless a useful recipe for very cheaply restoring Health if eggs and vegetables are not readily available for Pierogi.

## Trivia
- **Bunny Stew** is an item in **Terraria**.
- Wilson's quote ("This one's luck has run out.") is a reference to the tooltip in **Terraria**.

# Tragic Train Crash (August 15, 1904)

This tragic event was first mentioned in **William Carter's 4th puzzle** and depicted in more detail in the animated short **The Incredible Strongman**. The Abernethy & Parker circus was forced out of town after Wolfgang's act was revealed to be a fraud. Their caravan became stuck on a train track, and the staff prioritized saving a baby elephant, leading to a train collision with the cart. William Carter was trapped under a train car and used the **Codex Umbra** to grant Wolfgang the strength to lift the train car before escaping. Wolfgang's desire to reclaim that unnatural strength is hinted to be part of the bargain that led him to the Constant.

![Fourth Puzzle](William_Carter_Puzzle_4.jpg "Fourth Puzzle"){: .thumbnail .align-right width="300"}

On August 23, 1904, an article in The Daily Speaker reported that the circus cart stopped on the railroad due to an elephant, causing a train crash in the desert at Old Mill crossing. William Carter was presumed dead, and some circus monkeys escaped. According to William's ticket, the accident occurred on August 15, 1904.

**Newspaper Quote:**
```
TRAGIC TRAIN CRASH
Circus wagon struck at crossing
Many passenger injuries reported
Elephant unharmed
```

```
A passenger train struck a circus wagon that had broken down along the tracks at the Old Mill crossing. Dozens of passengers were injured, and at least one man is missing. The missing man has yet to be identified, but fellow passengers described him as a tall, nervous fellow with an English accent. A search party was convened but quickly abandoned when it became apparent that a cage full of potentially dangerous trained monkeys had been vacated in the collision. Given the remoteness of the crash site, the scorching desert sun, and the escaped animals, the missing man has been presumed dead.
```

```
This is the third such incident at the crossing since the railway's construction in 1873, but the first to involve a circus wagon. Local businessman and railway investor Harold J. Rutherford assured this publication that all pertinent safety precautions had been taken, but no one could have foreseen the appearance of such a dangerous blockage on the tracks.
```

# Earthquake in San Francisco (April 17, 1906)

After the final act of Maxwell and Charlie, they entered the Constant, and an earthquake began in San Francisco at 05:12:27. The earthquake is a real historical event and is also mentioned in **The Curtain Calls**, where Wigfrid disappeared shortly after the earthquake.

# The Exposition Universelle Brussels (1910)

Information about this event first appeared in a short film about Winona. Robert Wagstaff was present at the event, which was a real historical occurrence during which a fire gutted several pavilions in the Solbosch part of the exhibition. The fire destroyed parts of the Belgian and French sections, with the English section being the worst hit. After the fire, some destroyed parts were rebuilt quickly, and the event was successfully used for the promotion of the exhibition.

# New York State Capitol fire (March 29, 1911)

On March 29, 1911, a fire destroyed substantial portions of the New York State Capitol, including the New York State Library and the New York State Museum. The fire destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of documents and books. The event was depicted in the short **One For The Books**. At the time, Wickerbottom worked there and kept information from the Codex Umbra in a secret room. During the fire, Maxwell offered Wickerbottom a deal to keep all the important information, leading to her entry into the Constant.

# Voxola burns (1919)

After the production of the Voxola PR-76 radio, the factory burned down. The event was first depicted in the short **Next of Kin**, where Winona was present and found a doorway/portal similar to Maxwell's Door. Wagstaff was being drawn in, but when Winona tried to help him, he fell through the portal. She repaired the portal, and Charlie's shadow component took over, dragging Winona into the Constant as the building collapsed.
