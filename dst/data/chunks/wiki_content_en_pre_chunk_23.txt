## Description
Lune Trees are trees exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. They are found exclusively in the Lunar Forest and Lunar Baths Biome on the Lunar Island.

- Chopping a small Lune Tree gives 2 Logs and 50% to get a Lune Tree Blossom; the resulting stumps can be dug for one Log.
- Chopping a normal Lune Tree gives 3 Logs, 1 Lune Tree Blossom plus 25% to get an extra one, and spawn one Moon Moth; the resulting stumps can be dug for 2 Logs.
- Chopping a tall Lune Tree gives 4 Logs, 2 Lune Tree Blossom and spawn one Moon Moth plus 50% to spawn another; the resulting stumps can be dug for 2 Logs.

Moon Moths can be caught with a Bug Net and planted to make a Lune Tree Sapling.

## Tips
These can be a slightly better source for wood than Evergreens or Birchnut Trees as they give up to 6 Logs instead of 4.

## Trivia
- Lune Trees were introduced in the Turn of Tides update.
- Lune Trees are probably modeled after Adansonia Baobab or desert rose trees.
- The fact that, similar to Butterflies, Moon Moths are used to plant Lune Tree implies that they're oversized Flowers, rather than actual trees.

# Cave Holes
_Cave Holes_ are naturally spawning objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**.

## Description
Cave Holes appear in the **Ruins**. Each Cave Hole contains a treasure, but the items inside cannot be picked up directly. The Lazy Forager, Polly Roger's Hat, Wortox's teleport ability, and the Lazy Explorer are the only ways to pick them up. The Ruins can be regenerated by killing the Ancient Fuelweaver, allowing players to farm the Cave Holes for loot by defeating the boss repeatedly.

## Tips
- One can make The Lazy Forager in a repaired Ancient Pseudoscience Station, then collect the treasure in the Cave Holes. As The Lazy Forager is refuellable, one can potentially amass a fair amount of Thulecite and Rare Gems.
- Wortox can Soul Hop into the Cave Hole to obtain its loot then Soul Hop back out, if done quickly, this will only cost 1 Soul.
- Maxwell can spawn a Shadow Servant in the Cave Hole to pick up the item from it and give it to its owner.

## Treasures
| Item(s) | Chance | Quantity |
|---------|--------|----------|
| ![Thulecite](https://example.com/thulecite.png) | 29% | 1-3 |
| ![Thulecite Fragments](https://example.com/thulecite_fragments.png) | 29% | 5-8 |
| ![Yellow Gem](https://example.com/yellow_gem.png) | 12% | 1 |

# Old Bell

The Old Bell is a craftable item from the "Reign of Giants" DLC. It can be obtained by locating and mining a Glommer's Statue, which drops the Old Bell's Blueprint as loot, or by finding the blueprint from a Tumbleweed. To craft the Old Bell, combine Glommer's Wings and Glommer's Flower together. The Old Bell is renewable as the materials to craft it are available during each Full Moon (mining Glommer's Statue does not destroy it).

## Item Info

- **Image**: ![Old Bell](File:Old Bell.png)
- **Ingredients**:
  - **Glommer's Wings**: 1
  - **Glommer's Flower**: 1
- **Tab**: Magic
- **Durability**: 3 uses
- **Perk**: Summons a giant creature to smash things in its path.
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "bell"
- **Description**: This isn't just any bell.
- **Tier**: 7

## Quotes

- Wilson: Dingalingaling.
- Willow: Is it New Year's Eve? Are there FIREWORKS?!
- Wolfgang: Bell make dainty sound.
- Wendy: Ring in the dead.
- WX-78: BZZ BZZ BZZ
- Wickerbottom: Quiet! This is a library!
- Woodie: I'm amazed it makes such a crisp sound.
- Maxwell: More bell.
- Wagstaff: It oscillates at an unusual wavelength.
- Wigfrid: I prefer the ringing resonance of clashing blades.
- Webber: Exactly the right amount of bell.
- Walani: Summons the big stomper.
- Warly: Should I ring it?
- Woodlegs: Thar be dingin' 'n 'lingin'.
- Wilba: DING-DONG, BELL
- Wormwood: Ding! Dong!
- Wheeler: I could ring it. That'd be fun.
- Walter: What if we put it on your collar Woby?
- Wanda: What's the worst that could happen?
- Wortox: I believe it might bring forth delight.
- Wurt: Make nice sound.
- Winona: There's always a stampede when the quitting bell rings.

## Biiigfoot

When used, the Old Bell summons Biiigfoot to stomp anything in its path. The creature's enormous foot takes a few seconds to reach the player. The screen will shake and a shadow will appear where the foot is about to touchdown. Biiigfoot destroys anything it steps on, dealing 1000 damage. Keep in mind that the shockwave caused by it does not deal any damage. It will aim for where the player was standing when the bell was rung, and can easily kill an insufficiently-armored player who doesn't move out of the way in time. When Biiigfoot stomps, the impact causes sleeping mobs to awaken.

Biiigfoot doesn't deal damage to Shadow Creatures, the Pig King, Fireflies, and Worm Holes.

## Don't Starve Together

Unlike most Reign of Giants items, the Old Bell cannot be crafted in Don't Starve Together as its Blueprint does not drop from Glommer's Statue, despite all of its ingredients being available.

## Usage

The Old Bell can be used to deal a significant amount of damage to high health mobs, making it the perfect item to deal with the likes of the Deerclops, Moose/Goose, Dragonfly, and Bearger, among others. In addition to being used as a weapon, the Old Bell can be an effective alternate to chopping Trees with an Axe or using allied Pigs as it doesn't require Gold or Flint and takes less time. Planting Pine Cones in an area as close as possible to each other should enable Biiigfoot to chop over 80 trees at once with a single step.

The Old Bell can be used to kill a herd of Beefalo at night. They will wake up as soon as they hear Biiigfoot approaching, but will not have enough time to move away.

Old Bells will cause Earthquakes when used in caves instead of summoning Biiigfoot.

A great combination to kill bosses is to first freeze them with an Ice Staff, then use the Old Bell next to them. This deals 1000 damage while the victim is immobilized.

Note that the shaking ground causes sleeping monsters to wake up and often move out of the way of Biiigfoot, thus avoiding the damage entirely.

## Tips

- When a Moleworm or Krampus steals an Old Bell, the bell will activate, consuming one of its uses and summoning Biiigfoot.
- Due to his curse, Woodie can only receive the Old Bell through inconvenient means. The only renewable method

# Nitre Formation

## Overview
The Nitre Formation is an object in **Don't Starve Together** that forms in Blue **Ponds** (characterized by their color, Algae and Eels) in the **Caves** as a result of **Acid Rain**. This process solidifies the pond and causes the player to not be able to use a **Fishing Rod** on it until the formation is destroyed. If mined, the Nitre Formation drops 3-4 **Nitre**. They will regrow as long as acid rain is falling.

## Tool
Can be **Mined** using a **Pickaxe**

## Resources
- Nitre

## Renewal
Yes, they will regrow as long as acid rain is falling.

## Spawn Code
"nitre_formation"

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It's definitely some kind of rock."
- Willow: "I don't know how anything could grow in that weird rain."
- Wolfgang: "It grew from burny rain?"
- Wendy: "It thrives while the rest of us burn."
- Wx78: "IT GREW, BUT NOT IN A GROSS ORGANIC WAY"
- Wickerbottom: "The acidic rain seems to have caused a chemical reaction, producing these formations."
- Woodie: "Guess that rain wasn't all bad, eh?"
- Maxwell: "A large growth of nitre."
- Wigfrid: "A böön fröm the burning rain."
- Webber: "It's a big stack of rock stuff!"
- Warly: "Adding a dash of acid to the mix created these formations."
- Wormwood: "Bunch of Pow Rocks"
- Winona: "Oh, I've got big plans for that!"
- Wurt: "Big bunch of funny rocks."
- Wortox: "After a while it formed a pile."

## Trivia
- Nitre Formations were added in the **From Beyond#Terrors Below** update.
- Although it can be spawned via **Console Commands**, it can't be mined or destroyed, purposing only a decorative effect as only the graphic is spawned. Also, spawning it on a pond won't connect the formation to it, even if they are already Nitre Formations.

## Skill Tree

### Portability

With [[Portability]] skill, Winona can craft Winona's G.E.M.erator in item form. She can then deploy or dismantle it.

### Energy-Saver

With [[Energy-Saver]] skill, placed G.E.M.erator will no longer consume energy while structures connect to it are not in use.

### Greater Generator I

[[Greater Generator I|Greater Generator]] skill increase the efficiency of the G.E.M.erator by 25% (Level I), 50% (Level II) or 100% (Level III). 

### Enlightened G.E.M.erator

With [[Enlightened G.E.M.erator]] skill, Winona can use [[Enlightened Shard]] to charge Winona's G.E.M.erator. Winona's G.E.M.erator with Enlightened Shard will not discharge (the G.E.M.erator gains infinite energy), instead the G.E.M.erator may overload if it runs out of charge too quickly. The more Enlightened Shard it contains, the more G.E.M.erator can withstand. If the G.E.M.erator is overloaded, it goes into a cooldown to 10 seconds and will start working again by turning on all gadgets.

### Brilliance G.E.M.erator

With [[Brilliance G.E.M.erator]] skill, Winona can use [[Pure Brilliance]] to charge Winona's G.E.M.erator. Catapults charged by Pure Brilliance will deal 30 physical damage and 17 planar damage. Also it will deal +10% damage to [[Shadow Aligned]] creatures.

## Skins

- ![Genteel G.E.M.erator](Genteel G.E.M.erator Icon.png) **Genteel G.E.M.erator**: "Behold, the power of beauty!"
- ![Jagged G.E.M.erator](Jagged G.E.M.erator Icon.png) **Jagged G.E.M.erator**: "A brutish display of power."

## Tips

- Since a G.E.M.erator will last 6 days total if fully fueled, each stored gem will provide up to 2 days of fuel if only one structure is powered by it.
- Considering the ease of obtaining [[Red Gem]]s and [[Blue Gem]]s compared to other colors, they should always be prioritize

## Quotes

- Wolfgang: Ugly house!
- Wilson: Doesn't smell very good.
- Willow: Fish mongers.
- Woodie: I'd prefer a log cabin.
- Maxwell: I suppose everyone needs to live somewhere...
- Wagstaff: The domicile of a marshy humanoid obsessed with fishing.

- Wheeler: What a... colorful smell.
- Choose: willow

## Description

Fishermerm's Huts are naturally spawning [[Structure]]s in [[Marsh]] [[Biomes]] in the ''[[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]]'' DLC. They spawn and shelter [[Fishermerm]]s, and up to 2 Fishermerms can inhabit 1 hut. Fishermerms are active during [[Dusk]] and [[Night]]. If a Fishermerm living in a hut dies, a new one will spawn after 4 [[day]]s from the hut. If hammered, the hut will drop 1 bundle of [[Boards]], 1 pile [[Rocks]], and 1 [[Tropical Fish]].

## Tips

- [[Merm]]s do not live in or spawn from Fishermerm's Huts. Fishermerms are passive and helpful as they will fish from the [[Tidal Pool]]s, and leave their catch on the ground. Therefore, it is beneficial to keep Fishermerm's Huts around instead of destroying them, if they are close to Tidal Pools. However, hostile creatures will attack Fishermerms, so the player should neutralize threats around the hut. This approach can provide the player with an endless supply of Tropical Fish with minimal effort.

# Raft (Don't Starve: Shipwrecked)
The **Raft** is a craftable **Boat** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is crafted from 4 **Bamboo** and 3 **Vines**, and can be found in the **Nautical Tab** at the start of the game. It has a durability of 150, which will deplete over time or if damaged and can be repaired with the **Boat Repair Kit** or **Sea Yard**. The Raft cannot have attachments.

## Quotes
- Wolfgang: "How will tiny plank support Wolfgang?"
- Wilson: "This looks adequate."
- Willow: "It would be unwise to light this on fire while at sea."
- Woody: "Pitiful little boat."
- Maxwell: "Much too precarious for my liking."
- Wagstaff: "A moderately manufactured buoyant craft."
- Wendy: "Perhaps if I ride upon the waves I shall join my sister."
- Woodlegs: "This vessel be an embarrassment!"
- Wickerbottom: "Bamboo how-to."
- Webber: "Do we think this is sturdy enough?"
- Warly: "Better than swimming, I suppose."
- WX-78: "I REALLY DO NOT WANT TO FALL INTO THE GLORIFIED SALT PUDDLE"
- Walani: "Worst. Surfboard. Ever."
- Wigfrid: "A Viking fears nöt dampness!"
- Wilba: "IT HATH THE SWIFTNESS"
- Wormwood: "Greenstick ship"
- Wheeler: "Would probably work just as well as an aeroplane."
- Choose: "WX-78"

## Tips
Occasionally, abandoned Rafts can be found floating in Shallow Ocean biomes, accompanied by 1 **Spear Gun**.

The **Log Raft** and the Raft share the same amount of durability; the only difference is that the Raft is faster. Like the Log Raft, the Raft is useless for Walani because her **Surfboard** only has 50 less durability, but it has 1.5 more speed.

This Shadow Tentacle will not hit players and Merms loyal to them.

Unlike the common Marsh Turf, the Corrupted Marsh Turf can't be dug up, can't be used for planting, using the Garden Digamajig, or building Wurt structures.

### Slippery Hide II
Wurt with the "Slippery Hide II" skill will also get wetness standing on Corrupted Marsh Turf.

# Ancient Murals

## Overview
**Ancient Murals** are objects in **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. They are located in the **Atrium** Biome, appearing in larger quantities near the **Ancient Gateway**. Their sole purpose is to be inspected for a set of 5 different quotes for each character, revealing part of the history of the **Ancient Civilization**.

Upon reading a mural, the character will say their first quote. Reading the same mural will always give the same quote. To get the second one, the player must find another Mural, and so on. After getting the 5th inspection, the next one will cycle back to the first.

## Murals

### 1st Mural
**Quotes:**
- **Wilson:** "It depicts an old civilization. The people look hungry and scared."
- **Willow:** "It's got a picture of some gross looking people."
- **Wolfgang:** "Is picture of many sad, weak people."
- **Wendy:** "A people struck by famine and sorrow."
- **WX-78:** "IT DEPICTS INFERIOR CREATURES"

- **Winona:** "There's a picture on it of some strangely shaped people."
- **Warly:** "A picture of lots of unprepared seafood. I'm hungry."
- **Wortox:** "A bunch of mortals. They look very bored."
- **Wormwood:** "Story!"
- **Wurt:** "Ooooh, picture story!"
- **Walter:** "It looks like things weren't going so well for the people here."
- **Wanda:** "A mural of an ancient civilization, but something is wrong..."

Depicts an old and underdeveloped civilization, composed of insect (or likely arthropod) people. They live in misery, suffering from hunger and fear. This is before they discovered **Nightmare Fuel**.

### 2nd Mural
**Quotes:**
- **Wilson:** "This tablet is too worn to make out."
- **Willow:** "Can't tell what that was a picture of."
- **Wolfgang:** "Cannot tell what was picture of."
- **Wendy:** "A piece of their story, lost to time."
- **WX-78:** "TARGET DATA LOST"
- **Wickerbottom:** "This mural panel is too eroded to decipher."
- **Woodie:** "Nothin' of interest left here."
- **Maxwell:** "We all know what happens next."
- **Wigfrid:** "There is nö painting here. Önly stöne."
- **Webber:** "This picture's all messed up."
- **Winona:** "Can't make heads or tails of this picture."
- **Warly:** "This tablet's all worn down."
- **Wortox:** "There's some magic residue on the stone. Not much else."
- **Wormwood:** "Can't read it"
- **Wurt:** "Can't see pictures, florp."
- **Walter:** "I can't tell what's happening in this one, the picture's worn off."
- **Wanda:** "Whatever was here has been lost to time."

Something mysterious happens to said civilization. No character is able to decipher what is depicted, though Maxwell knows what happened.

### 3rd Mural
**Quotes:**
- **Wilson:** "Something dark creeps over the city and its people."
- **Willow:** "I think someone spilled ink on this picture."
- **Wolfgang:** "In picture darkness covers sad, weak people."
- **Wendy:** "They are consumed by darkness."
- **WX-78:** "THE CREATURES ARE SUBMERGED IN BEAUTIFUL OIL"
- **Wickerbottom:** "A dark shadow, or perhaps a substance, overtakes the civilization."
- **Woodie:** "Black muck is covering everything in this drawing."
- **Maxwell:** "They gained such an enviable power..."
- **Wigfrid:** "A great evil sweeps acröss the land."
- **Webber:**

## Scrapbook Info
Packed so tight with wriggling friends that the explosive release of bugs inflicts damage to targets nearby.

Skeeter Bomb is a character-specific item craftable only by [[Wurt]] with the "[[Itchcraft I]]" skill. Skeeter Bombs can be thrown, similar to [[Water Balloon]]s, to deal 20 damage and spawn 4 [[Mosquito]]s. [[Mosquito]]s spawned from Skeeter Bombs are passive to players and passive to player mobs. They will attack mobs that are hostile or neutral to the player who threw the Skeeter Bomb. The [[Mosquito]]s will also follow the player who threw the bomb.

### Itchcraft II
Skeeter Bombs thrown by Wurts with the "[[Itchcraft II]]" skill will spawn 6 [[Mosquito]]s instead of 4.

# Magma

### Exclusivity
Don't Starve Together

### Object Infobox
- **Image**: ![Magma](File:Magma.png)
- **Biome**: [Desert](#)
- **Spawns**: [Lavae](#) (File:Lavae.png|50px|link=Lavae)
- **Spawn Code**: "lava_pond"

- **Walter**: "Probably not the best swimming hole."
- **Wanda**: "Not for swimming."

### Description
Magma is an environmental feature found in the **Desert** biome and exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. These pools are a part of a **Set Piece** found in the Desert, which serves as a spawn point for the **Dragonfly**. They are used by the Dragonfly to spawn **Lavae**.

Magma is often surrounded by small rocks, much like **Ponds** are surrounded by Plants or Algae. The Set Piece also has burnt **Spiky Trees** and **Spiky Bushes**, **Crispy Skeletons** that cannot be destroyed for resources, and numerous scorch marks on the ground.

Standing too close to Magma will cause the player, mobs, and most items to catch **Fire**. However, it should be noted that there is a slightly larger radius in which the player will take fire damage but will not be set on fire.

Magma also glows in the dark, but the pool's light radius is too small to be useful, as it doesn't reach past the "burn zone". Its heat radius is much larger than its light radius, so a player staying near one during **Winter** can avoid **Freezing**. This heat radius can warm thermal stones, which can provide light outside the "burn zone" and allow a player to survive the **night** with no other light sources.

It is possible to **Overheat** from standing near a magma pool even during the winter, which can be very useful to allow for more time away from a heat source. Magma can be used to **Cook food**, but the player will always catch fire in doing so. The only way to prevent this is to wear **Scalemail** or to play as **Willow**.

# Drying Rack

The Drying Rack is a craftable structure found in the Cooking Filter or Structures Filter. It requires 3 Twigs, 2 Charcoal, and 3 Rope to craft and a Science Machine to prototype.

## Structure Info
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Ingredients**:
  - Twigs: 3
  - Charcoal: 2
  - Rope: 3
- **Icon**: ![Drying Rack](Drying Rack.png)
- **Tier**: 1
- **Perk**: Dry Food items.
- **Spawn Code**: "meatrack"
- **Image**: ![Drying Rack Build](Drying Rack Build.png)
- **Description**: The jerkiest of racks.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "I should dry some meats."
- Willow: "I want to hang some meat!"
- Wolfgang: "I can dry meat!"
- Wendy: "I can hang meat here."
- WX-78: "I SHOULD HANG EXPIRED MEATSACKS HERE"
- Wickerbottom: "Meats can be dehydrated."
- Woodie: "It's set up... just add meat."
- Maxwell: "It can dry meats so that they last longer."
- Wagstaff: "Not the most sophisticated tool but it will do."
- Wigfrid: "Ah! A dangly rack för my meats"
- Webber: "It's not doing us much good empty!"
- Walani: "This rack could use some meat."
- Warly: "Just like the chefs of the stone age!"
- Woodlegs: "Hangin' spot fer me meats."
- Wilba: 'TIS FOR THE DRYING OF YON MEATS
- Wormwood: "Takes out wet"
- Wheeler: "Dried food is all I ever eat on long balloon trips."
- Winona: "A rack for drying meat."
- Wortox: "I don't have much use for this."
- Wurt: "Scale-less use this for making yucky foods."
- Walter: "We should make some jerky!"
- Wanda: "A horribly time consuming way to make meat last longer."

## Scrapbook Info
Certain items can be put on the rack and begin drying. After drying for some time, the item will turn into a dried version of itself.

## Details
The Drying Rack can dry most Meats and most Fish into Jerky, Small Jerky, or Monster Jerky. Kelp Fronds can be dried on the Drying Rack to obtain Dried Kelp Fronds. Dried food items take significantly longer to spoil and often provide better Health and Sanity compared to raw food used in the rack or their cooked versions.

Unlike the results of Cooking, the dried food created will always be completely fresh. This means a spoiled Morsel can be dried to get a completely fresh piece of Small Jerky. Dried food left on the Drying Rack will spoil over time. Rain will prevent any items on the Drying Rack from drying, making it less effective in Spring.

| Meat | Dried | Time Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Meat] | rowspan=2|![Jerky] || 2 days |
| ![Raw Fish] || 1 day |
| ![Monster Meat] || ![Monster Jerky] || 1 day |
| ![Batilisk Wing] | rowspan=2|![Small Jerky] || 2 days |
| ![Morsel] ![Frog Legs] ![Drumstick] ![Eel] ![Fish Morsel] || 1 day |
| ![Kelp Fronds] || ![Dried Kelp Fronds] || 0.25 days |

## Hermit Drying Rack
The Hermit Drying Rack is a naturally spawning object exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. Six of them can be found on the Hermit Island.

The Hermit Drying Rack works just like a drying rack, except that it cannot be destroyed or burned.

## Skins
* Woven - Elegant Butcher's Rack skin was introduced during the official Year of the Carrat event in 2020.
* Woven - Elegant Victorian Meat Rack skin was introduced during the official Year of the Beefalo event in 2021.

## Tips
* Drying Racks are very useful for storing Meats. Jerky and Small Jerky take 20 days to completely spoil, while Meat and Morsel will spoil in 6 days, and cooked Meat/Morsel will spoil in 10 days. Storing any kind of jerky in the Ice Box will give 40 days before they spoil, allowing the player to focus on concerns other than gathering fresh food.
* It is a good idea to build some racks early

- **Crafting Requirements**: 1 [[Straw Hat/DST|Straw Hat]], 1 [[Gold Nugget/DST|Gold Nugget]], and 1 [[Fireflies/DST|Fireflies]], an [[Alchemy Engine/DST|Alchemy Engine]] to prototype.
- **Durability**: 468 seconds (7.8 minutes), or almost 1 full day.
- **Wetness Reduction**: 20%

The Miner Hat doesn't break at 0% durability, and it can be refueled with [[Fireflies/DST|Fireflies]], [[Slurtle Slime/DST|Slurtle Slime]], or [[Light Bulb/DST|Light Bulb]]s. Fireflies add 180 seconds of durability (38.5%), Light Bulbs add 90 seconds (19.2%), and Slurtle Slime adds 45 seconds (9.6%). Unlike the [[Lantern/DST|Lantern]], a Miner Hat's brightness doesn't decrease as its durability declines.

## Skins

- **Cowboy Headlamp**: Miner Hat made from Cowboy Straw Hat.
- **Bonny Headlamp**: Nothing improves a design like adding more ruffles.
- **Frilly Headlamp**: Miner Hat made from Floppy Straw Hat.

## Tips

- It is recommended to refuel a Miner Hat with Light Bulbs instead of Fireflies, as only the Fireflies found in the [[Oasis]] and under [[Great Tree Trunk|Great Tree Trunks]] are renewable.

## Trivia

- Maxwell's quote for the Miner Hat implies that there are live fireflies inside the hat. Wagstaff's quote also supports this.

The **Mighty Gym** is a **Structure** in **Don't Starve Together** exclusive to **Wolfgang**. It can be crafted from his **Survivor Items Filter** and requires 4 **Boards**, 2 **Cut Stone**, and 3 **Rope** to craft, and a **Science Machine** to prototype. Its function is to increase Wolfgang's mightiness.

When the player enters the gym to start training, a minigame begins. A “bell” on the meter at the base of the structure starts moving, and the player must click when the bell is at the center of the meter to increase their mightiness. If the player clicks when the bell is at the borders (black), the weights will fall, and Wolfgang won’t gain any might. Additionally, the player’s rate of **Hunger** loss increases significantly during the minigame, especially when using heavier weights.

## Gym Weights

When built, the Mighty Gym's weights appear with **Potato Sacks** that can be unloaded and replaced for heavy items. Check the values below:

| Value | Item |

The **Sharkitten Den** is a naturally occurring **Structure** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, that spawns at most 4 **Sharkitten**s in the same time every 5 days during **Monsoon Season**. It cannot be destroyed and appears as a large **Sandy Pile** any other time of the year.

If a **Sharkitten** is attacked while near the Den, it will retreat to it. **Sharkittens** also retreat to the Den at dusk. In addition, if the **Tiger Shark** is alive, it will fall from the sky and appear to defend its kittens. The **Tiger Shark** will be hostile towards anything getting close to the Den.

## Pic32|Mosquito Bugs==
- **Sharkittens** may continue to spawn from the Den even if Monsoon Season has already ended. **Verify**|Found this to be true, on the last day of Dry season (I have it set to less, but still 10 days after Monsoon), I found 4 kittens, and the boss. Visibly saw them come in and out, although the den appeared to be collapsed.
  - (different person) They can also spawn in Hurricane season (first day). The den appears to be collapsed but you can still summon **Tiger Shark** by attacking the kittens

# Volcano Altar of Snackrifice

![Volcano Altar](Volcano Altar.png){ width=270 }

The Volcano Altar of Snackrifice is a naturally occurring structure found within the Volcano. It is active during the Dry Season, with the offering bowl shown as full of what appears to be lava. It accepts a variety of items as offerings, some of which provide "appeasement", while others provide "wrath". Items that anger it will deal 6 fire damage to the player on being offered. After being appeased by 66 segments (a little over 4 days of delay), it will stop accepting offerings.

The Altar is dormant all other seasons, only giving off a faint light, enough to keep Charlie away during the night.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "The altar is open and ready to accept offerings!"
- Willow: "Why would I wanna appease the volcano? Then it wouldn't shoot fire!"
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang is afraid to use."
- Wendy: "The will of the volcano flows through this shrine!"
- WX-78: "VOLCANO MODULATION DEVICE"
- Wickerbottom: "What shall I present it with?"
- Woodie: "I feel like it wants something from me."
- Maxwell: "Do I dare play with more forces beyond my control?"
- Wagstaff: "Such magnificent power! I must learn its secrets!"
- Wigfrid: "I must appease the fire god that lives inside this mountain."
- Webber: "We can feed the hungry volcano! But what does it like to eat?"
- Walani: "Ready to receive..."
- Warly: "It accepts offerings, I think."
- Woodlegs: "Ready fer bribin'."
- Wilba: "WHATFORE IT WANTS?"
- Wormwood: "Hot water!"
- Wheeler: "I get the same way when I'm hungry."

## Appeasement
Each item that can be offered has a different appeasement value. When offered, it adds its value in day segments (segments on the clock; there are 16 per day) to the time until the next eruption happens. Negative appeasement is wrath; these items will make the next eruption happen sooner.

| Item | Appeasement |
| --- | --- |
| One True Earring | 64 (4 Days) |
| Doydoy Feather, Mandrake, Shark Gills, etc. | 32 (2 Days) |
| Toucan, Seagull, Parrot, etc. | 16 (1 Days) |
| Blubber, Butterfly, Eel, etc. | 8 (0.5 Days) |
| Beard Hair, Bone Shards, Dubloons, etc. | 4 (0.25 Days) |
| Grass Suit, Log Suit, Straw Roll, etc. | -8 (-0.5 Days) |
| Coconade, Obsidian Coconade, Gunpowder, etc. | -16 (-1 Days) |

One should be warned that the pre-eruption warning tremors do not reset if the volcano is appeased below the level that triggered the warning.

## Tips
- Do not snackrifice Doydoys directly, and instead murder them in the volcano.
- If the player has a Birdcage, they can more effectively appease the volcano.
- The Altar could be used as a garbage disposal for unneeded or excess items.

## Trivia
- The One True Earring is a reference to The Lord of the Rings.
- Snackrifice is a combination of words "Snack" and "Sacrifice".

## Bugs
- Any eruption delays gained by appeasing the Altar within the Volcano may be forgotten outside of the Volcano.

- **Wheeler:** "Looks like it'd make a beautiful lunch."
- **Choose:** "Warly"

Tropical Fish is a type of Fish Food introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC.

## Obtaining Tropical Fish

- **Fishing:** In a Shoal or Tidal Pool with a Fishing Rod or rowing over it with Boats with an attached Trawl Net.
- **Fish Farms:** Stocked with Roe, they have a chance to continually produce Tropical Fish.
- **Merm and Fishermerm:** Drop Tropical Fish when killed.
- **Hammering:** Merm Huts and Fishermerm's Huts yield Tropical Fish, but these structures are not renewable and destroying them will also remove the source of Merm and Fishermerms respectively.
- **Fishermerms:** Fish in Tidal Pools on their own for Tropical Fish, but they will not eat what they catch, which then can be collected by the player.

## Usage

- **Crock Pot:** Counts as 0.5 units Meats and 1 unit of Fishes.
- **Cooking:** On a Fire will yield a Cooked Fish Morsel.
- **Drying Rack:** Dried to get Small Jerky.
- **Trading:** To Yaarctopus for Dubloons.

## Tips

- Tropical Fish has more meat and fish value than Cooked Fish Morsel obtained by cooking it on fire, so it is not recommended to cook Tropical Fishes if they are going to be used in the Crock Pot. Drying them also has a similar effect, but it may be more desirable since Small Jerky can be used in recipes that Tropical Fish cannot be, due to many Fish based recipes taking precedence over Meat based ones.
- Fish Farms stocking Tropical Fish are marked with a small sign showing a blue fish, after being harvested at least once.

## Trivia

- Tropical Fish resemble the real-life angelfish.
- Tropical Fish originally had its own cooked version.

## Scrapbook Info
The Wood Wall is the third strongest of the four Walls, a craftable Item, and Structure that prevents the player's and Mobs' movement. Once built, it can be repaired or upgraded to a second tier with another piece of Wood Wall or enough Twigs, Logs, or Boards. It can be attacked and destroyed, leaving a destroyed Wood Wall. It is also highly flammable, so measures should be taken when fighting Red Hounds, or during Summer. Using a Hammer on the wall will yield one Log from tier one and two Logs from tier three. It has a maximum of 200 health and begins with 100 health when first built before being upgraded.

## Recipe

# Crabbit Den

### Shipwrecked Exclusivity
![Rabbit Hole.png](Rabbit%20Hole.png)

### Object Information
- **Spawns**: [Crabbit](File:Crabbit.png), [Crab (insanity)](File:Crab%20(insanity).png)
- **Biome**: [Beach](Beach)
- **Spawn Code**: "crabhole"
- **Renew**: No
- **Tool**: [Shovel](File:Shovel.png)

### Quotes
- **Wilson**: "They call a hole in the sand their home."
- **Willow**: "Come out and play with me!"
- **Wolfgang**: "Crabbit is coward."
- **Wendy**: "A hole is just a grave that has yet to be covered."
- **WX-78**: "THE SHELLED ONES STILL FEEL THE NEED TO HIDE"
- **Wickerbottom**: "A burrowing creature resides here."
- **Woodie**: "That's where my crabbit buddies live."
- **Maxwell**: "It can't hide forever."
- **Wagstaff**: "I wonder how complex is their den system is." [sic]
- **Wigfrid**: "Döes shame drive them tö this höle?"
- **Webber**: "The sixlegger lives underground."
- **Walani**: "A beachfront home. Nice."
- **Warly**: "Come out, come out!"
- **Woodlegs**: "Ye got a nice 'ome thar, crabbit."

- **Wheeler**: "You're not fooling anyone hiding underground like that."
- **Choose**: Woodlegs

**Crabbit Dens** are naturally occurring objects from the **Shipwrecked** DLC. **Crabbits** spawn from the dens and roam near them during the day, running to their den at dusk. Unlike **Rabbits**, they do not go back to their dens when being chased but instead burrow into Shifting Sands. Crabbits go to sleep when they are outside of their dens at night and may be attacked.

Much like Rabbit Holes during Spring, most Crabbit Dens will collapse after the first rain in Monsoon Season, making Crabbits unavailable for the rest of the season.

### Prototype Tips
- Putting a **Trap** directly above a Crabbit Den will ensure a captured Crabbit most of the time.
- To attack a Crabbit, the player can walk up to it during the day and let it run (without following it) until it stops. Once the Crabbit has stopped, the player can walk up to the Crabbit without it burrowing and kill it.
- It is possible to force a Crabbit out of its den by digging the den up with a Shovel; however, this will destroy the den and prevent any more Crabbits from spawning there.
- It is also possible to force a Crabbit out of its den by digging up the Shifting Sands or Sandy Piles.

# Accomploshrine
The **Accomploshrine** is a craftable structure only available on the console versions of **Don't Starve**. It requires 10 **Gold Nuggets**, 1 **Cut Stone**, and 6 **Gears** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: I want to use it, and I want the world to know that I did.
- **Willow**: I hate that arrow!
- **Wolfgang**: I will defeat you, tiny arrow!
- **Wendy**: I've never much cared for metaphor.
- **WX-78**: I AM GOOD AT REPEATING TASKS
- **Wickerbottom**: I feel a compulsive urge to activate it, again and again.
- **Woodie**: It seems a bit show-offy to me.
- **Maxwell**: Even THEY couldn't build something so devious.
- **Wagstaff**: A puzzle! Let's hope it's a good one!
- **Wigfrid**: My victories shall be remembered!
- **Webber**: It gives me a goal in life.
- **Walani**: Well, that looks like a lot of busywork.
- **Warly**: I always wished to make a name for myself.
- **Woodlegs**: Ye be knowin' the glory of pirate Woodlegs, world!
- **Wilba**: WILBA HATH SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT!
- **Wormwood**: Pretty!
- **Wheeler**: Why would I do this? Because it's there.
- **Winona**: A testament to my achievements. Or lack of them.
- **Wortox**: I did indeed do that!
- **Wurt**: Done so many things, florp!
- **Walter**: I love checking tasks off a list!
- **Wanda**: I want to use it, and I want the world to know that I did.

## Description
The Accomploshrine's sole purpose is to grant two PSN/Xbox achievements. To attain the trophies, the player must first build the Accomploshrine to earn the "Look on my works, ye Mighty," achievement, then activate the Accomploshrine a total of 725 times within one game to earn the "...and despair!" achievement.

Each time the player turns the handle on the device, the cranking sound will play at a higher and higher pitch until the 25th crank. After every 25th activation, the shrine will release a firework with a similar light effect as **Lightning**, and the player's character will remark on their accomplishment. When the player obtains the "...and despair!" achievement, a bigger fireworks explosion, flags, and music will come out of the Accomploshrine, and the character will comment again on their achievement.

## Trivia
- Klei did not want to add any sort of achievements for **Don't Starve**, but Sony required them to do so for the PS4 release. This item was added begrudgingly as a jab at the pointlessness of achievements.
- The name of the two Accomploshrine achievements is a reference to Percy Bysshe Shelley's sonnet "Ozymandias", in which a broken statue with the inscription "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" is found in an empty desert; all the king's work was ultimately meaningless, just like the Accomploshrine and its achievements.
- Since this structure uses Gears and has no uses, besides being a cosmetic and situational light, it's unwise to build it more than once, though players might build these to show off material abundance.

## Structure Information
The Humble Lamb Idol is a craftable Structure exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced as part of the Cult of the Lamb Crossover. It can be upgraded by adding more materials into it. It requires 5 Cut Stone and 1 Log to be upgraded to an Improved Lamb Idol (Level 2), then 10 Gold Nuggets, 10 Cut Stone and 1 Log to be upgraded to an Immaculate Lamb Idol (Level 3). The Idol works like a Fire Pit, but also gives sanity over time to nearby players while lit. There are different visuals for each upgrade level. With each upgrade, the maximum fuel capacity and sanity aura is improved. At its max level, the fuel capacity is greater than that of the Fire Pit.

| Level | Fuel Capacity | Sanity Aura |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Humble | 120 seconds  | +6.25/min  |
| Improved | 240 seconds | +10/min    |
| Immaculate | 480 seconds | +25/min    |

The Rare Blueprint for the Idol is obtained by feeding the Red Crown trinket (found in Crumpled Packages fished from the Lake at the Oasis) to Antlion.

## Trivia
The files contain descriptions for crafting the other two levels.
- Level 2: "A refined statue to celebrate the lamb."
- Level 3: "A dazzling monument to the lamb's glory."
