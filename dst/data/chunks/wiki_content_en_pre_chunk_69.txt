# Fragile Rose

## Overview
The **Fragile Rose** is an item that can be obtained by **Winona** using the **Shadow Seeker II** skill. To acquire a Fragile Rose, the player must equip **Rose-Colored Glasses** and closely examine a **Flower** or **Rose**. Upon examination, the Flower will transform into a Rose, which can then be picked up by clicking on it again. The player can also examine it once more to dismiss it, leaving the Flower as a Rose.

## Resurrection Mechanics
When Winona dies with a Fragile Rose in her inventory, she will immediately respawn near a **Night Light** with all items, without a max health penalty. If there are no Night Lights in the world, the player will respawn at the **Florid Postern** instead. A Rose will appear at the place where the player died, and Winona is resurrected by Charlie.

Once resurrected, the player retains the same **Hunger** and **Sanity** levels as before death but only has 50 **Health**, similar to other methods of resurrection.

## Storage and Movement
The Fragile Rose will instantly disappear if dropped on the ground. It cannot be moved to a **Backpack** or any other **storage container**.

## Tips
- The player can have more than one Fragile Rose, but only one Rose will be used for each resurrection.
- If Winona dies near a flower, the newly planted Rose will pop the flower off and drop a petal on the ground.
- There is a low chance for a Rose to appear when planting a butterfly, but Winona can use this skill to turn a Flower bed into a Rose garden.
- If the player dies in **Caves** without a **Night Light**, they will resurrect at the place they died.

## Usage

- **Butter Muffins**: Can be used to create Butter Muffins in a Crock Pot.
- **Farming**: Easily farmed by setting up a Butterfly Farm, with Beefalo in heat, Hounds, or even Catcoons.
- **Tumbleweeds**: Can be acquired by destroying Tumbleweeds; doing this will not provoke Krampus.
- **Befriending Catcoons**: Can be given to Catcoons to befriend them.

## Recipes
1. **Glossamer Saddle**: ![Recipe](Living%20Log) x2 + ![Silk](Silk) x4 + ![Butterfly Wings](Butterfly%20Wings) x68
2. **Manure**: ![Butterfly Wings](Butterfly%20Wings) + Manure
3. **Butter Muffin**: ![Butterfly Wings](Butterfly%20Wings) + ![Vegetables](Vegetables) + ![Filler](Filler) (not Meats or Mandrake)

## Tips
- Butterfly Wings are a good healing item during early game and in a pinch. They provide the same amount of healing as Spider Glands do. However, Butterfly Wings can be obtained easier, and with less risk.
- Unlike Spider Glands, Butterfly Wings spoil over time, and are difficult to obtain during the Night or Winter.
- While the Spider Glands can be used to make Healing Salves, Butterfly Wings can be used to make Butter Muffins to heal the same amount of additional hit points, however the latter requires a Crock Pot.
- Even though it is dropped by an animal, it is not considered meat. This means it cannot be eaten by Wigfrid, but can be eaten by Wurt.

## Recipe

### Examples

- 1 Raw Fish + 1 Ice
- 2 Ice Bream + 2 Monster Meat

## Trivia
- Ceviche was introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Warly Character Update.
- Ceviche is a popular seafood dish in the coastal areas of Latin America, typically made with fresh raw fish cured in citrus juice and spiced with chili peppers or aji (a sauce made of tomatoes, cilantro, aji peppers, onions, and water).

# The Trade Inn

The **Trade Inn** (or Trade INN) is a feature exclusive to **[Don't Starve Together](https://www.dontstarvetogether.com/)**. It is used to trade in multiple common **Skins** for rarer ones. The machine works by taking nine items of the same tier and giving the player a single skin a tier higher. However, there is a rare chance of the machine giving out a rarer skin that is two, three, or even four tiers higher (capped at **Elegant**).

![The Trade Inn interface](DST-TradeInn.jpg)

The Trade Inn is run by the Curio Collector, a mysterious, elderly, seemingly veteran survivor of the **Constant** who wears a thick Beefalo fur coat and speaks in a heavy southern accent.

![The mysterious Curio Collector](Beefalobloke.png)

## Curio Collector Games

### Ravin' Wrapper Raiders

![Curio Collector Mini Game](Curio%20Collector%20Mini%20Game.png)

"I've done witnessed a murder! And they're stealin' all my hard-earned candy wrappers!" - Curio Collector

'**Ravin' Wrapper Raiders**' is a minigame added to the Trade Inn during the **Hallowed Nights** 2019 event. Players can enter the game by clicking on the crow. The usual Trade Inn interface changes to an 8 x 5 grid with tiles containing a random assortment of candy wrappers and at least one crow. The premise of the game is that the crows have stolen the Curio Collector's candy wrapper collection and it is up to the player to help him scare the crows away.

The game is a tile-matching puzzle similar to **SameGame** wherein the player clears groups of adjoining tiles by clicking on them. Clearing tiles close to crows causes the birds to flee. More wrappers and crows fall from the top of the game screen to replace the cleared tiles. The player can equip 5 different tools from a row of buttons at the bottom of the Trade Inn interface. These tools have different effects to help clear tiles. The game starts with 3 of each tool available. Clearing 10 or more tiles at a time will earn the player a bonus tool from the Curio Collector. The game ends when there are no more possible moves and all tools are used up.

Completing the game with a certain amount of points will reward the player with the Curio Collector **Profile Icon**.

### A Feastin' Pair of Birds

![Afeastinpairofbirds](Afeastinpairofbirds.png)

"Let's play a game! Use that big brain to match pairs of food from the feast!" - Curio Collector

'**A Feastin' Pair of Birds**' is a minigame added during the **Winter's Feast** 2019 event. To access the game, the player must click on the Snowbird on the top left of the Trade Inn interface. Similar to usual mix and match memory games, the game requires the player to memorize the tiles and match them correctly. When a match is created, two tiles fall into the 3 x 2 grid, showing the tiles until the player skips, then flipping over. The game ends when/if the player runs out of their 3 starting guesses. There are only 5 types of tiles to ensure that there is always at least one match. If two Snow bird tiles are cleared, the player will gain an additional guess. The goal of the game is to get the highest score.

If the player gets a score of 10 or more matches, they will be rewarded with a Snowbird **Profile Icon**.

### An Eggy Tally

'**An Eggy Tally**' is a minigame that was added as part of the **Return of Them#Troubled Waters** update. Players can start the game by clicking on the **Redbird** in the Trade Inn interface. The game is a timed mental-math puzzle in which numbers in vertically/horizontally adjacent squares can be additionally combined with the goal of making as many 100's as possible. When a 100 is formed, the square containing that 100 is permanently replaced by a fresh egg (if the 100 was created before the timer ran out) or a rotten egg (if the 100 was created after the timer ran out); however, the egg will remain on the board, permanently occupying its square and gradually increasing the difficulty of forming future 100's. The game will not allow any squares to go beyond 100 in value. The game ends when there are no possible number combinations left on the board.

If the player gets a rotten egg on the board, they will be rewarded with a Rotten Egg **Profile Icon**.

If the player gets 6 or more fresh eggs on the board,

# Accursed Trinket

The **Accursed Trinket** is an item exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** introduced in the **The Curse of Moon Quay** update.

### Item Info

- **Perk:** Player transforms into **Wonkey**
- **Stack:** 10
- **Spawn Code:** "cursed_monkey_token"
- **Dropped By:** 
  ![Prime Mate](https://wiki.gamepedia.com/images/thumb/8/8e/Prime_Mate.png/32px-Prime_Mate.png)
  ![Powder Monkey](https://wiki.gamepedia.com/images/thumb/7/77/Powder_Monkey.png/32px-Powder_Monkey.png)

### Quotes
- **Wilson:** It seems harmless.
- **Willow:** Is that a real tooth on it? Haha, cool.
- **Wolfgang:** Gives Wolfgang the heebiddy jeebies.
- **Wendy:** It has an aura of malevolence... and monkeyness.
- **WX-78:** GET IT AWAY FROM MEEEE
- **Wickerbottom:** Primitive jewelry.
- **Woodie:** I know a curse when I see it.
- **Maxwell:** Disgusting!

- **Wormwood:** Ooooh, pretty danglies
- **Wurt:** Oooooh, pretty!
- **Walter:** This is definitely going in my collection.
- **Wanda:** That is one trinket I'd rather not have cluttering my pockets.
- **Choose:** woodie

### Exclusivity
Don't Starve Together

Accursed Trinkets are received automatically any time a **Powder Monkey** is killed, unless the player is too far away. They cannot be dropped or transferred to any other storage container without being returned immediately back to the inventory, effectively reducing the player by one inventory slot.

When the player dies, the Accursed Trinkets will drop on the ground and will disappear if left on the ground for 4 minutes (half of in-game day).

### Curse
As more trinkets are obtained the player starts to slowly resemble a monkey and at ten trinkets the user fully transforms into **Wonkey**. In order to get rid of Accursed Trinkets the player can give **Bananas** to the **Queen of Moon Quay**. For every banana four trinkets will be taken. Once transformed the player needs to lose all the trinkets in order to transform back to their original character.

| Count | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | Monkey feet |
| 3     | Monkey hands |
| 6     | Monkey tail |
| 10    | Character turns into **Wonkey** |

### Tips
- It's possible to get rid of trinkets by dying next to **Lureplant**. They will be destroyed after some time within it.
- Another way to get rid of them would be dying in the caves and pushing every trinket off the edge of the map while in ghost form.

Meatballs is a [Meat](#) [Food](#) item cooked in the [Crock Pot](#) by combining any Meats and fillers excluding [Inedibles](#). However, adding 3.0 units of Meats will result in [Meaty Stew](#) instead. It takes 15 seconds to cook.

Adding 2 or more [Monster Food](#)s will result in [Monster Lasagna](#), unless [Twigs](#) are also added, which will then result in [Wet Goop](#). Adding [Honey](#) will result in [Honey Nuggets](#) or [Honey Ham](#). Adding a [Mandrake](#) will result in [Mandrake Soup](#). Adding [Eggplant](#) and another [Vegetable](#) will result in [Stuffed Eggplant](#). Using less than 1.0 units of Meats ''and'' using at least two [Ice](#) as fillers will result in [Bunny Stew](#).

Meatballs are a decent starter recipe for [Hunger](#), especially when only working with [Monster Meat](#). There are better alternatives, such as [Meaty Stew](#), [Honey Ham](#), [Bacon and Eggs](#), that provide more [Health](#) and [Hunger](#) gain, or longer spoilage time. Attention should be paid to the ingredients used as depending on the recipe, meatballs may provide little to no hunger over their components (e.g. 1 Meat and 3 Carrots will provide no additional hunger).

## Recipe
- **Item 1**: Meats (0.25)
- **Item 2**: Filler (3)
- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Meatballs
- **Note**: Filler cannot be [Inedibles](#).

## Examples
### Recipe 1
- **Item 1**: Monster Meats
- **Item 2**: Red Cap (3)
- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Meatballs
- **Note**: A recipe for Meatballs that extracts a lot of useful hunger value out of harmful ingredients.

### Recipe 2
- **Item 1**: Morsels

# Fleshy Bulb

![Fleshy Bulb Dropped](Fleshy Bulb Dropped.png) ![Fleshy Bulb](Fleshy Bulb.png) ![Lureplant](Lureplant.png)

**Fleshy Bulb** is an item dropped by **Lureplants** when killed. When planted by the player, it will spawn a new Lureplant. If the newly spawned Lureplant is killed, it will also drop a Fleshy Bulb. Despite being plant material, Fleshy Bulbs cannot be eaten and do not spoil.

- **Stack**: 10
- **Burn Time**: Fuel (3 minutes)

It will take 2 days for a freshly planted bulb to turn into an active Lureplant, and taking its lure will reset the Lureplant to its "just planted" state. Bulbs planted too close to each other will block the movement of the player and Mobs.

**Flammability**: Fleshy Bulbs are flammable and can be used as fuel for Campfires and Fire Pits.

# Hallowed Trinkets

Exclusive to the **Hallowed Nights** event, Hallowed Trinkets can be found scattered around the world, dug up from **Graves**, or destroyed from **Ancient Pseudoscience Stations**. They can be traded with the **Pig King** for various amounts of **Gold Nuggets** and 8-9 **Halloween Candies**. If the player is wearing costumes, Pig King will give more Halloween Candies. Outside of the Hallowed Nights event, the Pig King will not give Halloween Candies. The Hallowed Trinkets stack up to 40 items and can also be used as a **Catcoon** toy.

The **California Roll** is a Crock Pot recipe introduced in the **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. It is made by combining 1.0 unit of **Fish** and exactly 2 **Kelp Fronds**. It restores 20 HP, 37.5 Hunger, and 10 Sanity.

Adding 3 Kelp Fronds will result in **Meatballs**. Adding **Wobster** for the fish requirement and **Ice** or **Butter** as a filler will instead result in **Lobster Bisque** and **Lobster Dinner** respectively.

![Eyes](Eyes.png){: .right width="75px"} 

## Eyes

Eyes appear in total darkness when the player's Sanity is below 80%. They do not affect the player in any way, and will disappear when approached. As the player loses Sanity, more Eyes will spawn, appearing more intense with lower Sanity. Trees and other obstacles can block eyes, commonly forming a one-eyed Shadow Creature.

In **Epilogue: Checkmate** of [Adventure Mode](#), Eyes will be visible in the darkness regardless of the player's Sanity.

# Don't Starve: Pocket Edition

Don't Starve: Pocket Edition was released on July 9, 2015 for Apple and Android devices. The first version of the game included all the content of the Reign of Giants DLC, with very minor changes. A second app was released on December 26, 2016, and included all the content in the Shipwrecked DLC.

## Differences between Pocket Edition and other Platforms

Unlike other ports of Don't Starve, Pocket Edition's controls comprise of three(3) buttons and an optional joystick wheel. The buttons, one red with a black fist, one green with a splayed hand and an orange button with a "cycle" symbol, are displayed on the right side of the screen. The red button can be used to attack the closest mob to the player, excluding followers. Alternatively, the player can attack hostile creatures by tapping on them while holding a tool or weapon. The green button is used to perform most other actions such as picking up items and harvesting plants. The Orange button allows the player to repeatedly craft the last item/structure created if they have the necessary materials. If the last item created is a structure, the player will have to move in order to create the new structure.

A sprite of the structure/plant that the player wants to position will appear in front of the player's character in the intuition to help in the construction of the base, if it is possible to place the object it will be green, otherwise it will be red.

Due to limitations of the controls, it is currently impossible to access certain character's examination quotes relating to certain mobs or structures, especially if the mob/structure has a storage use. This also applies to unharvested resources, as touching it will automatically send the player to collect it. (Using Bluetooth controller makes it possible for all quotes to be accessed) 

Another trade-in of the mobile platform is that game world and sprite resolution is of noticeably lower quality. This is presumably due to the limitations of the window and graphics engine. Cinematic elements, such as non-player Maxwell's appearances, still appear in higher resolution due to their simpler purpose and requirements.

In World Customization/Reign of Giants settings, there is a new preset named No-Sweat Mode, an easier game mode, allowing for a more relaxed play style.

## No-Sweat Mode

No-Sweat mode is a preset only available in the Reign of Giants DLC and is meant for less experienced players. Many features can be modified or even turned off, such as Hunger, Freezing, and attacks from Charlie. No-Sweat Mode is available both for the Apple and Android version of the game.

### Changes made in No-Sweat Mode

- The player takes 35% less damage.
- Sanity loss during Dusk and Night is -2.5/minute.
- Hunger drains slower, and when dying of hunger, Health is lost at 0.5/sec. Health will only drain to 25% of the player's total health.
- When Woodie is in Werebeaver form, he does 50% more damage and the log meter drains slower.
- The Player respawns at the Compromising Statue after dying instead of the world being deleted.
- No effects from low Sanity. The Nightmare Amulet and Nightmare Lights still spawn Shadow Creatures.
- No attacks from Charlie, the brightness appears the same as when on a full moon. Pigs do turn into Werepigs, Glommer does not spawn, etc.
- No death by Freezing.
- Deerclops and Summer (Reign of Giants) are automatically set to "None".
- Hound Attacks are automatically set to "Less".
- Naturally spawning Carrots are automatically set to "More".
- Trees and other plants grow faster.

## Bugs

- While using "Tap to move", after using the green button and selecting the inventory at the same time, the controls may freeze, making the player unable to move. This can be combated by using the control wheel instead.
- It's possible for no Giants to spawn, even if they are all set to default. It randomly happens in specific worlds and only those worlds, meaning if a world has spawned a giant once, one will never experience this bug in that world. This is caused by a bug in the world generation.
- There is a chance for the world to not generate both of the desert biomes if the game is set to "no-sweat mode" resulting in dragonfly not spawning permanently, This is caused by a bug in the world generation and the option for dragonfly being automatically off that messes the game world generation up.
- Giants can spawn when they aren't supposed to. This can mean spawning even when they are set to "none" and/or out of their intended season. This is caused by a bug in the world generation.
- In Adventure Mode, when escaping one world and going into

## Known Riddle Pieces

Each item given to Wolly gives you a piece of the riddle for that particular item. Each player gets a certain piece of it, but different people get different pieces. These can be aligned by their overlap[^1].

- **Sextant**: Hinged, plated, or spiraled, this armor was not made by man.
- **Sea Worther**: Smaller than a stone, smaller than a pebble, yet I cover great expanses.
- **Toy Boat**: A vessel of potential, potential no more. What was once loved, we now abhor.
- **Old Boot**: You give me to every new person you meet, but I still remain yours and sound so sweet.
- **Soaked Candle**: Two old ones made the new one I hold. I move as if in ocean's fold.

## Riddle Answers

Entering the corresponding answer to the riddle for the card shown on the [Wolly website](http://dontstarvegame.com/wolly/) gives a new card. However, the item that gave the riddle does not match the card for which the answer must be given for that riddle.

| Riddle Card | Answer | Answer Card |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Toy Boat    | Shell  | [Carapace](http://assets.kleicdn.com/public/wolly/images/cards/back/CARAPACE.png) |
| Old Boot    | Sand   | [Shale](http://assets.kleicdn.com/public/wolly/images/cards/back/SHALE.png)       |
| Soaked Candle | Corpse | [Departed](http://assets.kleicdn.com/public/wolly/images/cards/back/DEPARTED.png) |
| Sextant     | Name   | [Signature](http://assets.kleicdn.com/public/wolly/images/cards/back/SIGNATURE.png) |
| Sea Worther | Cradle | [Bassinet](http://assets.kleicdn.com/public/wolly/images/cards/back/BASSINET.png) |

## First Card Puzzle

There are dots that are present in the background of each of the cards. They align along a grid of 9 columns and 26 rows. In each column, only one of the dots is present on all cards. The row positions of these dots, starting from the top, are 4, 9, 19, 3, 5, 19, 19, 21, and 13. Using 1 = A, 2 = B, and so on, this spells DISCESSUM (Latin for "departure"). Giving Wolly the answer "DISCESSUM" reveals another page with cards for the second set of cards depicting the answers to the riddles for the first set.[^2]

## Second Card Puzzle

The second set of cards has words in the background, as well as two symbols: a seahorse and an anchor. Aligning all the cards on top of each other by the seahorse and anchor symbols, a set of words line up to spell out another riddle[^3]:

  With my shell on the bottom, I stood so tall.
  'Til my cradle compelled me to obstinate goal.
  Now my lives are all gone, my corpse among sand.
  My first name's my being; And second my end.

## Final Answer

The answer to the last riddle is "shipwrecked" -- the first name, "ship" is its being, and second, "wrecked", is its end. Entering [http://www.dontstarvegame.com/shipwrecked](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/shipwrecked) takes you to the announcement for [[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked]].

## Quotes

This is the list of all possible quotes that the Wolly puzzle page can display:

- Greeting

Guacamole is a Meat Food item introduced in the Reign of Giants DLC. It is cooked in the Crock Pot by combining 1 Moleworm and 1 raw Cactus Flesh or raw Ripe Stone Fruit.

Adding Corn and Fish may yield Fish Tacos instead. Adding 2 Raw Drumsticks may result in Turkey Dinner. Adding 1.0 unit of Meats and 1 Vegetables may result in Spicy Chili. Adding Mandrake may produce Mandrake Soup.

Many combinations to make this recipe would result in a net loss to hunger compared to eating the individual components. It is suggested to use a filler such as Twigs to improve its Hunger restoration.

Wurt cannot eat this, despite calling it yummy in her inspection quote.

Guacamole is also required to adopt an Ewelet at the Rock Den.

# Planar Entity Protection (Don't Starve Together)

## Overview
**Planar Entity Protection** is a unique trait exclusive to some **Don't Starve Together** mobs. It functions as natural armor.

Planar entity protection is a unique type of damage reduction, applicable to planar mobs introduced in **From Beyond**. It acts similarly to **Armor's Protection**; it reduces the **Physical Damage** mobs receive, not affecting other kinds of damage like **Planar Damage**, **Fire** or **Food** damage. However, planar entity protection effectiveness increases with the amount of physical damage dealt in a hit, protecting from more damage the stronger the attack is.

## Formula
The formula for calculating how much hit damage will be taken by a mob with planar entity protection is:
\[ \text{Damage Taken} = (\sqrt{\text{Physical Damage} \times 4 + 64} - 8) \times 4 + \text{Planar Damage} \]

## Examples

- A **Dark Sword** normally deals 68 physical damage, but only deals 41 to targets with planar entity protection, resulting in a -39.7% damage decrease.
- A **Blow Dart** deals 100 physical damage, but only deals 54 to targets with planar entity protection, with a -46.8% damage decrease.
- A single **Gunpowder** deals 200 physical damage, but only deals 85 to targets with planar entity protection, with a -57.5% damage decrease.
- A full stack of 40 Gunpowder deals 8,000 physical damage, but only deals 684 to targets with planar entity protection, with a -91.5% damage decrease. This is not enough to instantly kill a **Deadly Brightshade**.

# Exclusivity: Don't Starve Together

![Spools](Spools.png){: width="90px" align="right"}

## Spool System

The **Spool** system is a method of obtaining **Curio Items** in **Don't Starve Together**. All items with the **Woven** rarity tag can be unraveled into Spools. More common items such as **Profile Icons** give substantially less Spools than the more valuable items such as rare **Skins**. The Spools can be used to weave items with the **Woven and Inspired** rarity modifier. The amount of Spools required to create an item is three times greater than the Spools obtained from unraveling it, meaning that Spools should be spent wisely.

The number of Spools needed to weave a Curio item and the number of Spools granted upon unraveling it depends on the rarity of the item:

| Rarity of item | Cost to weave | Spools obtained from unraveling |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Common        | 15           | 5                            |
| Classy        | 45           | 15                           |
| Spiffy        | 150          | 50                           |
| Distinguished | 450          | 150                          |
| Elegant       | 1350         | 450                          |

For Curio items of **Heirloom** rarity, players will gain three times the amount of Spools they receive for items of the regular rarity. For example, unraveling an Heirloom Elegant item will grant 1350 Spools instead of 450.

As players can get a total of 15 Curios per week through daily gifts and random drops, they can obtain around 485.775 Spools per week at an average of 32.385 Spools per item.

### Trivia

* The Spools system was introduced alongside **The Forge** event in 2017 as an alternative to the **Trade Inn**.

Waffles serve as a good alternative for Warly to make use of butter in the absence of honey and sufficient fruit for Fresh Fruit Crepes. In both Shipwrecked and Hamlet, certain trees will drop eggs, though in Shipwrecked Jungle Trees will also drop banana that can satisfy the fruit requirement for Crepes.

## Trivia

It restores 3 **HP** and 9.375 **Hunger** (12.1875 when eaten by **Wortox**), with a stack size of 40 and a spoil time of 6 days. It is considered a **Veggie** and has a **Fruit** food value of 1.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It looks like the inside of an alien's brain."
- Willow: "Is it supposed to have this many parts?"
- Wolfgang: "Look like smartypants brain."
- Wendy: "So many juicy red bits to chomp and squish!"

- Winona: "Eat that and you're stuck here forever!"
- Wortox: "You need only eat one seed. Hyuyu!"
- Wurt: "Ohhh, you not supposed to just bite into it?"
- Walter: "Fruit guts!"
- Wanda: "Who wants to spend time picking out every individual seed?"

## Usage
Pomegranate can be cooked on a **Campfire**, **Fire Pit**, or **Star** to create **Sliced Pomegranate**, which restores 20 **HP** and slightly more **Hunger** than the raw version but has a halved spoilage time. It can also be used in **Crock Pot** recipes and as an alternative to healing items like **Healing Salve**s and **Honey Poultice**s.

## Sliced Pomegranate
**Sliced Pomegranate** is a **Fruit** **Food** item made by cooking a **Pomegranate**. It restores 20 **HP** and 12.5 **Hunger** (13.75 for **Wortox**), with a stack size of 40 and a spoil time of 3 days.

## Quotes for Sliced Pomegranate
- Wilson: "Haute Cuisine!"
- Willow: "Fire always makes things better."
- Wolfgang: "Ha ha ha! I cook brain! Not so smart now."

- Wurt: "Hmm... okay..."
- Walter: "I thought it would taste better."
- Wanda: "It seemed like a better idea in my head."

## Recipes
- **Pomegranate** to **Sliced Pomegranate** (requires fire)
- **Pomegranate** to **Windblown Seeds** (when fed to a bird)
- **Pomegranates** to **Manure** (manure production)

## Tips
It's not efficient for **Wortox** to eat a Pomegranate to deal with hunger, as the bonus is almost non-existent. It's better to use it in a **Crock Pot** or as a healing alternative.

## Scrapbook Info
Can be unwrapped to release items inside.

The Crumpled Package is an Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in A New Reign. It can be obtained by fishing in the Lake at the Oasis. Similar to Bundled Supplies, Crumpled Packages contain items, that will be dropped when opened.

## Contents
Most packages contain Trinkets, making them renewable. Some special Trinkets, like the Beach Toy and the Red Crown, can only be acquired by finding it inside a Crumpled Package. However, it may also contain the rare Blueprint for the Desert Goggles, as well as various other Blueprints. The chance for a player of getting the rare blueprints decreases after they have been learnt.

| Item | Chance (Before Desert Goggles learned) | Chance (After Desert Goggles learned) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Melty Marbles | 13% | 13% |
| Gord's Knot | 13% | 13% |
| Hardened Rubber Bung | 13% | 13% |
| Mismatched Buttons | 13% | 13% |
| Potato Cup | 1.3% | 1.3% |
| Blueprint | 6.5% | 6.5% |
| Red Crown | 13% | 13% |
| Blueprint (rare) Desert Goggles | 26% | 1.3% |
| Beach Toy | 1.3% | 26% |

## Tips
- During Winter's Feast event, the 4 common trinkets each have a 50% chance to be replaced by Festive Baubles (plain or fancy), or Festive Lights.
- It's possible to save the game before opening Crumpled Packages, and if none of the items dropped are desired, one can rollback the save to before the Crumpled Packages were opened and try again. 
  - It must be noted that the player must load a rollback from the server menu rather than the in-game options, or else repeatedly loading a rollback can cause the game to always load the previous one.
  - It's recommended to learn the Desert Goggles crafting recipe before doing this, to increase the drop rate of standard Blueprints

## Trivia
- Crumpled Packages were introduced in the Against the Grain update.

# Curio Cabinet

![Curio Cabinet Interface](Curio%20Cabinet%20Interface.png)

"*For getting dolled up.*" - Winona

The **Curio Cabinet** is an **Interface** feature exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It allows the player to view Curios they have collected in their inventory. There are seven different types of Curios: **Skins**, **Belongings**, **Emotes**, **Emoticons**, **Portrait Frames**, **Profile Icons**, **Beards**, and **Vignettes**.

![The Gift Box](Gift%20Icon.png)

All Curios except Vignettes, Portrait Frames and Profile Icons are collected at random times while playing on a **Don't Starve Together** server, and the timing is weighted so that users who play an average amount in a week should get a few gifts, and those who play a decent amount should get the full maximum. [Timing of Skin Drops - Klei Forums](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/60634-presents/?page=0#comment-696509) Players can get a maximum of 15 Curios from randomly timed drops per week; this count resets every Thursday around 1pm PST, before [Klei's weekly Twitch broadcast](https://www.twitch.tv/kleientertainment). The arrival of a randomly timed drop will be signaled by a gift box appearing in the top-left corner of the screen and a sound similar to ripping paper. After this, the player must go to a **Science Machine** or **Alchemy Engine** to open the gift. When a whistle plays and the research station starts producing streams of shadows, it can be opened and the Curio will be obtained. The player has to be active in order to receive Curios, and must open the earlier gift box to receive the next one.

Players will additionally receive a daily gift by logging into the game. These gifts arrive upon entering the main menu of the game. Together with the 8 randomly timed drops ingame, this allows for a maximum of 15 Curios to obtain per week. [Winona Character Update & Drop System Changes](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/103604-winona-character-update-drop-system-changes/) Some Curios are obtainable during the official duration of an ingame **Event**.

Curios are classified into different tiers of rarity. Items of **Common**, **Classy**, **Spiffy**, **Distinguished**, or **Elegant** rarity are always tradable and marketable, unless marked with an **Event** or **Seasonal** modifier. The drop rates are depending on the Curios' rarity, higher tier Curios have a lower chance of dropping ingame:

- **Common:** 52.7%
- **Classy:** 26.0%
- **Spiffy:** 13.0%
- **Distinguished:** 6.0%
- **Elegant:** 2.3%

Items of **Loyal**, **Timeless**, **Event**, **Proof of Purchase**, **Reward**, or **Heirloom** rarity are unobtainable from the weekly random drops and are instead obtained through other means. None of these except **Heirloom** are tradable or marketable.

Players using [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) are able to trade Curios with other players or to buy and sell them on the Community Market. Regular Skins and Belongings can be used in the **Trade Inn** interface, where a player can exchange nine unwanted Skins for a Skin of higher rarity. Unwanted Curios, except for those of **Loyal**, **Timeless**, **Event**, or **Reward** rarity can additionally be unraveled into **Spools**, which can then be woven into items with an **Event**, **Seasonal** or **Classic** modifier. Curios received from gifts give an average of 32.385 Spools when unraveled. For example, buying one of the 4 main purchasable characters (**Wortox**, **Wurt**, **Wanda** and **Wormwood**) costs 2,700 Spools, which (on average) would take about 83 gifts, which in turn would take just over 5 and a half weeks while getting the maximum amount of gifts mentioned above (15 gifts / week). Alternatively, players can purchase Event-applicable and **Character**-themed **Treasure Chests** from **Klei Entertainment** directly through Steam.

## Features

- **Wardrobe:** The Wardrobe (not to be confused with the in-game structure) is where the Character Skins are contained. This includes Skins for the characters' Head, Body

# Extra-Adorable Lavae

## Overview
The **Extra-Adorable Lavae** is a follower exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. She has 250 **health** and can be hatched from the **Lavae Egg**. The Lavae will follow the **Lavae Tooth** that dropped from the same egg as she spawned from. She will provide light, heat, and allows food to be cooked on her body, like a **Campfire** and **Dwarf Star**. The Extra-Adorable Lavae is smaller than the hostile **Lavae**, allowing them to be distinguished a little easier. Extra-Adorable Lavae is immune to fire.

## Attributes
- **Health**: 250
- **Damage**: 
- **Diet**: **Burnt** [Food Type](#)
- **Special Ability**: Sets anything near it on fire after standing around it for a while. Provides light, heat, and allows food to be cooked.
- **Spawn Code**: "lavae_pet"
- **Spawn From**: [Lavae Egg](#)
- **Walk Speed**: 7.5
- **Drops**: Regular: **Fire** x3, Frozen: **Chilled Lavae**

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: Aww. Who's a good monster?
- **Willow**: She's... perfect.
- **Wolfgang**: Tiny baby seems happy.
- **Wendy**: A spark of life illuminating the darkness.
- **WX-78**: IT SERVES ME.
- **Wickerbottom**: A healthy larval dragonfly.
- **Woodie**: That's my lil critter.
- **Maxwell**: You're not a hellbeast, are you? Nooo. Just misunderstood!
- **Wigfrid**: A faithful, fiery friend.
- **Webber**: It's my friend.
- **Winona**: Seems friendly enough.
- **Warly**: She's a fiery little one.
- **Wortox**: What a happy wyrm you are.
- **Wormwood**: Hot!
- **Wurt**: She give warm cuddles.
- **Walter**: You're the best grub in the whole wide world!
- **Wanda**: She seems to like me for some reason.
- **Choose**: Willow

## Care and Feeding
Lavae eat **Ashes** and **Charcoal** and will starve if they don't eat enough. If a Lavae gets very hungry, she will set things on fire on her own so she can eat, ignoring the player. Like **Smallbirds**, Lavae will starve to death (after 2 days, or 16 real minutes) if they can't find anything to eat, so she must be constantly fed. Ashes and Charcoal both restore 18.75% each (6 clock segments, or 3 real minutes) of Lavae's hunger.

If a Lavae is frozen, it will turn into a rock and die after a while unless she is hit. She takes 3 hits from the **Ice Staff** to be frozen. Upon death, Lavae's Tooth will turn to Ashes. The Lavae will then become a **Chilled Lavae**.

## Tips
- Packing the **Lavae Tooth** in **Bundling Wrap** will also package the Extra-Adorable Lavae, halting her hunger depletion and loss of warmth, saving her from potential attackers until the bundling wrap is reopened.
- Feeding the Lavae either charcoal or ash will heal her for 20 health each.
- Lavae are very useful in **Winter** as they are essentially walking campfires, though they produce less light.
- The heat Lavae radiate is enough to set objects on fire, so caution is advised.
- Inspecting Lavae will tell where her hunger currently resides. (Ex: Webber says "It's my friend!" at 100%-76%, "Happy Lavae" at 75%-51%, "Poor hungry Lavae" at 51%-26%, and "It's starving!" under 26%)
- The Lavae is one of the few companions that can follow the player between the **Caves** and the overworld.
- The **Scaled Furnace** does not heat **her**.

## Trivia
The name Lavae is a portmanteau of lava, and the plural of larva (larvae), a juvenile stage of some insects. The Extra-Adorable part of the name refers to this Lavae's specific smaller size.
