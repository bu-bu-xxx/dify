# Cactus

## Overview
The **Cactus** is a type of flora found exclusively in the **Desert** biome in **Don't Starve Together**. It can be harvested for **Cactus Flesh** at the cost of 6 **Health**. Wearing armor reduces the damage taken. Cacti drop **Cactus Flesh** in any season and **Cactus Flower** only in **Summer**.

## Characteristics
- **Image**: ![Cactus](Cactus.png) ![Oasis Cactus](Oasis Cactus.png)
- **Pickable**: Yes, yielding **Cactus Flesh** and **Cactus Flower**
- **Burnable**: Yes
- **Biome**: Desert
- **Spawn Code**: "cactus", "oasis_cactus"
- **Renewal**: No

## Quotes
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang not like sharp plant."
- Wilson: "Sharp but delicious."
- Willow: "Spines! My weakness! How did you know?"
- Woodie: "That's gonna hurt."
- Maxwell: "Puffer plant."
- And more...

## Tips
- Wearing a **Bramble Husk** allows the player to pick cacti without health loss and without damaging the armor, making **Wormwood** an effective Cactus farmer.
- Using a **Football Helmet** or **Log Suit** negates most of the health loss when picking cacti, reducing it to 1.2 damage, and eating the cooked flesh further reduces it to 0.2.

## Trivia
- There appears to be a dug-up version in image files, but there is no known way to dig one up.
- The Cactus is modeled after the typical **Barrel Cactus**.
- The Oasis Cactus variant was introduced in the **Against the Grain** update.
- Since the update **The Curse of Moon Quay**, Cacti are renewable due to regrowth.

The Howlitzer is a craftable [[Weapon#Ranged weapons|Ranged Weapon]] exclusive to ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'', introduced in ''[[From Beyond]]''. It can only be crafted while next to the [[Brightsmithy Filter|Brightsmithy]]. It requires 1 filled [[Spark Ark]], 3 [[Brightshade Husk]]s, 3 [[Pure Brilliance]], and 3 [[Moon Rock]]s to craft and cannot be prototyped.

The Howlitzer is a blowpipe, and shoots its ammunition in a similar manner to [[Dart]]s. However, unlike Darts, this item is not consumed when used. Similar to [[Walter]]'s [[Trusty Slingshot]], the Howlitzer doesn't have a durability; it can be loaded with [[Hound's Tooth|Hound's Teeth]] as the ammunition in the same manner as Walter's [[Slingshot Ammo]]. On each use, 1 Hound's Tooth is consumed, and it deals 34 physical damage + 34 [[Planar Damage]] to the target. Additionally, it deals 10% more damage to [[Shadow Aligned]] targets.

## Tips
*Due to its range, damage, and infinite uses as long as Hound's Teeth are available, this item is the best ranged weapon once obtained.
*By the time this item becomes available, which is after the defeat of the [[Celestial Champion]] and [[Lunar Rift]] activation, the player should have a large number of Hound's Teeth lying around in their base already, ready for use as the ammunition.
*Even in the situation where there are no Hound's Teeth left, as the Spark Ark is given to the players by [[Grainy Transmission|Wagstaff]] after killing one of each [[Crystal Deerclops]], [[Armored Bearger]], and [[Possessed Varg]], players are guaranteed to have at least some Hound's Teeth for going after the Varg and its summoned [[Hound]]s.

## Trivia
* The Howlitzer was introduced in the ''[[From Beyond#Host of Horrors|Host of Horrors]]'' update.
* On beta release prior to update 576123, the Howlitzer did not drop the Spark Ark when deconstructed.

The **Visor** is a Character-specific Head Armor that can only be crafted by Wagstaff. It is found in the Tinkering Tab and requires Spectoggles and Cut Stone to craft.

The Visor has a Durability of 600 and absorbs 85% of physical damage. They also reduce vision to a smaller rectangle, but for Wagstaff they remove blurriness. For other characters beside Wagstaff, their vision will be compromised by both the rectangle and blurriness, but they can still benefit from the damage absorption. They can be given to a Pig or Bunnyman to wear, which will provide them with the damage absorption effect.

Since Visor's durability only decreases when taking damage, it can be used to negate Wagstaff's blurry view as long as the player avoids taking damage while wearing it.

## Scrapbook Info
When the fuel reaches 0, its damage drops to 27.

The Alarming Clock is a whip-like weapon exclusive to Wanda. It has increased range like the Tail o' Three Cats or Bull Kelp Stalk. While fueled, it has a base damage of 81.6 and counts as a Shadow Weapon, meaning middle-aged Wanda will do 97.92 damage and old Wanda will do 142.8 damage per hit. It does not break upon reaching 0% durability, instead becoming a non-shadow weapon with a base damage of 27.2 (meaning old Wanda does 13.6 damage per swing) until refueled. It has 96 uses, and can be refueled with Nightmare Fuel to restore 25% of its durability (24 uses).

The Alarming Clock's attack speed is 15% slower than melee weapons, but has 2% more damage per second than the Dark Sword when used by Wanda. However, elderly Wanda's max damage per second is 11% less than mighty Wolfgang with a dark sword, although this is somewhat offset by the Alarming Clock's longer reach.

It requires 3 Time Pieces, 4 Marble, and 8 Nightmare Fuel to craft.

## Tips
- When positioned correctly, the Alarming Clock's longer range can effectively keep Wanda out of attacking range of many bosses.
  - Celestial Champion's third phase's melee attack has a trigger range slightly longer than the Alarming Clock's max range, meaning that when aligned correctly you can practically stunlock the boss.

## Trivia
- When Wanda is in the different age phases, the Alarming Clock will have corresponding

# Directional Sign

![Directional Sign](https://path.to/Directional Sign Build.png)

The **Directional Sign** is a craftable **Structure** in **Don't Starve Together**. It can be written on, and it shows up on the **map** like a regular **Sign**. Unlike the normal sign, and indeed almost every other entity, the sign's orientation is not fixed relative to the camera. When built, the sign points to the right, and will remain pointing that direction.

## Crafting
- **Tool**: Can be **Hammered** ![Hammer](https://path.to/Hammer_32.png)
- **Burnable**: Yes
- **Description**: Point fingers at the world. Or signs.
- **Spawn Code**: "arrowsign_post"
- **Ingredients**:
  - **Boards**: 1
- **Filters**:
  - ![Decorations Filter](https://path.to/Decorations_32.png)
  - ![Structures Filter](https://path.to/Structures_32.png)
- **Tier**: 1

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "It says 'Thataway'."
- **Willow**: "Less reading! More burning!"
- **Wolfgang**: "Is no time for reading signs!"
- **Wendy**: "A mark is made, however transient."
- **WX-78**: '"THATAWAY"'
- **Wickerbottom**: "A navigational aid. 'Thataway'."
- **Woodie**: "Let the wood guide the way."
- **Maxwell**: '"Thataway"... Ugh!'
- **Wigfrid**: "A most well-placed sign."
- **Webber**: "We could write on that if only we had a pen!"
- **Winona**: "I'll take this as a sign."
- **Warly**: "This must be a sign."
- **Wortox**: "Nothing to be seen here, I fear."
- **Wormwood**: "Pointy friend"
- **Wurt**: "What it say?"
- **Walter**: "Someone has bad handwriting."
- **Wanda**: "That must be some kind of sign."

## Trivia
- Despite the fact that the **Savanna** biome is coded by that name, the Directional Sign uses the alternative spelling: "Savannah".
- There appears to be a running joke with Directional Signs, as most of the character quotes for blank and burnt signs reference "Thataway" in some form.

## Bugs
- If the player comes by a Directional Sign, rotates the camera while it is off-screen, then returns to it, the sign will point to the wrong way. Rotating the camera while it is on-screen fixes this.

## Scrapbook_Info
- Damage from Shadow Planar damage weapons will ramp up with consecutive hits if you can keep attacking. Getting hit will break this damage chain.

The Void Cowl is a craftable head slot [[Armor]] exclusive to [[Don't Starve Together]], introduced in [[From Beyond]]. It can only be crafted while next to the [[Shadowcraft Plinth]], requiring 4 [[Pure Horror]] and 2 [[Dark Tatters]] to craft.

The Void Cowl has a [[Durability]] of 830. It absorbs 80% of received physical damage and 10 flat received [[Planar Damage]].

An extra 10% protection is added ''after'' the initial 80% (total 82%) to physical protection from [[Shadow Aligned]] creatures. When combined with the [[Void Robe]], the total physical damage protection against Shadow Aligned creatures increases to 85%, as the extra protection added after the initial 80% becomes 25% instead of 10%.

Additionally, 10% Planar Protection is added ''before'' the flat Planar Defense against Shadow Aligned creatures. When combined with the Void Robe, this bonus becomes 25%; while combined with the [[Dreadstone Armor]], it becomes 20%. This manner of protection is much more effective than the physical damage counterpart.

The Void Cowl can be used to increase the [[Shadow Reaper]] and [[Shadow Maul]]'s damage while equipped. Initially, physical damage is increased by 10% and planar damage is increased by 5. It also increases damage by accumulating 4 damage per hit, the maximum being 24 damage, reached after 6 hits. The Void Cowl can also increase the [[Gloomerang]]'s damage. It increases 10% physical damage and 5 planar damage, but consecutive hits will not get more damage. The projectiles also get increased from 3

# Cachebox

## Description

The **Cachebox** is an object that can only be found by **Winona** with the **Founder's Keepers I** skill and **Inspectacles** equipped. While equipping Inspectacles, the player will see blue radio waves on the borders of the screen. The Waves show the direction where the Cachebox is. It can spawn in broken or fixed form. After repairing or opening a Cachebox, it will drop **Scrap**s, **Electrical Doodad**, **Doohickey** and **Calibrated Perceiver**. Doohickey is required to craft **W.I.N.bot**.

After opening a Cachebox, a new Cachebox will appear after half a day. 

Cacheboxes will not appear in Caves.

## Appearance

![Broken](Cachebox Broken.png) ![Fixed](Cachebox.png)

## Quotes

- "Sure hope the bossman doesn't mind me borrowing a few things." - Winona (Cachebox)

## Advanced Cachebox

The **Advanced Cacheboxes** can be found instead of Cacheboxes with 25% chance when Winona has **Founder's Keepers II** skill. The Advanced Cacheboxes can also be found in broken or fixed form. Opening the Advanced Cacheboxes will drop **Scrap**s, **Electrical Doodad**, **Gizmo**, and **Unstable Transmission**.

Unstable Transmission can be used to unlock **Teletransport Station** and **Portasol**.

## Repairing Cachebox

When Winona clicks on a broken Cachebox or Advanced Cachebox while wearing **Inspectacles** (or clicks on Inspectacles icon when near one of the cacheboxes), a puzzle will appear. To solve the puzzle, you need to connect all the parts so that there is no bare wire left. To do this, the player can click on the parts to rotate them clockwise. Once all the wires are connected, the Cachebox will open and drop the loot.

![A puzzle](Screen Repairing Cachebox.png) ![A complete puzzle](Screen Repairing Cachebox2.png)

## Tips

- They are a great source of **Electrical Doodads** and **Scrap**s for Winona's gadgets.

Watch Towers can be built by the player if they are holding a Key to the City. They cannot be set on fire. Royal Guard respawns after 3 days if killed.

## Tips
- **Tip**: If one wants Royal Guards around in a vanilla Don't Starve or Reign Of Giants world, at least one Halberd should be brought through the Skyworthy alongside the Key to the City. Further Halberds can be obtained by spawning and killing Royal Guards or buying them from The Boar's Tusk Weapon Shop.

# The Gorge Event

In the **Don't Starve Together** event, **The Gorge**, players need to cook to earn Maw's favor. It's not as simple as in a regular game; you can't just throw random ingredients into a cauldron and wait for the dish to cook itself. Initially, you need to buy kitchen sets from Mamzi, which contain various cooking stations.

## Pot Hanger

![Pot Hanger Build](Pot_Hanger_Build.png)
- **Name**: Pot Hanger
- **Dropped By**: [Cookpot Kit](Cookpot Kit)

The **Pot Hanger** is a station dropped by the **Cookpot Kit**. Once planted over a fire pit, it functions as a structure where you can hang a cauldron, a large cauldron, or a syrup cauldron. If Wilson is standing next to the hanger while something is being cooked, the cooking efficiency improves.

## Oven

![Oven Build](Oven Build.png)
- **Name**: Oven
- **Dropped By**: [Oven Kit](Oven Kit)

The **Oven** is a station that drops from the **Oven Kit**. Once planted over a fire pit, it functions as a structure where you can put a small or large brazier in it. If Wolfgang is standing next to the oven in which something is being cooked, the cooking efficiency improves.

## Small Grill

![Small Grill Build](Small Grill Build.png)
- **Name**: Small Grill
- **Dropped By**: [Grill Kit](Small Grill Kit)

The **Small Grill** is a station that drops from the **Grill Kit**. Once planted over a fire pit, it functions as a structure. Unlike a boiler and stove hanger, it does not require any additional containers for cooking; the grill itself is a container. To start cooking, you need to put the ingredients into the grill and make a fire.

The grill is for frying. Various burgers, steaks, etc., are cooked on the grill. The small grill has 3 slots for ingredients. If Wendy is standing next to the grill where something is being cooked, the cooking efficiency improves.

If something is on the grill while the fire is burning, the ingredients inside it will slowly fry. The cooking time depends on the intensity of the fire in the fire pit and whether Wendy is standing next to the grill. If the ingredients inside the grill match one of the recipes, steam will come out of the grill, signaling that the dish is ready. However, if you overcook the finished dish on the fire, smoke starts to come out of the grill, and instead of a good dish, you get a burnt dish. Also, a burnt dish is obtained if the fried ingredients inside the grill do not fit any of the recipes.

## Large Grill

![Large Grill Build](Large Grill Build.png)
- **Name**: Large Grill
- **Dropped By**: [Large Grill Kit](Large Grill Kit)

The **Large Grill** is an improved version of the **Small Grill**: it has 4 cells instead of 3, which allows you to cook more complex dishes. Wendy also increases the cooking efficiency of the large grill by standing next to it. Unlike other large containers (large cauldron, large brazier), a large grill can only be obtained through trade with Pipton, in a large grill kit.

Otherwise, the characteristics of the large grill are similar to those of the small grill.

# Crop Seeds

Crop Seeds are a specialized version of **Seeds**, used primarily for **Farming**. When planted in a **Basic**/**Improved Farm**, they produce the crop they are named after (for example, Carrot Seeds produce **Carrots**).

## Obtaining Crop Seeds

Crop Seeds can be obtained by feeding a **Bird** imprisoned in a **Birdcage** any raw Crop from Farm Plots (except **Berries** and **Mandrake**, which do not have Seeds). The Bird will drop 1–2 Crop Seeds per Crop fed, plus a 50% chance for 1 regular Seeds. Birds will not eat Crop Seeds.

When eaten, Crop Seeds provide 0.5 **Health** and 9.375 **Hunger**. Like regular Seeds, Crop Seeds spoil in 40 days, and they turn into **Toasted Seeds** when cooked.

## Downloadable Content

- In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, friendly **Catcoons** may puke Crop Seeds.

It can then be crafted using 2 Red Gems, 10 Charcoal and 1 Scales. The Furnace provides heat in a wide radius (which can quickly overheat the player), and light in a very small radius, and allows the player to cook Food. Currently, this structure affects the player in the same way as the Magma Pools found in the Desert biome, except it won't set the player on fire. The heat from a Scaled Furnace radiates heat 2 tiles as opposed to a single tile from a Campfire or Endothermic Fire (pit or non-pit versions).

It also has 4 slots in which you can put almost any item. Doing this will destroy the item. You cannot use it as storage. If you put a living creature there and destroy it, you will receive some points of naughtiness. Also burning a creature or Living Log will cause them to scream. You can also put Thermal Stone there and wait a bit. In this case, the Thermal Stone will heat up.

### Skins
- **Woven - Elegant Clawfoot Furnace** skin was introduced during the official Year of the Carrat event in 2020.
- **Loyal Crystalline Furnace** skin was a Twitch Drops and was awarded for watching 6 hours of Don't Starve Together on Twitch from May 28, 2020 to June 15, 2020. It is also available in the Klei Rewards shop for 1,200 Klei points.

### Tips
- Placing Thermal Stones next to the Scaled Furnace is a great way to heat them up efficiently, as no fuel is needed for the Scaled Furnace.
- A fully fueled Campfire will heat a thermal stone hotter than the Scaled Furnace.
  - However, 2 Scaled Furnaces next to each other will heat a thermal stone better than a Campfire.

### Trivia
- The Scaled Furnace was added in the Warts and All update.
- In the Rhymes with Play stream it was revealed on, it was accidentally read as "Salad Furnace". "saladfurnace" has been added alongside it as an easter egg, and is in fact just a green reskin of the Scaled Furnace.

- Choose: Willow

### Description
Broken Clockworks are naturally spawning Structures that appear in the Ruins. The player can use 3 Gears to repair the Clockworks and spawn an allied chess piece, or destroy it with a Hammer.

In either case, a pile will drop the following loot:
- Frazzled Wires (1 + 55% chance of 2nd one)
- Gears (25% + 10% of 2nd if the pile was repaired)
- Melty Marbles (25%)
- Gems (5% for each of Red, Purple, Yellow, Orange, and Green)
- Thulecite (1% + 5% of 2nd if repaired)

Repairing will cause two rolls of the loot table, doubling the loot gained overall in exchange for the gears spent.

Taking into account the gear drops, the cost to repair each clockwork pile is 2.65 gears.

When hammered, there also exists a 10% chance that Lightning will strike and spawn a hostile Damaged Knight, Damaged Rook, or Damaged Bishop.

### Types of Broken Clockworks
| Type | Damaged Knight | Damaged Bishop | Damaged Rook |
|------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Type 1 | 50% | 50% | 0% |
| Type 2 | 70% | 0% | 30% |
| Type 3 | 0% | 70% | 30% |

### Trivia
- Repaired Clockwork Monsters will be allied, although they will turn hostile if struck with Lightning.
- Each type of Broken Clockworks is made up of jumbled-up parts of the chess pieces that type can spawn.

### Bugs
- Allied chess pieces spawned from Broken Clockworks are hostile towards Chester.
- In Don't Starve Together, the pieces are hostile towards Hutch and other players.

- **Choose**: Willow

A **Doydoy Nest** is a craftable [[Survival Tab]] [[Structure]] introduced in the ''[[Shipwrecked]]'' DLC. It requires 8 [[Twigs]], 2 [[Doydoy Feather]]s and 4 [[Manure]] to craft, and an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype. A Doydoy Nest crafted by the player will be empty; only a Nest spawned by two [[Doydoy]]s mating will contain a [[Doydoy Egg]] upon creation.

A Doydoy Egg inside the Nest will hatch into a [[Doydoy#Baby Doydoy|Baby Doydoy]] after 2 [[Day]]s. Upon hatching, the Nest will disappear. The Egg can be harvested from the Nest at any time. Unlike [[Tallbird]]s, Doydoys do not chase the player if the Egg is taken. Empty Doydoy Nests are ignored by Doydoys, and no new Egg will spawn in them automatically. However, players can place a Doydoy Egg in an empty Nest which will then hatch.

Two Doydoy Eggs and four Doydoy Feathers are required to restore Doydoy population from complete extinction, allowing players to craft two Doydoy Nests and place a Doydoy Egg in each.

### Trivia
- The crafting description ("Just doy it.") may be a pun on [[Wikipedia:Nike,_Inc.|Nike's]] slogan "Just Do It".

- Wilson: "Home sweet home."
- Willow: "I wonder how long before it burns down."
- Wolfgang: "Is mighty Wolfgang house!"
- Wendy: "Why bother with a permanent home?"
- WX-78: "HOUSING UNIT FOR A WX-78"

- Woodlegs: "Ol' Woodlegs prefers tha'seas."
- Wilba: "TO MINE OWN HOUSE BE TRUE"
- Wormwood: "Home"
- Wheeler: "I'm excited about the extra storage space!"
- Choose: Webber

## Interior

Upon unlocking and entering the Shanty, the player is greeted with two **Charcoal** scattered on the floor. The default interior consists of Wood Paneling and Flooring, a Cinderblock Bookshelf, a Tasteful Fish Mounting, and a Rope Light. The interior and exterior can be renovated and replaced with the **Renovate Tab**.

## Tips

- The Slanty Shanty makes for a good base, given that most utility structures can be placed inside and it can be expanded infinitely using **House Expansion Permit**s and **Doors Tab** doors, as well as having protection from most outside elements.
- If the house catches on fire or is destroyed, nearby **Worker Pig Workers** or even the player can rebuild it with a **Hammer**. The player's items inside will not be lost. The only way to destroy the house is by using the **Executive Hammer** or a **Deconstruction Staff**.
- There is a major sanity aura when inside the house. It may be stacked with the sanity aura of a recruited **Royal Guard**.
- Even if the House protects the player from most environmental hazards, it does not protect them from **Hay Fever**, **Freezing**, and **Overheating**.
- Even if the player hasn't yet bought a Deed of home ownership yet, it is best to prepare for once the player does buy it by planting **Farm**s, a **Crock Pot**, **Evergreen** and **Birchnut Tree**Birchnut trees, and **Berry Bushes** for income from **Pig Traders/Usher**Ushers.

## Bugs

- Entering another room while an item is on fire will not spawn **Ash**.
- Entering another room while a **Chest** catches on fire will delete all items in the Chest, including ones that are unrenewable.

## Trivia

- The Slanty Shanty can also be crafted using 3 **Tenpiece Oinc**s or 1 **Centapiece Oinc**. If using Centapiece Oinc, one will be returned 7 Tenpiece Oincs.

### Description
The Thumper is a Character-specific Structure craftable only by Wagstaff. It is found in the Tinkering Tab and requires 1 Gears, six Flint, and two Hammers to craft.

The Thumper can be used to destroy nearby Structures, boulders, Trees, and uproots plants by creating a shockwave when activated. If the Thumper hits a player or Mob, it will do 30 Hps in damage.

Thumper's destruction radius is 9 units around itself (2.25 tiles) and damage radius is 5 units (1.25 tiles).

### Tips
- The Thumper is an effective way to indirectly kill neutral mobs, such as Beefalo, Royal Guards, or even Moslings.
- The Thumper's prominent use is to farm trees by planting a bunch of them near the Thumper, waiting for them to grow, and then activating it to harvest all the trees at once. Notably, Palm Trees cannot be renewably farmed using the Thumper, as the Thumper will halve the Coconuts dropped, rendering them unplantable.
- It can be used by characters other than Wagstaff by placing it as him and switching characters.

### Trivia
- Its design and movement are inspired by the [drinking bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_bird).

# Grass Tufts

## Overview

**Grass Tufts** are common **Plants** found in **Savanna** and **Grasslands**, but they can also appear in other **biomes**. They can also be found in a few **Caves**, notably the **Sunken Forest**.

## Harvesting and Regrowth

Grass can be harvested to receive 1 **Cut Grass**, after which they will need three days to regrow (**Rain** will reduce this time).

Grass can be dug up with a **Shovel** or **Regal Shovel** and replanted in a new location (typically closer to a base camp). Doing this will give it a shorter, withered appearance, requiring the tuft to be **fertilized** before it will regrow any new grass. It must be fertilized again after 20 harvests. Grass will not grow during **Winter**. Grass Tufts can't be planted on **Checkerboard Floorings**, **Wooden Floorings**, **Cobblestones**, **Carpeted Floorings**, **Rocky Turfs**, **Sandy Turfs**, and **Cave Rock Turfs**, unless it has been planted before these **Turf**s were placed.

## Fire and Fertilization

These plants are flammable and can be used as long-lasting fuel in **Campfires** and **Fire Pits**, but that is not recommended since Grass Tufts are a nonrenewable resource. When unpicked Grass Tufts are burned, they will leave behind 1 **Ash** and no plantable tuft. The same applies to dug-up tufts.

Because they burn easily and are usually planted very close together in a large cluster, Grass Tufts are very susceptible to **Lightning** strikes which occur during heavy Rain. This can be prevented by building **Lightning Rods** near them.

Grass Tufts will turn into **Withered Grass Tufts** (with a similar appearance as those that need fertilization) during **Summer**. During this condition, Grass Tufts are unharvestable for their Grass, and digging these will yield 1 Cut Grass and no replantable Tuft. A way of curing or preventing these from withering is to simply apply fertilizers or build an **Ice Flingomatic** nearby.

## Transformation and Renewal

Grass will sometimes transform into living **Grass Gekko**s when being picked.

Grass are renewable in **Endless** and **Wilderness** **Game Modes** through **Resource Renewal**.

## Description
Bramble Blooms are aggressive plants exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. They spawn around Brambles during Lush Season and can be found in the Rainforest, Deep Rainforest, Gas Rainforest, Plains, and Painted biomes. They drop Bramble Bulbs when destroyed. They will not spawn or spread onto all crafted turfs. Due to turf restrictions, they avoid spawning in Lily Pond, Cultivated, and Pig City biomes. A few days after Lush Season has started, Brambles will spawn in random locations, including seven Bramble Blooms. All Bramble Blooms despawn within 0-0.5 days after the end of Lush Season and do not drop any loot.

## Tips
- Normally, only seven Bramble Bulbs can be obtained each year. This limit can be bypassed with the Aporkalypse Calendar. When the Aporkalypse is triggered (naturally or manually), all current Brambles and Bramble Blooms are slated to despawn. Ending the Aporkalypse while it is still Lush Season will spawn new Brambles and seven new Bramble Blooms.
- Bramble Blooms appear as an icon on the player's Map, making them easy to locate.

# Thulecite Medallion

## Overview
The **Thulecite Medallion** is an **Ancient** item. It requires 2 **Nightmare Fuel**, 2 **Thulecite**, and a **Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station** to craft. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, the Thulecite Medallion cannot be prototyped and **Characters** need to be near a Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft it again.

## Description
The medallion changes colors to gauge the state of the **Nightmare Cycle** in the **Ruins**.

- **Calm Phase** - The medallion will be tan.
- **Warning Phase** - The medallion will be tan with red accents.
- **Nightmare Phase** - The medallion will glow red. **Nightmare Lights** will spawn **Shadow Creatures** in this phase.

Examining the item at this time will provide further details regarding the current state of magical flux: *becoming more magical*, *staying steady*, or *becoming less magical*, referring to the start, middle, and end of the Nightmare Phase, respectively.

When outside the Ruins (including in the **Caves**), it will remain a constant red, with the character noting it's not working when it's examined.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: Getting pretty magical around here.
- **Willow**: It's warning me.
- **Wolfgang**: The bad light comes soon.
- **Wendy**: I can feel the prying eyes.
- **WX-78**: CYCLE MINIMUM HAS PASSED
- **Wickerbottom**: There are low, but increasing levels of vapors containing ectoplasmic residue.
- **Woodie**: This thing just turned on!

- **Webber**: Something's brewing.
- **Walani**: Woah! Things are really heating up!
- **Warly**: I feel some magic coming on!
- **Woodlegs**: Somethin' feels off...
- **Wilba**: SOMETHING ROTTEN IN STATE OF WILBA HEAD
- **Wormwood**: Something happening...
- **Wheeler**: Something's happening. I don't know what, but definitely something.
- **Winona**: I feel uneasy for some reason.
- **Wortox**: I'm getting so excited!
- **Wurt**: Getting weird, florp...
- **Walter**: Things are starting to get exciting!
- **Wanda**: Oh no no no, don't you dare!

## Downloadable Content
In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, the Thulecite Medallion can be crafted while wearing a **Brain of Thought**, even when the player is not near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

## Tips
Using a Thulecite Medallion in **Don’t Starve Together** is an excellent way to find the **Ancient Guardian** (if it has not been found/killed yet), as it holds the Ancient Key. It is also a good way to locate the key when the player carrying it has travelled off somewhere too far and can't be found.

# Crock Pot

## Overview
The Crock Pot is a **Structure** used to **Cook** a variety of belly-filling dishes from basic **Food**s. It requires 3 **Cut Stone**, 6 **Charcoal**, 6 **Twigs**, and a **Science Machine** to prototype.

## Usage
A Crock Pot has 4 slots for ingredients, each must be filled with a piece of Food to start cooking. Most recipes take 10–20 seconds to cook. Completed Crock Pot dishes can be stacked to 40; none of them can be used in the Crock Pot again.

### Quotes
- **Wilson**: "It makes me hungry just to look at it."
- **Willow**: "I could put food in it and fire underneath it."
- **Wolfgang**: "Empty pot make Wolfgang think hungry thoughts."
- **Wendy**: "As empty as my soul."
- **WX-78**: "I CAN REFINE MEATS AND VEGETABLES INTO MORE ROBUST FORMS"
- **Wickerbottom**: "It looks derelict when it's not cooking something."
- **Woodie**: "It seems a waste to just leave it sitting there, empty."
- **Maxwell**: "Just the thought makes my mouth water."
- **Wagstaff**: "In need of ingredients."
- **Wigfrid**: "Nöthing in there."
- **Webber**: "Food goes in, other food comes out."
- **Walani**: "My kind of cooking... Just dump everything in and wait!"
- **Warly**: "Empty pot, empty heart."
- **Woodlegs**: "Th'pot be empty."
- **Wilba**: "IT MOCKS WILBA WITH EMPTINESS"
- **Wormwood**: "Nothing there"
- **Wheeler**: "Meals are typically better if they contain food."
- **Winona**: "I make a mean stew."
- **Wortox**: "Can souls simmer?"
- **Wurt**: "Wish there was food inside, flurp."
- **Walter**: "Sure wish there was food in it."
- **Wanda**: "I guess I'll just... find some seeds to eat or something."

## Tips
- The light emitted by an active Crock Pot is enough to keep **Charlie** away.
- **Warly** has his own **Portable Crock Pot**.
- Some Crock Pot dishes give fewer **Hunger** / **Health** points than the sum of their components.
- If the player has enough resources to create a 5-6 fit Crock Pot setting, the player can position them in a quintet or hexagonal style and place a Fridge or two in the center. This will allow both the fridge and crock pot to be open simultaneously, increasing cooking efficiency.
- It's a good idea to cook any stale or spoiled food on fire before putting them in the Crock Pot, if the recipe allows cooked food to be used. Doing so raises the overall freshness of the ingredients, making the end result last longer.

## Skins
- **Heirloom Elegant Creepy Cauldron**: Only obtainable during official **Hallowed Nights** events until 2020.
- **Woven - Elegant Terracotta Cooking Pot**: Introduced during the official **Year of the Carrat** event in 2020.

# Ice Flingomatic

The **Ice Flingomatic** is a **craftable structure** from the **Reign of Giants** DLC. It requires 2 **Gears**, 15 **Ice**, and 2 **Electrical Doodads** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.

## Description

The Ice Flingomatic can be turned on and off by the player. When turned on, it will automatically launch snowballs to extinguish any smoldering objects or **Fires** within its range. This includes **Campfires**, **Fire Pits**, **Night Lights**, and **Endothermic Fires**. It will not target players holding **Torches** (or **Willow's Lighter**).

The Ice Flingomatic has a limited fuel tank, indicated by a red gauge on the front of the unit. A full tank will last 5 **days** and can be refueled with any **fuel** substances, such as **Logs** (9%) or **Rot** (3%), as well as **Nitre** (19%), **Glommer's Goop** (50%). As long as the Ice Flingomatic is turned on, it will consume fuel over time. Extinguishing fires and reviving withered plants do not consume additional fuel.

The Ice Flingomatic will target **Farms** and withered **Berry Bushes**, **Grass Tufts**, and **Saplings**, allowing them to be harvested normally throughout **Summer**.

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: Fling on!
- **Willow**: I wish you'd shut your lid and stop putting out fires.
- **Wolfgang**: I can throw better.
- **Wendy**: I don't know why you bother. We're all going to burn.
- **WX-78**: FRIEND IS WHIRRING
- **Wickerbottom**: Pitch that ice!
- **Woodie**: Save the trees!
- **Maxwell**: Begone, fire!
- **Wigfrid**: Catapult engaged för battle!
- **Webber**: This would come in handy in a snowball fight.
- **Winona**: Witness the efficiency of the future!
- **Walani**: Fling it on!
- **Warly**: Make it snow!
- **Woodlegs**: This area be protected from fires.
- **Wormwood**: Keep fire away
- **Wagstaff**: Primed for fire fighting!
- **Wilba**: TIS FULL
- **Wheeler**: Nothing keeps fire away like chucking pieces of ice at it.
- **Wortox**: It is ready to fling at a moment's notice.
- **Wurt**: Good machine!
- **Walter**: That should keep us from setting the camp on fire... hopefully.
- **Wanda**: It's a good thing we prepared for just such an eventuality.

## Downloadable Content

- In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, the Ice Flingomatic can be **flooded**.
- In the **Hamlet** DLC, **Wormwood** can be frozen by Ice Flingomatics.

## Don't Starve Together

In **Don't Starve Together** (DST), when an Ice Flingomatic is interacted with, instead of being turned off, it will go into "Emergency Mode." In this state, the Ice Flingomatic will be in a similar state to its RoG counterpart when turned off, in that it will not save plants or crops from withering or automatically put out all fires within its range, but if there are 5 "structures" on fire, or a recently burnt "structure" within 3.75 tiles, the machine will sound an alarm, lighting the light bulb on its top and playing a tone. If another 'structure' is burnt within 15 seconds of the alarm sounding, the Ice Flingomatic will turn itself on and attempt to control the fire automatically. "Structure" includes the normal buildings like chest, but also others like planted flower, trees, saplings. The emergency mode switch on will only happen provided the flingomatic has fuel, and is useful for protecting against a total fire destruction, at the cost of some fire damage.

After the fire is controlled, if no more fires are detected for 25 seconds, the Ice Flingomatic will turn itself off again. When automatically responding to an emergency, an Ice Flingomatic cannot be manually turned off once it has been activated. A working Ice Flingomatic can emit enough light to ward off **Charlie**.

The landed snowball provides an effect in 1 tile radius. Each snowball will cool thermal stone by 5 degree, down to -20 degree.

# The First Rule of 'Don't Starve'
The first rule of ''Don't Starve'' is that you cannot survive forever. You will die from something sooner or later. This guide strives to help you to die later.

## Opening Moves

### Your First Day
![Start Guide](Guidestart.jpg)
Collect **grass**, **twigs**, and some **flint**. As soon as you have your first flint, fashion an **axe**. Before nightfall, you should have chopped a tree or three. Pick up more grass and twigs (at least five each), also pick any **berries** and pluck all **carrots** you happen to come across. Also try pick some flowers. Don't stop just because it's getting dark! You can keep at it well into dusk.

### Your First Night
When dusk turns into night, you'll need three grass and two logs to make a fire. Pile on another log, or (at most) two, that will be sufficient to last you until dawn. Time to cook and eat some food (pick it from your inventory and hold it over the fire). Craft a pickaxe. If your light shines far enough, you may chop down trees or mine a rock. However, a better alternative is to use two torches so you can still explore during night. This is also a good time to burn trees for charcoal. You should go down to the caves early on to collect light bulbs so you can craft a lantern, a refuelable light source that can also be dropped while still emitting light.

## The Next Five (or Fifteen) Days
Eventually, you will want to settle down and establish a base camp somewhere. But first, get your bearings. Doubly so if you are a new player. It's easier to learn while exploring, and less frustrating to die before you have settled down and put a lot of effort into building a home. In your first games, you'll not only uncover the map, you discover the game. It is full of surprises, you'll meet lots of unfamiliar creatures and even ones that look familiar may be more dangerous than they seem. Your first few games will probably end in an early and (in hindsight) silly death—do not fear failure! Failure is data. Learn from your mistakes.

A good approach is to walk along the shoreline, that way you will uncover the outline of the map and will get a good idea of the lay of the land, even though substantial black areas remain for now. Gather resources as you go, **but keep going**. You may occasionally even chose to walk through the night by torchlight, though most nights will be spent close to a campfire, cooking, eating, and either crafting or chopping a few trees or mining a rock; try to place the campfire in a place where you can keep busy during the night.

Cooking is important, by the way: most foods will be more nourishing and healthy (or at least less unhealthy) when cooked.

### Other Things You Should Do Early
Pick a total of twelve **flowers** and fashion them into a **garland**. It looks silly, but will prevent you from going insane.

Your first **Science Machine** should be built once you have the necessary material and then some, probably on your third or fourth night. Make a **backpack** and a **shovel**, also learn how to make **boards**, **rope**, and **cut stone**. Don't worry too much about where you build the device; it is comparatively cheap and you can well build another, when you finally know where a good location will be.

### Exploration Goals
You want to locate the **Beefalo** herd, the swamp, at least one place with a lot of rocks to mine, and the sweetwater ponds (the ones with **frogs**). If at all possible, also try to locate the **Pig King**.

### What to Collect and What to Leave Behind
While exploring, you will probably collect more stuff than you can carry, backpack notwithstanding. **Try to save space by refining**: when you want to set up your camp, you can make good use of ropes, cut stones and boards.

**Make caches.** By day five, you will have a good idea which parts of the map are more central, and which are way off at the edge. If you find yourself carrying too much, drop something on the ground on a reasonably accessible place, and mark the spot with a **trap** (traps show up on the map and can serve as ersatz signposts).

A comprehensive list of what to keep and what to stash would be a long discussion; knowing which is needed when comes with experience and is part of learning the game. But as a few rough rules of thumb: You will not need the cut stones or boards until you make camp; and generally

# Food and Gardening Filter

![Tab Icon](Icon Food.png)

> "Do I look like a farmer?" - Maxwell

Food items and structures vary in their necessity. The Crock Pot is suggested to be built as early as possible, often more than one, making it essential. Other items, such as the Ice Box or Drying Rack, greatly assist in survival, making them very useful, though not as essential.

## Downloadable Content

- In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, Bucket-o-poop was introduced to the Food Tab. They are available to craft in all DLCs.
- In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, Mussel Sticks, Mussel Beds, and Fish Farms were added to the Food Tab.
- In **Hamlet**, players can craft Sprinklers in this tab.

## Craftable Items and Structures

The following items and structures can be crafted in the Food Tab:

| ![Basic Farm](Basic Farm.png) | [Basic Farm] | ![Improved Farm](Improved Farm.png) | [Improved Farm] | ![Bee Box](Bee Box.png) | [Bee Box] |
