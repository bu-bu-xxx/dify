# Nautical Tab

![Nautical Icon](Icon Nautical.png){: .thumbnail width="104" height="104"}  
"Quote from Walani: My pride and joy!"

The **Nautical Tab** is a crafting category exclusive to the **Shipwrecked** and **Hamlet** DLCs.  

In **Shipwrecked**, it contains **Boats**, most items related to them, as well as other items and structures that are useful in surviving and farming the **Ocean** biome. Boats are the only way to travel between islands in the world of **Shipwrecked**. The player will start off able to build either a **Raft** or **Log Raft** to get around, unless playing as **Wickerbottom**, **Walani** or **Woodlegs**, as they will have the **Row Boat**, the **Surfboard** or the **The 'Sea Legs'** available to craft right away, respectively.

The more advanced boats have their own equipment slots for a **Sail**, a light source, a **Boat Cannon**, a **Quackering Ram** or a **Trawl Net**. The **Cargo Boat** gives six additional inventory slots, and the **Encrusted Boat** has the most durability out of all available boats. This category also contains all **Dress Tab** items related to boats like the **Pirate Hat** or the **Life Jacket**.

In **Hamlet**, the Tab contains only some of the items available in **Shipwrecked**: Log Rafts, Row Boats, Cargo Boats, Boat Repair Kit and Snakeskin Sails are available to craft, the latter one looking very different. Additionally, the **Cork Bowl Canoe** is added to this tab.

## Craftable Items and Structures

The following items and structures can be crafted in the Nautical Tab:

## Description
The **Poison Spear** is a craftable weapon exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It does the same damage as a **Spear** and **Poisons** the target on hit. Poisoned enemies move slower, attack less often, and deal less damage. However, the food items that drop from poisoned enemies will have their freshness reduced to 50%.

## Tips
- The Poison Spear is a useful melee weapon in killing **Prime Apes** as it slows their movement speed on each hit.
- Because of its ability to slow down and weaken enemies, this weapon is excellent against Bosses like the **Tiger Shark**; or in **Reign of Giants** linked worlds, against the **Dragonfly** due to her fast attack period, making it safer to land a hit and kite while she's poisoned.
- Loaded into a **Spear Gun**, the Poison Spear makes a great first strike against a **Blue Whale**/**White Whale**. The spoilage penalty on loot will not apply and the whale will move and attack much slower.
- The **Sealnado** is not affected by Poison.

## Trivia
- Prior to the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#December 17, 2015 - Hang Ten Update**, the Poison Spear's icon looked just like a regular Spear with its tip being green.
- Like in every other case, crafting does not consider durability of an item, making a 1% Spear just as good as a 100% one, effectively letting the player use a spear almost twice as long.

The Ancient Gateway is an indestructible [Structure](#) exclusive to [Don't Starve Together](#), introduced in [A New Reign](#). It is located in the middle of the [Atrium](#) [Biomes](#).

Its only use is to have an [Ancient Key](#) be placed in its socket, making the Ruin's [Nightmare Cycle](#) be locked at the peak state. It can be removed again, unlocking the Cycle from its peak. If a fully-constructed [Odd Skeleton](#) is revived near an activated Ancient Gateway, the fight against the [Ancient Fuelweaver](#) will begin. The Ancient Fuelweaver can deactivate the Atrium's Nightmare Cycle by removing the Ancient Key. If the Ancient Fuelweaver is killed it will trigger an explosion that will activate after three minutes, renewing the Ruins. Twenty days later, the Gateway will accept the Ancient Key to be placed again.

After the [Reanimated Skeleton](#) is killed, a beckoning hand will spawn, prompting the player to give it 5 [Dreadstone](#). When given the Dreadstone, [Charlie](#) will appear and fix the Ancient Gateway, activating the [Shadow Rift](#) cycle.

In a lore sense, the Ancient Gateway acts as a portal to what are known as Gate Realms. These Gate Realms were the settings for special limited-time [Events](#).

The repaired gate can be spawned via the console with the following command:

c_spawn("atrium_gate").AnimState:AddOverrideBuild("atrium_gate_build")

## Town Houses Details
The player can also craft their own Town Houses using the **Key to the City** and its **City Planning** crafting tab, using four **Boards**, three **Cut Stone**, and four **Pig Skin**. When crafted, the house will have a random appearance from a selection of appearances. If the player builds a **My City Hall** in addition to a Town House, the Pig that owns the house will periodically pay the player taxes. See **My City Hall** for more info.

Each town house will spawn a random Pig Trader when first built. The style of the house does not affect the Pig Trader spawned, and each outcome is equally likely. Any time that the Pig Trader who owns the house dies, another Pig Trader of the same type will respawn after three days.

Should the Town House be hammered down or burnt, then the Town House can be rebuilt with a hammer. In order to permanently destroy a Town House and regain half the spent materials, one must use the **Executive Hammer**.

## Tips
* If one wants to build a Pig City in a vanilla **Don't Starve** or **Reign Of Giants** world, one will need to bring the **Key to the City** through the **Skyworthy** and start by building these houses. As **Werepigs** are an easy source of **Pig Skin**, it shouldn't be long until the player has enough houses to get a healthy income from the Traders.

When fed to a vegetable-eating creature, such as a Pig, Werepig, or Beefalo, it will cause it to start panicking and dropping Manure while taking damage every 3 seconds. The effect lasts for 45 seconds, dealing a total of 75 damage (95 including base damage) and dropping 15 Manure (or 1 extra if the creature drops Manure when fed). If eaten by another player, it will have no effect other than the base stats.

## Trivia
- The Syrup of Ipecaca was introduced in the Skill Spotlight: Wormwood, Wolfgang, Woodie update.
- The name of this item is a portmanteau of Syrup of Ipecac and the Spanish word "caca," meaning poop.

# Dumbbells

Dumbbells are items which can only be crafted by **Wolfgang** and can only be held by him. They can be used as weapons or can be lifted to fill up Wolfgang's **Mightiness Meter** each time he lifts them, depending on his current strength and the Dumbbell he uses. Wolfgang does 1 lift per second. Attacking using a Dumbbell will have the effects as lifting it 0.5 times, and Mighty Wolfgang can throw the Dumbbells, causing damage to targets in a small radius. Throwing damage equals to 2x melee attack damage. Melee attacking costs 2 uses of the Dumbbell, and throwing cost 10 uses.

When Wolfgang moves while holding Dumbbells on hand, his mightiness will not decrease.

**Guano Turf** is a [[Turf]] item. It can be found on [[Stalagmite Terrain]] and in the [[Rocky Plains]] [[Biomes|Biome]], inside [[Caves]] where [[Batilisk]]s roam. Guano Turf can be acquired by digging it up with a [[Pitchfork]]. It can then be placed on any bare ground tile or used as [[Fire#Fuel|fuel]].

Plants like [[Berry Bush]]es, [[Grass Tuft]]s, [[Saplings]], [[Spiky Bush]]es, [[Lureplant]]s, [[Pine Cone]]s, and [[Birchnut]]s can be planted on these Turfs. It will not stop the Lureplants' [[Lureplant#Eyeplant|Eyeplants]] from spawning.

When placed on the [[Surface World]] covering a large enough area, Crows are the only [[Birds]] that will spawn and land on these turfs.

When brought to SW, [[Flooding|Floods]] can spawn on this turf.

## Tips

- A Moon Stone with a Moon Caller's Staff will emit light and drain heat, acting as a permanent stationary Polar Light.
- The transformation can be carried out without combat if access to the stone is blocked with walls thick enough to withstand the onslaught.
- Removing the Star Caller's Staff before the transformation completes allows farming Moon Rocks without consuming the staff.

## Trivia

- The Moon Stone event triggers its own music, hearable by all players involved.
- Moon Stone and Moon Rubble were added in the ''A Little Fixer Upper'' update.
- The Moon stone actually accepts any of the staves with a gem, but only the star- and moon-caller's staves have any effect.
- If a [[Dress Tab|Hat]] is placed upon a [[Pig/Normal|Pig]] and it becomes a [[Pig/Werepig|Werepig]], the [[Dress Tab|Hat]] will disappear once the Moon Stone event is triggered.

## Trivia
- Before they were implemented, Thulecite Walls had a grayish color instead of the current golden one.
- Since Thulecite Walls only take one Thulecite to build and each wall drops Thulecite Fragments when hammered, the player can make the walls, hammer them down when they get useless, and still craft the original Thulecite back as long as they place the walls separately or don't combine any of them. This also applies to stone walls, but only in multiples of six (6 stone is required to craft 6 stone walls).

## Skins
- **Woven - Elegant Victorian Thulecite Wall:** Introduced during the official Year of the Beefalo event in 2021.
- **Timeless Ancient Ornamental Wall / Loyal Ancient Ornamental Wall:** Originally introduced between October 22, 2020, the release day of the Return of Them update, and November 26, 2020. As of March 24, 2022, the Loyal version of this skin was available in the Klei Rewards shop for 1,200 Klei Points.

# Elephant Cactus

The `Elephant Cactus` is a [Plant] introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC and is found in the **Volcano**. It is active during the **Dry Season**. When approached, the cactus fires its spikes as an Area of Effect (AoE) attack dealing 20 damage to all [Mobs] in range (about 1 [Turf] tile). Each time the cactus is attacked, it deals 10 damage to the attacker. While wearing [Cactus Armor], players are immune to the AoE attack and will not be targeted, however damage will still be taken from attacking the cactus with a Melee Weapon.

## Behavior

When killed, the Elephant Cactus shrinks into a stump and drops a [Cactus Spike]. It can then be dug up with a [Shovel] and replanted in a new location. Replanting during Dry Season spawns an active cactus; Replanting at any other time spawns a withered cactus, which can be fertilized with [Ashes]. Digging up a withered Elephant Cactus will yield two [Twigs]. The cactus can be only planted on [Magma Turf], [Ashy Turf], or [Volcano Turf].

When entering [Mild Season] from Dry Season, an active Elephant Cactus will possibly wither. When returning to Dry Season, both a withered cactus and a cactus stump will grow into an active cactus.

Elephant Cacti are nonflammable when planted or as an item on the ground, although they still take fire damage and can still be used as fuel. However, using them as fuel is ill advised, since they are relatively rare and are nonrenewable.

## Usage

Withered Elephant Cacti can be planted close enough together to block the movement of [Mobs] and the player. Since they cannot be killed in this form, they can be used as indestructible [Walls]. The [Bearger]'s or [Tiger Shark]'s pound attacks will uproot them though. They are excellent for farming almost any mobs and for building defenses due to their AoE damage, ability to be replanted, and associated armor (rendering the cacti harmless). Possible uses include:

* Planted around a [Bee Box] to easily gather [Stinger]s and occasionally [Honey].
* Surrounding a [Powdercake] with four cacti will make an easy farm for [Gobbler]s, [Rabbit]s, [Crabbit]s, [Pig]s, [Wildbore]s and anything attracted to the bait.
* [Flowers] can be planted around them to farm [Butterfly Wings] and [Butter].
* Dropping seeds around them and wearing a [Feather Hat] is a good way to farm [Birds] for their drops. However, since the AoE damage is lower than a [bird]'s health, when hit by the attack it is stunned, allowing it to be picked up; if the bird is not collected quickly it will be killed by the cactus.
* A grid of planted Elephant Cactic can be used as a defense against periodic [Crocodog] attacks.
* Farm [Spiders] although they need to be planted at least 2.5 Tiles away from the [Spider Den] to avoid destroying the den.
* Surrounding [Dragoon Dens] with many Elephant Cacti is a good way to farm [Dragoon Heart]s and [Monster Meat] from [Dragoon]s.
* Cacti planted near [Snake Den]s will kill Snakes for [Monster Meat], [Snakeskin] and [Venom Gland]s.

## Tips

* While Elephant Cacti do not burn, they still do take fire damage. Therefore when used against hounds, an [Ice Flingomatic] nearby is recommended to keep them safe from the fire of dead Red Hounds.
* An easy way to collect an Elephant Cactus is to dig up 4 nearby [Turfs] with a [Pitchfork] and place them (separately, not stacked) on the ground next to it and light them on fire. Seven twigs can also be used for this. The cactus will die to the fire damage and the spike and stump can be collected. For inactive cacti, these can be placed before fertilizing it but should be ignited after the cactus is fertilized. For an active cactus, wearing a [Cactus Armor] is recommended to avoid the damage. More Turfs may be needed if they were not placed close enough to the cactus.
* After they have been planted, players can use a [Pitchfork] to change the turf under them without the cactus

## Wood Fences Description

Wood Fences are wall-like Structures located in the Structures Tab. 3 Twigs and 1 Rope are required to craft 6 Wood Fences. They are flammable and can be destroyed with a Hammer or any weapon. Together with Wood Gates, they can be used both for decorative uses and for making a cage for a Mob. However, flying Mobs cannot be trapped using Wood Fences, as they will simply fly over it.

Fences seem to try to connect to adjacent fences, and rotate by a 45 degree angle every time. This allows for more practical placement.

- **Antique Brass Fence**
- **Antique Bronze Fence**

## Trivia

- Wood Fences were introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Cute Fuzzy Animals update during A New Reign. They were later added to Don't Starve in the Quality of Life update.
- Willow's quote for the wood fence is likely a reference to the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
- It is the first stackable item to get a Skin.
  - Skinned fences and not skinned ones do not stack in the Inventory.

# Seaworthy

The Seaworthy is a **Structure** that connects the **Surface World** and the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** world of the **The Constant**, or as the structure itself refers to, the "Desolate Forest" and the "Tropical Paradise". It behaves similarly to **Sinkholes**.

## Shipwrecked
In the **Shipwrecked** world, the player can find the Seaworthy already generated. It is found on an island generally far away from the center of the world. It's generated on the center of a square of four **Wooden Flooring**, with a single **Skeleton** nearby. It can be destroyed with a **Hammer** or **Deconstruction Staff**, yielding a **Sea Worther** **Trinket** which can be used to craft it again elsewhere.

## Outside of Shipwrecked
In order for the Seaworthy to function in a vanilla or **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** world that has not been merged, the option to be compatible with **Shipwrecked** has to be used, which can be done when initially creating said world.

In the Surface World, the Seaworthy does not naturally generate. In order to go to the **Shipwrecked** world, it must be prototyped using a **Shadow Manipulator**, under the **Magic Tab**. Doing so requires a Sea Worther, four **Nightmare Fuel** and four **Living Logs**. Traveling from the SW world to the Surface World does not come with a pre-crafted Seaworthy.

As the Sea Worther can be obtained from **Hammer**ing the **Sunken Boat**, or as a low 4.36% chance drop from fishing up the nearby **Flotsam**, it is theoretically possible to craft multiple Seaworthys in the Surface World, provided the player used the **Wooden Thing** multiple times to farm Sea Worthers or is lucky with Flotsam. The Seaworthy can also be placed in the **Caves** and the **Ruins**. Traveling to the **Shipwrecked** world will function normally, however returning to the Caves or Ruins will have the player enter the Surface World, near the associated Sinkhole. With travel distance between the Sinkhole and the Ruins in mind, it is therefore not recommended to place the Seaworthy in the Ruins.

## Mechanics
When the Seaworthy is first used in either world, an option is given to create a new version of the other world. Another option given is to select an already existing, unmerged save file that features the other world. When save files are merged, the character that used the Seaworthy becomes the main character. Items that the owner of the previous file had in their inventory are stored in a **Grave** that can be dug up.

Followers cannot travel between the two worlds (including **Abigail**). Any unique character-specific items (Like **Lucy the Axe** or **Willow's Lighter**) will be replaced if it does not exist in the destination world. In addition to this, if one merges worlds with an already-existing save, unique character-specific items from the old character will disappear from the save entirely. This is likely to prevent players from obtaining these items with other characters.

Since Seasons pass by normally in the linked worlds, one can use Seaworthy to skip Seasons if they so wish by simply going through the portal and waiting in the other world. For example, if **Dry Season** were to start in a **Shipwrecked** world, the player could gather their things and go to their RoG/base game world until it has passed, provided the Season there is preferable. It should be noted that the two worlds do not necessarily have similar Seasons. For example, it can be **Winter** in a RoG world, but **Monsoon Season** in the SW world. The **Wooden Thing** can be used in either world to force the season to change to the beginning of either Mild Season or Autumn. Through this it is possible to match preferred Seasons.

If the **Wooden Thing|Teleportato** is used in a world, the connected world will not be regenerated along with it. This can allow for indefinite numbers of any non-renewable item by storing them in the other world, and regenerating the world the player wishes to obtain items from.

When two worlds are connected, **Food** Spoilage continues to exist at a normal rate in both worlds.

## Trivia
* In **Don't Starve: Pocket Edition**, the Seaworthy structure spawns as normal, but does not function and cannot be examined. This is probably due to the fact that the **Shipwrecked** DLC is its own app.
* The option to destroy the naturally spawned Seaworthy in **Shipwrecked** worlds was introduced during the development of the **Don

## Mussels
Mussels are naturally spawning objects introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They appear as clusters of three oval shadows in the **Shallow Ocean** that the player can move towards in a **Boat**. In order to harvest them, the player can craft a **Mussel Stick** and wait a minimum of one day, then the Mussel Stick will be coated in Mussels. When harvested, this results in one, three, or six Mussels, depending on how long the player left the stick in the Mussel Bed. The Mussel Bed and stick are consumed by this.

Alternatively, the player can sail over the Mussel Bed using a **Trawl Net** attached to the boat. This will consume the Mussel Bed and place 1 Mussel in the Trawl Net.

New Mussels will spawn randomly to replace those consumed. They can also be planted by the player by crafting a Mussel Bed.

- Choose: Maxwell

The Great Tree Trunk is an indestructible Plant object exclusive to Don't Starve Together and introduced in the Waterlogged beta. They can be rammed into with a boat to drop Cut Grass, Twigs, and a Knobbly Tree Nut, it takes about one day to regrow a new Knobbly Tree Nut. Ramming into the trunk will also alert any nearby Sea Striders, causing them to emerge from their Sea Strider Nests to investigate.

Each Great Tree Trunk will extend a circular canopy over a large area around them. The shade from the canopy protects objects under it from wildfires in the Summer, reduces 35% Wetness from Rain, and mitigates Overheating (180). If Lightning strikes an area under the canopy it will be blocked and some items will fall from the canopy instead.

Grass Gators will fall from the canopy on occasion, with up to one Gator spawning per trunk.

If less than 10 Fireflies are under the canopy, there is a 70% chance one firefly will spawn per day.

# Weeds

**Weeds** are objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in **Return of Them**. They interfere with the farming of **Farm Plants**, but they also have some benefits. Weeds can be removed with a **Shovel** or by burning them.

## Spawning

There are 4 types of Weeds: **Forget-Me-Lots**, **Fire Nettles**, **Tillweed**, and **Spiny Bindweed**. A planted regular **Seed** has a 20% chance to grow into a weed, with a 77% chance to become a Forget-Me-Lots and a 7.7% chance to become a Fire Nettle, a Tillweed, or a Spiny Bindweed.

At the beginning of **Spring**, each **Farm Soil Tile** has a 15% chance to grow a weed. The weed will appear randomly in the first quarter of the season. The same process happens in **Autumn** with a 5% chance.

At the final stage, after 6 to 8 days (3 to 5 for Forget-Me-Lots), the weed will spawn a new weed of the same type within a radius from 1.5 to 10 units with a preference for farm soil. Then, every 12 to 14 days (6 to 8 days for Forget-Me-Lots) the weed attempts a new spread.

A **Fruit Fly** plants new weeds on all unused farm soil in its sight.

## Growth

Fire Nettles, Tillweed, and Spiny Bindweed have 3 growing stages. Forget-Me-Lots have an additional stage called Bolting.

| Plant | Spiny Bindweed | Tillweed | Fire Nettles | Forget-Me-Lots Plant |
|-------|---------------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Seeds | 0.75 - 1      |         |            | 0.75 - 1            |
| Small | 1.2 - 1.8     | 1.2 - 1.8| 1.2 - 1.8   | 0.6 - 0.9           |
| Medium| 0.8 - 1.2     | 0.8 - 1.2| 0.8 - 1.2   | 0.6 - 0.9           |
| Full  | Ever         | Ever    | Ever        | 0.8 - 1.2           |
| Bolting| -           | -       | -           | Ever                |

At the full stage, Fire Nettles, Tillweed, and Forget-Me-Lots can be harvested. If so, they return to the beginning of the small stage and grow again. If Forget-Me-Lots is allowed to grow into its bolting stage it can no longer be harvested.

Growth times are not affected by the season or **Nutrients**. Weeds consume 2 of each nutrient at each stage of their growth and they produce no nutrients in return.

| Plant | Name | Product | Nutrient |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| ![Forget-Me-Lots Plant] | Forget-Me-Lots | ![Forget-Me-Lots] | -2 |
| ![Fire Nettles] | Fire Nettles | ![Fire Nettle Fronds] | -2 |
| ![Tillweed] | Tillweed | ![Tillweeds] | -2 |
| ![Spiny Bindweed] | Spiny Bindweed | - | -2 |

## Forget-Me-Lots

Forget-Me-Lots spread rapidly. When a **Forget-Me-Lots** is dug up, there is a chance for a new Forget-Me-Lots to grow in a nearby tile after 2 to 5 days. The chance depends on the number of other Forget-Me-Lots present; there is a 75% chance of it respawning if the plant is alone, 50% if there is another one within a 3 tile radius, 25% if there are two others, and 0% for 3 or more. Burning this weed will prevent regrowth. In **Don't Starve Together**, burning one crop tends to burn them all and possibly your base as well, so don't try that without adequate ice flingomatic coverage or similar fire suppression.

## Fire Nettles

Fire Nettles have the perk of Overheating players. A player that comes into contact with **Fire Nettles** receives 3 damage and their perceived temperature is increased by 60° for 1 minute, making the player subject to **Overheating**. **Wormwood** is immune to this effect. They can be weeded out using the Shovel.

## Tillweed

Tillweed has the perk of spawning **Garden Detritus**

# Ponds

Ponds are small bodies of water that usually spawn in **Grasslands**, **Forests**, **Marshes**, and **Ruins**.

## Types of Ponds
There are three types of Ponds: purple, green, and blue. 
- Purple Ponds appear in Marshes and spawn **Mosquitoes** at **dusk and night**.
- Green Ponds appear in Grasslands and Forests and spawn **Frogs** during the day.
- Blue Ponds are found in Ruins and contain **Eels** instead of **Fish**.

## Fishing
Using a **Fishing Rod**, **Fish** (in surface Ponds) or **Eels** (in Ruins Ponds) can be caught at any time of **day**. Fishing takes 4 seconds plus 4 seconds for each missing fish in the pond. All variations of Ponds contain up to 10 fishes/eels, and one fish/eel is regenerated every 160 seconds.

## Frozen Ponds
Ponds will freeze in winter once the temperature is low enough, and when frozen, they won't spawn creatures. They also cannot be fished, though they can be walked over.

## Plant
Ponds spawn with 2-4 **Plants** along their banks, which can be examined separately. They cannot be picked, but they can be set on **Fire** to yield **Ashes**. The plants will grow back every **Summer**. Ponds found in the Ruins are surrounded by **Cave Lichen** that resemble **Lichen** instead of the normal plants.

## Tips
- When fishing, be wary of **Frogs** and **Mosquitoes**, as they are aggressive.
- When fishing in a Marsh, note that the Marsh is also the native habitat of **Tentacles** and **Merms**.
- One may fish in Frog Ponds unbothered at dusk when the Frogs return to the water, and in the spring and fall when it is warm enough to thaw the Pond but not warm enough for Frogs to spawn.
- Frog Ponds will sometimes show up in a small cluster. Pig houses can be built near/inside this cluster (preferably walled off) and the frogs will kill any pigs that spawn during the day but will not eat the meat. With this setup, Pig Skin and Meat can be collected regularly at dusk/night.

## Trivia
- Frog Ponds and Mosquito Ponds were added in the **A Little Rain Must Fall** update, while the ones found in the Ruins were added in the **Stuff of Nightmares** update.
- After burning the Plant or Algae, saving and reloading the game will cause them to reappear on the pond.

## Scrapbook Info
The Gloomerang is a ranged weapon that launches three projectiles, dealing more damage the farther they travel. Equipping a Void Cowl gives an additional projectile. The Gloomerang also increases movement speed by 10% when held.

## Description
The Gloomerang is a ranged Weapon item exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in From Beyond. It can be crafted at the Shadowcraft Plinth with 4 Pure Horror and 2 Dark Tatters. When equipped, it gives a 10% speed bonus.

The Gloomerang is a Boomerang type of Weapon, but the player does not need to catch it. It can shoot at max 3 projectiles, or 4 projectiles when a Void Cowl is equipped. Its damage is based on the distance between the player and the target and is decided upon cast. This means that when the target is immobile, even if the player runs further after throwing the Gloomerang, it will not deal more damage than standing still.

The Physical Damage and the Planar Damage of the Gloomerang ranges from 5 to 27.2 depending on the distance. When a Void Cowl is equipped, it deals 10% more Physical Damage and 5 more Planar Damage. At the max range, it deals 54.4 damage in total or 62.12 damage with Void Cowl equipped. Doing consecutive attacks with Void Cowl on will not ramp up to more damage like Shadow Reaper. Additionally, the Gloomerang deals 25% more total damage to Lunar Aligned mobs.

Maxwell with Gloomerang equipped will give Shadow Duelist tier 3 buff.

## Trivia
- Its Scrapbook description from beta was: "A ranged weapon that has 3 projectiles and does damage based on the projectile size./n/nIncreases movement speed by 10% when held."

Lava Pools are created when Dragoon Eggs hit land during Volcano eruptions in the Dry Season of the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. They create light and heat while burning. They can ignite nearby objects and cause Overheating. They can also be used to cook Food items while burning. After burning 75% of the total dusk and night time, they will run out on their own. They cannot be refueled to make them last longer. If they are let to run out, they will drop 2 Rocks, 2 Ashes, and 1 Charcoal. Otherwise, they can be extinguished directly with Ice (but not Hail or other fire extinguishers), and will yield 1 Obsidian instead.

Lava Pools will also be extinguished by Floods or Sprinklers in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC.

## Hamlet

The Root Trunk is a craftable Structure exclusive to the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. It is found in the Magic Tab, requires a Hogus Porkusator to prototype, and a Bramble Bulb, two Flytrap Stalks, and three Boards to craft.

A single Root Trunk functions similar to a Chest, but with 12 storage slots. Items can be stored in a Root Trunk by dragging them onto it or by opening the Root Chest to place them in specific slots.

What makes the Root Trunk special, however, is that it shares its inventory with all other Root Trunks built by the player. Therefore, it is possible to store items in them and transfer them from Root Trunk to Root Trunk instead of carrying them in the player's Inventory.

Unlike regular Chests, Root Trunks do not drop their contents if they are destroyed by Fire, with a Hammer or a Deconstruction Staff. If the last one of them has been destroyed, the items inside them are stored in limbo and can only be accessed again by building another Root Trunk.

Root Trunk can be opened by Pog's.

### Trivia
- Root Trunk was added in the March 18, 2019 update.
- Root Trunk used to require only one Flytrap Stalk to craft, but it was changed in the March 28, 2019 update.
