## Description
Deerclops Eyeball is a food item dropped by the Deerclops. It is similar to a Guardian's Horn, both are dropped by a boss, unable to spoil, and restore health and hunger but decrease sanity. As a meat item, Pigs or Spiders will eat it if left on the ground, and Bunnymen will attack the player on sight if they are carrying it. The eye does not spoil and cannot be cooked.

## Usage
A Deerclops Eyeball can be used as a crafting material for the Houndius Shootius and Eyebrella. It can also be used as emergency food, granting 60 HP, 75 hunger, and draining 15 sanity.

## Crafting Recipes
### Houndius Shootius
- Deerclops Eyeball
- Guardian's Horn
- Thulecite (x5)

### Eyebrella
- Deerclops Eyeball (x1)
- Twigs (x15)
- Bone Shards (x4)

## Tips
- Prioritizing the Eyebrella craft is crucial for survival during the player's first Spring due to frequent rain and lightning strikes.
- It can delay overheating in the first Summer.
- An Eyebrella can last an entire year with little or no repairs.

## Trivia
- The Deerclops Eyeball was added in the "A Winter's Tale" update.
- Shares the same stats with the Guardian's Horn.

# Feathered Reed Tunic

- **Image**: ![Feathered Reed Tunic Dropped](Feathered%20Reed%20Tunic%20Dropped.png)
- **Perk**: +10% movement speed
- **Spawn Code**: `lavaarena_armorlightspeed`

### Exclusivity
Don't Starve Together

### Event
The Forge

The Feathered Reed Tunic is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together. Available immediately from Willow, Wendy, Wes, Wigfried, and Webber. It is armor for the body cell and blocks damage by 60%. It also grants +10% movement speed.

### Tips

- This tunic has one of the lowest damage resistances, so wearers should avoid close contact with Pugna's warriors. However, it offers a bonus to speed, making it suitable for long-range players who prefer to stay away from enemies by shelling them. Therefore, all characters who start the game with a feathered tunic are also equipped with darts.
- Using a tunic in combination with a feather wreath allows you to even run away from a Boarilla!

> "To think they could grow this far out to sea!" - Warly

## Waterlogged
**Waterlogged** is a **Biome** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the **Waterlogged Beta**.

### Features
The Waterlogged Biome generates in the middle of the ocean, usually in Swell & Rough waters, though this is still up for debate. This Biome generates with thick tree trunks that hold up a canopy, known as **Great Tree Trunk**. If the Player(s) ram(s) a boat into a Great Tree Trunk, it will rain **Twigs**, **Cut Grass**, and **Logs**. Players may also find a **Knobbly Tree Nut**, which are attained by underwater salvage after ramming a Great Tree Trunk, using a **Pinchin' Winch**. These seeds can be carried, much like any of the three **Suspicious Marble** pieces. This Knobby Tree Nut can be "re-planted" using the very same **Pinchin' Winch** in any part of the Sea, which will eventually grow an **Above-Average Tree Trunk** anywhere on the water. Hanging in the canopy of the Great Tree Trunks are Hanging **Sea Strider Nests**, which spawn **Sea Striders**, a kind of **Spider** which can walk across the water, and will attack players should they pick the exclusive fruit of the Waterlogged Biome, the **Fig**, off of the Mossy Vines near the dens. When a Vine is picked, it will take 2-3 days to regrow its fruit. Another mob that spawns exclusively in the Waterlogged Biome is the **Grass Gator**, large water-dwelling mobs that act similarly to **Koalefant**, except they can swim in any water and can even go on land to avoid the player. **Fireflies** spawn and regenerate in this biome.

# Red Hound

The Red Hound (also known as Fire Hound, Flame Hound, or Hellhound) can spawn in the Summer and Autumn during Hound attacks and from Hound Mounds. It has the following characteristics:

- **Diet**: Meat
- **Health**: 100
- **Damage**: 30
- **Drops**: Monster Meat, Hound's Tooth, Ashes, Red Gem (20%), Fire x3
- **Attack Period**: 2
- **Attack Range**: 3
- **Run Speed**: 10
- **Sanity Aura**: -40
- **Special Ability**: Bursts into flames when killed, can travel both land and water
- **Spawns From**: Hound Mound, Varg, Hound

## Quotes
- Wilson: That one is glowy.
- Maxwell: I put fire gems in there as a joke.
- Wickerbottom: That hound is more dangerous than the others.

## Behavior and Strategy
Red Hounds have less health than regular Hounds, cannot be set on fire, and have a higher resistance to the effects of an Ice Staff. Upon death, they "explode" into 3 large fires that will burn for at least six seconds, then extinguish into Ashes. These fires can easily spread to nearby flammable objects. When killed, Red Hounds will always drop 1 Monster Meat and 1 Hound's Tooth, with a chance to drop 1 Red Gem.

### Fighting Strategy
- Hounds are much faster than the player and cannot be outrun unless they become distracted or belong to a Hound Mound.
- One simple strategy to defeat Hounds is by filling up a large area with a set of Tooth Traps and running around the trap field avoiding attacks until the Hounds are killed.

### Hound Attacks
- Red Hounds will accompany normal Hounds during attacks in Summer and Autumn.
- After the second attack, Red Hounds can spawn with normal Hounds during Summer, while Blue Hounds can spawn with normal Hounds during Winter.
- The chances of Red Hounds or Blue Hounds spawning with a pack increases with each day survived.

## Trivia
- Red Hounds and Hounds were added in "The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You" update.
- Red Hounds are the only mobs that take 16 hits from an Ice Staff to be frozen - the maximum for most Mobs is 4.

# Worm Hole

## Overview

A **Worm Hole** is a living tunnel that warps the player to a different area of the map. Worm Holes appear as a mouth in the ground and will open when approached by the player. When the option ‘Jump’ is selected, the character will leap inside to be spit out the other end after a brief delay. There are multiple Worm Holes in most worlds and they always connect the same two places on the map. Often they will end in two completely different areas with different resources, such as a [Forest](with lots of [Tree]s) and a [Savanna](with lots of [Grass]).

Traveling through a Worm Hole costs 15 {{sanity}}. [[Sanity]] can be quickly drained by repeatedly jumping into them. [[Chester]] and other [[:Category:Followers|followers]] will follow the player through Worm Holes. Tradable [[items]], such as [[Food]], [[Gravedigger Items]], and [[Wooden Thing]] components can be dropped into a Worm Hole to be spat out at the other end.

In ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'', items that are not tradable can be dropped into a Worm Hole as well. Players no longer do a sleeping animation after leaving the Worm Hole. Using a [[Clean Sweeper]], the Worm Hole skin can be changed. This change will also appear on the map for both ends of the Worm Hole.

## Description
A **Carrot** is a common **Vegetable**. It can most often be found growing naturally in the ground, but these won't respawn after being picked. **Carrots** can also be **Farmed** by planting **Seeds** for a 31.6% chance of growing or using **Carrot Seeds** (Oblong Seeds), and they can be **Cooked** on a **fire** for extra health when eaten (see below) or used as an ingredient in several **Crock Pot** recipes.

Carrots have a few miscellaneous interactions and uses. Carrots can be given to **Bunnymen** to befriend them, and **underground** they can also be obtained by deconstructing **Rabbit Hutch**es with a **Hammer** or **Deconstruction Staff**, yielding five **Carrots** per **Rabbit Hutch** (Ten with the staff). Feeding a **Carrot** to a **Bird** in a **Birdcage** will produce 1–2 **Carrot Seeds**, as well as a 50% chance for 1 regular **Seeds**. In **Don't Starve Together**, you will always get 1 **Crop Seeds**. **Carrots** will also lure **Rabbits** towards them, whether as bait for **Traps**, or simply dropped. This can be useful for getting **Morsels**, as the **Rabbits** will not run away when eating a **Carrot** dropped on the ground. However, if they are not taken care of, they will consume the entire carrot. **Rabbits** will not eat **Carrots** if they are left planted in the ground.

# Pigs

Pigs are neutral [Mobs] that live in [Pig Houses], which spawn in a variety of [Biomes] and [Set Pieces]. While normally harmless, they will be hostile toward [Webber], [Wortox], and [Wurt]. They also attack [Monster] mobs (e.g. [Spider]s, [Tentacle]s, [Treeguards]) on sight. Pigs drop a [Meat] or a [Pig Skin] upon death. They will respawn from their houses in 4 [Day-Night Cycle] days (32 minutes).

## Behavior

Pigs will return home at dusk and night, or frantically run around if homeless. Providing a light source, such as a [Torch] or a [Campfire], will calm them and they will [Sleeping] sleep beside the light source throughout the night. In [Seasons/Winter] Winter, Pigs will not sleep, but will instead stay awake around the fire with normal dusk dialogue, while displaying a scared animation.

Feeding a Pig [Meats], [Eggs], or [Inedibles] inedible meat (e.g. [Slurper Pelt], Pig Skin, [Bunny Puff]) will cause it to follow the player for up to 2.5 days. The length of time that a Pig will remain loyal is based on the hunger value of the given food. For example, feeding a fresh Morsel will cause the Pig to follow for 240 seconds (12.5 hunger value × 19.2 seconds). If a Pig eats 4 pieces of meat-based Monster Food ({{pic24|Monster Meat}},{{pic|24|Cooked Monster Meat}},{{pic|24|Monster Jerky}},{{pic|24|Monster Lasagna}},{{pic|24|Monster Tartare}}), or is outdoors during a [Full Moon], it will turn into a [Werepig].

## Hunting

Attacking a Pig will aggravate it and up to 5 Pigs within 30m. Aggressive Pigs [[Glossary#K|kite]]; they punch once then withdraw, before approaching the target to punch again.

Pigs can be damaged by Tooth Traps set by the player, but this will not make them hostile.

As Pigs are harder to deal with, will be aggravated by their fellow Pigs being attacked, and are not fully guaranteed to drop their loot when killed, it is quite inadvisable to hunt Pigs in their normal form; killing Pigs in their Werepig form is more predictable, won't aggravate normal Pigs, and guarantees richer drops, therefore is more advisable.

## Usage

Friendly Pigs have a [Sanity] aura of +25/min; however, they naturally tend to keep their distance from others unless they are chopping [Tree|trees], sleeping, or cornered. 
When their loyalty time is less than 60 seconds, Pigs may animate as hungry, by which they pout and rub their bellies. If the time is more than 360 seconds, they may animate as happy.

The Birchnutter is a small, round monster that is spawned in groups by Poison Birchnut Trees. They attack their target by leaping at them, dealing 5 damage on each hit. They are spawned periodically to defend the Poison Birchnut Tree. The large amount of Birchnutters, along with the Poison Birchnut Tree's dangerous roots, make it fairly challenging to cut the tree down. Their attack is avoidable however, and Birchnutters are easy to kill individually. Birchnutters drop Twigs or Birchnuts, meaning they are a good way to farm Birchnuts.

Birchnutters, unlike Eyeplants, can spawn from any kind of turf. They take one hit from an Ice Staff to be frozen, but can't be put to sleep. Instead, they go back underground when a Pan Flute or other similar items are used against them.

# Steadfast Grand Armor

![Steadfast Grand Armor](Steadfast Grand Armor Dropped.png)

- **Protection:** 90%  
- **Perk:** Increases maximum health by 100, Knockback Immunity  
- **Spawn Code:** `lavaarena_armor_hpextraheavy`

## Exclusivity

- **Don't Starve Together**

## Event

- **The Forge**

Steadfast Grand Armor is an unlockable item added in The Forge 2018 event. The community needed to defeat the Great Crucible Hog Warrior N times to unlock the durable Great Armor. After unlocking, it drops on the 9th wave from the Svinorilla, instead of the second hardstone armor.

It is armor for the body cell. Like hardstone armor, it protects against knockbacks. Also, it has a unique feature - the addition of 100 points of maximum health to the wearer.

## Tips

- Knockback protection and extra health are what the team's tanks need. In the late game, you can give it to a runner (most often it is Woody).

# Glommer

## Overview
- **Naughtiness:** 50
- **Health:** 100
- **Sanity Bonus:** +6.25/min (when allied)
- **Drops:** 
  - Killed: Monster Meat x3, Glommer's Wings x1, Glommer's Goop x2
  - Periodically: Glommer's Goop
- **Spawns from:** Glommer's Statue
- **Spawn Code:** "glommer"
- **Lunar Aligned:** 1

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It's cute, in a gross kind of way."
- Willow: "It's fuzzy! And slimy..."
- Wolfgang: "Why you follow me, weird bug?"
- Wendy: "Well aren't you a happy little fuzzball. Die."
- WX-78: "SENTIENT VERSION OF STONE INSECT"
- Wickerbottom: "A bizarre specimen of the insecta class."
- Woodie: "Keep flapping, little guy!"
- Maxwell: "A flying goop factory."
- Wagstaff: "Such a complex arrangement of oculus!"
- Wigfrid: "A majestic gööber."
- Webber: "Nice eyes."
- Walani: "Looks like a friend."
- Warly: "I think I like it."
- Woodlegs: "Ye'll be my first mate."
- Wilba: "AY, THERE'S A BUG"
- Wormwood: "You're nice. Stay close"
- Wheeler: "Do you like flying as much as I do?"
- Winona: "Check out the peepers on this guy."
- Wortox: "What thoughts lurk within that curious noggin?"
- Wurt: "Hee-hee, goopy bug thing!"
- Walter: "Don't be jealous Woby, you'll always be my best friend."
- Wanda: "Who's a cute little bug thing? You are!"
- Choose: Wilson | Source: Glommer

## Behavior
Glommer is a passive mob found during every Full Moon at Glommer's Statue, along with a Glommer's Flower. It follows the player when Glommer's Flower is picked up, similar to Chester and his Eye Bone. When day-time comes and if the flower is still attached to Glommer's Statue, Glommer will fly away up into the air.

When tamed, Glommer provides a Sanity aura of +6.25/min, making it useful in countering the nighttime sanity drain of -5/min. It will also drop Glommer's Goop once every 2–4 days.

Killing Glommer raises the player's Naughtiness by 50, therefore Glommer is the only creature in Reign of Giants that will cause Krampus to immediately spawn when killed by the player.

## Tips
- Glommer can be killed indirectly by luring it near a Catcoon. This avoids summoning Krampus.
- Standing directly next to Glommer during the night can negate the sanity loss from the said time of day.
- Due to the inexistence of the old bell in DST, it may be better to avoid killing glommer, unless the player wishes to summon Krampus. Instead, it is recommended to set Glommer near or at one's base. It will passively produce Glommer's Goop (which can act as a fuel, fertilizer, or food in a pinch). Glommer also restores sanity to any player near him.

## Trivia
- Glommer makes a sort of "zeitzer", or buzzing, sound.
- Wigfrid's umlauts affect the "o" in "Glommer," making it "Glömmer," which means "forgets" in Swedish.
- Wickerbottom's quote describes Glommer as an insect (Insecta), probably due to its six legs. There are many features that don't fit into the real-life classification, however.

# Splumonkey

**Splumonkeys** are neutral mobs found in the Ruins. They live in Splumonkey Pods. They will follow players, stealing items on the ground and looting containers. When killed, they drop any stolen items, 1 Morsel, 1 Cave Banana, and possibly 1 Nightmare Fuel.

**Behavior:**
Splumonkeys pick Bananas from Cave Banana Trees, Berries from Berry Bushes, and any Mushrooms in sight. They will harvest crops from Farm plots, steal items from Chests, Ice Boxes, Backpacks, Chester, Hutch, and Woby, plus take Food from Crock Pots. If they pick up a Hat, they will wear it. The hat will give the same benefits to the Splumonkey as a player (a Miner Hat will provide light, a Football Helmet defense, etc.), and will lose durability at the same rate a player would.

**Attack:**
Like many other neutral mobs, if one Splumonkey is attacked, all nearby Splumonkeys will become aggressive toward the attacker. Splumonkeys defend themselves by throwing Manure at a distance or biting enemies that come within melee range. Being hit by Manure causes damage (0 health will be lost however) and lowers Sanity by 10 points. Splumonkeys can hold a maximum of three Manure, and eating Food items will replenish this count. They prefer to run from any attacker and throw any Manure they have from a distance, so the player may need to corner a Splumonkey in order to get close enough to hurt it with melee weapons.

**Nightmare Cycle:**
When the Nightmare Cycle reaches the Nightmare Phase, Splumonkeys turn into Shadow Splumonkeys and become hostile to the player, all humanoids (Merm, Pigs, Bunnyman etc.), any Monster and follower in the vicinity. When killed, they drop Beard Hair in addition to their usual drops. When the Nightmare Cycle resumes the Calm Phase, Splumonkeys revert to their normal form and lose their aggression.

**Tips:**
- If a Splumonkey and a player remain idle with an item between them, the Splumonkey will forget the player and attempt to pick up the item. The window of them stealing the item can be used to kill the Splumonkey.
- Despite having low stats, their numbers, projectile attacks, and relentlessness make these creatures extremely dangerous as they are capable of stunlocking the player for an indefinite amount of time.
- A quick way to get rid of them is to burn their pods with a Fire Staff or Torch. One can then kill them one by one or let them die to any nearby mobs.

**Bugs:**
- In Don't Starve Together, Splumonkeys can kidnap Spiders that have been befriended by Webber.

**Trivia:**
- The name "Splumonkey" is a portmanteau of the words "Spelunk" and "Monkey."
- Their inclusion is a possible reference to the term "Underground Monkey", which is the practice of reusing mob sprites in role-playing games by placing them in different areas (placing animals in strange biomes) with the common example being a subterranean monkey enemy.

# Petrifying Tome

- **Equip Slot:** Hands
- **Damage:** 15
- **Perk:** Petrifies enemies in spell circle. (Petrification essentially forces mobs to lower their shields. Resistance to petrification can be worked around.)
- **Spawn Code:** `book_fossil`
- **Exclusivity:** Don't Starve Together
- **Event:** The Forge

The Petrifying Tome is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together. Available immediately from Maxwell and Wickerbottom. This item is a melee weapon. When attacking, the character swings the tome and deals 15 damage to the target.

### Main Ability: Petrify

When used, all enemies caught in the area of effect are turned to stone for a long period of time, thus being unable to attack and move, which completely neutralizes them until they take damage: then the stone collapses and enemies become aggressive.

### Trivia

- **Boarilla**, **Grand Forge Boarrior**, and **Infernal Swineclops** do not turn to stone when using the book; instead, their limbs will be in stones for 2 seconds, which allows you to buy some time.

# The Tome of Beckoning

- **Damage**: 15
- **Equip Slot**: Hands
- **Perk**: Summons a Magma Golem that attacks nearby enemies, dealing 25 damage with each hit. (Magma Golem can be attacked, and immediately despawns when hit. Also, it won't hit sleeping Mobs.)
- **Spawn Code**: `book_elemental`
- **Exclusivity**: Don't Starve Together
- **Event**: The Forge

The Tome of Beckoning is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together (an unlockable item in the 2018 Crucible). It drops on wave 9.

This item is a melee weapon. When attacking, a character swings the tome and deals 15 damage to the target.

The Tome of Beckoning's main ability is for calling upon Magma Golems. When used, a [Magma Golem] is summoned.

## Tips

- The only characters able to use the summon tome are Ms. Wickerbottom and Maxwell. If a team wishes to use this booklet, one of them must be chosen before the start of the round.
- Wickerbottom's empowered spell makes the golem more powerful: the elemental deals 38 damage per shot.
- If Wickerbottom or Maxwell are using an infernal staff, they can sometimes pick up a tome of summoning to summon a golem, then continue throwing fireballs left and right.

# Clockwork Knight

![Clockwork Knight](Clockwork Knight.png)

The **Clockwork Knight** is an aggressive [Mob] usually found in a [Chess Set Piece]. It can also be summoned by mining [Marble Sculpture] at full moon.

## Behavior

When a mob or the player gets close, the Knight will stand up and stare at the creature, and if the creature gets close enough, the Knight will do a war cry and charge at it, using its springy neck to headbutt when it gets close. The Knight will then attempt to kite. If the knight is followed, it will usually try to headbutt once more, then it will do its war cry again. The Knight cannot be stun-locked and does not respawn.

## Hunting

Unlike other Chess Pieces, there is nothing spectacular in a Clockwork Knight's abilities and it is overall the easiest one to defeat. The easiest way to kill Knights is by kiting them. When in groups, it is recommended to separate one from the rest of the group, killing it, then separating another. As they usually do their battle cry before attempting to attack again, players may find it effective to attack a Knight while it is doing this, then backing away as soon as it tries to headbutt the player.

## Trivia

- The Clockwork Knight was introduced in the "[A Little Rain Must Fall]" update.
- The Clockwork Knight has a random chance to do a battle cry before attacking.

## Description

The Ancient Guardian is a Boss Monster found within the Labyrinth region of the Ruins. It looks and acts similarly to a Clockwork Rook, but appears as a living creature covered in fur.

In Don't Starve Together, the Ancient Guardian has 10,000 Health and will respawn when the Reanimated Skeleton#Ancient Fuelweaver|Ancient Fuelweaver is killed, making Guardian's Horns renewable.

Ancient Guardian's fight functions differently from the base game. It will charge towards the player but will be stunned for 1.5-6 seconds if it hits one of the pillars, allowing the player to attack; the longer time that Ancient Guardian charged, the longer the Ancient Guardian will be stunned when it hit an obstacle. When the Ancient Guardian charges into a pillar, it will cause a small earthquake. The earthquake drops 20 minerals like Flint, Rocks, and Nitre over 2.5 seconds within 5 tiles of the Ancient Guardian, as well as dropping up to 4 Pillar Fragments within 6.25 tiles. The Pillar Fragments can stun the Ancient Guardian if it charges into them, akin to entire pillars.

Once its health goes below 6,000, it will enter its second phase. It gains a new attack where it jumps and slams the ground into the player's position, similar to the Hippopotamoose from the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. If the player manages to dodge the slam, the Ancient Guardian will be stunned for 3.6 seconds, but if the player fails the dodge, it will continue to attack as normal. During this phase, it has 1-5% of bleeding when attacked, which then spawn up to 5 Shadow Tentacles within 1 tile. The Ancient Guardian has a higher chance of bleeding shadow tentacle when it has lower health. The shadow tentacles deal 60 damage per hit and are invulnerable.

Ancient Guardian has an aggro range of 6.25 tiles.

## Fighting with a Spear

The Ancient Guardian has 10000 Health and deals 100 damage per hit. It charges at its target similarly to a Clockwork

# Damaged Clockwork Knight

## Overview
The Damaged Clockwork Knight, a pale and battered knight covered in Nightmare Fuel, possesses the same base stats as the regular [Clockwork Knight](Clockwork Knight). It drops 1 [Gears], and has a chance to drop [Nightmare Fuel] and/or [Thulecite Fragments]. This creature naturally occurs in the [Ruins], and can also spawn from [Broken Clockworks] when destroyed.

## Combat Stats
- **Health:** 900
- **Damage:** 40
- **Attack Period:** 2
- **Walk Speed:** 5

## Drops
- [Gears] (always)
- [Nightmare Fuel] (60% chance)
- [Thulecite Fragments] (50% chance)

## Special Abilities
The Damaged Knight can become a follower if created from [Broken Clockworks](Broken Clockworks).

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It's a knightmare!"
- Willow: "It looks pretty worn down."
- Wolfgang: "Funny metal man."
- Wendy: "Another battle lost to time."
- WX-78: "REPROGRAMMING REQUIRED"
- Wickerbottom: "Its nightmare fueled surroundings have corrupted its programming."
- Woodie: "Doesn't look to be in the best of shape."
- Maxwell: "It looks beyond repair."
- Wagstaff: "I would very much like to see its insides."
- Wigfrid: "I don't think I'd ride that horse."

- Wormwood: "Busted"
- Wheeler: "Reminds me of the broken down merry-go-round I saw once."
- Winona: "You're in rough shape, hey?"
- Wortox: "Eep! Play nice with the imp!"
- Wurt: "Glurp, it has the bad stuff on it!"
- Walter: "Heh, spooky!"
- Wanda: "I... I don't want to look at it."

## Shadow Rift Content
If caught in [Acid Rain], the Damaged Knight's damage attack decreases by 15%, move speed decreases by 15%, and taking damage increases by 25%.

## Hunting
The recommended way to kill Knights is by kiting them. When in groups, it is recommended to separate one from the rest of the group, kill it, then separate another. When fighting multiple, it is important to get them on the same kiting pattern, where they both attack at the same time. The Knights occasionally do a battle cry, after around 3 attacks. This opportunity can be used to get in more hits before it attacks again.

## Trivia
- The Damaged Knight was added in "[A Moderately Friendly Update](Don't Starve/Version History#A Moderately Friendly Update)".

# Clockwork Rook

## Mob Information
![Clockwork Rook](Clockwork Rook.png)
- **Health**: 900
- **Damage**: 45 (hit) / 200 (charge attack, mobs only)
- **Attack Period**: 2
- **Walk Speed**: 5
- **Run Speed**: 16
- **Special Ability**: Ram charges destroying structures in its path.
- **Spawn Code**: "rook"
- **Drops**: ![Gears](Gears.png) ×2
- **Spawn From**: ![Sculpture Rookbody Repaired](Sculpture Rookbody Repaired.png)

## Quotes
- **Wolfgang**: This one jumps the queen!
- **Wilson**: Storm the castle!
- **Willow**: It's a castle!
- **Woodie**: Hmm... does the rook move in a straight line? I forget.
- **Maxwell**: A castle for my home.
- **Wagstaff**: Such admirable clockwork! I will examine it more closely when I destroy it.
- **Wendy**: A Rook? Or is it a Castle?
- **Woodlegs**: She's full steam ahead!
- **Wickerbottom**: A clockwork castle.
- **Webber**: Who made these things!?
- **Warly**: What a rude contraption.
- **WX-78**: ROOK AUTOMATON
- **Walani**: Check, mate!
- **Wigfrid**: Chaaaarge!
- **Wilba**: HATH CASTLE ON'ST NOSE
- **Wormwood**: Rock machine
- **Wheeler**: Swell. And I was having such a good day.
- **Winona**: No way that was made in a factory.
- **Wortox**: A scary rook! I sure am shook!
- **Wurt**: Look mean...
- **Walter**: I wonder how it works?
- **Wanda**: I'm not convinced that's proper clockwork.

## Behavior
Clockwork Rooks stare at players coming close to them. If too close, a Clockwork Rook will raise its front leg and slam on the ground several times before charging at and ramming the player. It will also destroy anything that stands in between it and the player, including other clockwork pieces. This is useful, as Clockwork Rooks will often kill other chess pieces in a couple of hits. Their attacks can be used to destroy structures as well, similar to Deerclops and Krampus. When the Rook hits a Tree, Boulder, or Beehive for example, it will quickly demolish it and leave the resources behind. This can be useful for helping to get Marble from Marble Trees without a Pickaxe.

Clockwork Rooks are not only naturally aggressive towards players, but also towards Pigs, Merms, Chester, Hutch, Mandrakes, Rock Lobsters, MacTusk and his son, Bunnymen and any monsters except other Clockwork Monsters and Ancient Guardians that wander too close to them.

## Tips
- A simple (albeit time-consuming) way to deal with Clockwork Rooks without taking damage is to let one chase the character into a nearby forest and let it destroy some Trees. This will eventually spawn a Treeguard, who will attack the Rook and usually kill it due to its superior health and damage output. This method is also useful for chopping down large amounts of trees and farming Logs and Pine Cones with little to no effort. (The leftover Treeguard can be used to deal with Deerclops or other bosses later on.)
- Note that the above strategy does not work well with Birchnut Trees as both Poison Birchnut Trees and the Birchnutters they summon will be easily obliterated by the Rook's charge in seconds. This, however, allows for much larger-scale farming since the Rook will take little to no damage each time.
- Rooks exclusively deal 200 damage to mobs that come in their way, making them very effective against hordes of low-hp enemies. A Clockwork Rook can kill entire groups of weaker mobs like Spiders in a single charge.

## Trivia
- The Clockwork Rook was implemented in the Hungry For Your Hunger update.
- The mob's design draws inspiration from the castle (or rook) in chess, which also can only charge ahead in straight lines.
- The Clockwork Rook was originally called a Clockwork Castle.
- The Clockwork Rook looks very similar to the Ancient Guardian, even possessing identical feet, possibly implying that it was made to imitate the guardian.
- It is best to have a Rook destroy all nearby monsters and marble trees before killing it.
- If the player dies and respawns,

# Spiral Spear

- **Perk**: User leaps up offscreen into the sky, before divebombing a berry bush-sized area for 75 damage. (Drops only if Wigfrid is currently in the party. Replaces the 2nd Molten Darts drop.)
- **Equip Slot**: Hands
- **Spawn Code**: `spear_gungnir`
- **Damage**: 30
- **Exclusivity**: Don't Starve Together
- **Event**: The Forge

## Description

The **Spiral Spear** is an item added to **The Forge** in **Don't Starve Together** (an unlockable item in the 2018 Crucible). Dropped by the last enemy of wave 9.

This item is considered a melee weapon. When attacking, a character swings the spear and deals 30 damage to the target.

The main ability of the spiral spear is a strike from the sky (**Sky Lunge**). When used, a character soars up and appears at the selected point, dealing area damage to all enemies.

The Warcry character (Wigfrid's special ability) has a second special ability for this item: he makes 5 quick hits, dealing 38 damage each.

## Tips

- This melee weapon drops in the late waves, with strong opponents, so it is desirable to have good armor in addition to it.
- With the help of a blow from the sky, you can not only attack enemies, but also get out of a dangerous situation by choosing a place far from the battlefield.
- It's best for Wigfrid not to use the Spiral Lance when the healer is about to place a lifebloom under the Great Hog Furnace Warrior, as it may trigger a warcry and cause the boar to fall asleep later and even kill someone.

## Trivia

- In the 2018 event, this weapon was unlockable following the DST Community's victory over Svinorillas via the Summoning Tome.

# Scalemail

- **DLC**: Reign of Giants, Hamlet, Don't Starve Together
- **Crafting Requirements**:
  - 1 Scales
  - 1 Log Suit
  - 3 Pig Skin
  - Crafted in the Fight Tab
- **Durability**: 945 HP
- **Perk**: Grants immunity to fire damage, ignites attackers, restores sanity over time.
- **Sanity Drain**: +3.3/min
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "armordragonfly"
- **Tier**: 2
- **Description**: Armor with a fiery temper.
- **Protection**: 70%

## Quotes

- Wilson: Hot mail!
- Willow: Yay! More FIRE!!!
- Wolfgang: Wolfgang not need protection.
- Wendy: I'd like to wear it inside-out.
- WX78: SCALES FUNCTION SIMILAR TO MINIATURE FLAMETHROWERS
- Wickerbottom: Pyrotechnic armor!
- Woodie: Plaid is all the armor I need.
- Maxwell: That's some fly mail.
- Wagstaff: Is it made of asbestos?
- Wigfrid: Excellent armor for the heat of battle.
- Webber: Another creature casing.
- Walani: This armor is so hot right now.
- Warly: Heavy and hot.
- Woodlegs: She be hot to the touch of me enemies!
- Wilba: 'TIS A FWOOSHING ARMOR

- Winona: Bit flashy, hey?
- Wortox: Ooo, I've always wanted to be scaly.
- Wurt: More scales!!
- Walter: I still wish we could've been friends...
- Wanda: I think it looks better on me than it did on the bug.
- Choose: Willow

## Skins

- **Jagged Dragonfly Armor**: Inspired by the visage of the mighty beast from which it's made. (associated with: Log Suit)
- **Roman Dragonfly Armor**
- **Dragonfly Haramaki**: Flawlessly polished Dragonfly scales compose this Haramaki, accented with a yellow silken sash. (associated with: Log Suit)
- **Dragonfly Body Armor**: Running your hand down this armor is smooth one way and sharp the other. (associated with: Log Suit)

## Tips

- Wearing Scalemail to regain Sanity will not decrease its durability, allowing infinite Sanity regeneration as long as the wearer stays out of combat-heavy situations.
- Its fire immunity makes it ideal for fighting the Dragonfly, making the second encounter with the giant much easier than the first.
- Care should be taken when fighting regular Mobs. When they are set on fire by the armor, they can spread fire to nearby structures and plants, possibly harming the player's resources.
- As this is difficult to obtain and cannot be repaired, one should always wear a Football Helmet or better head armor with it in combat, so as to avoid it losing too much durability. In DST, the head armor should be equipped last to make it lose more durability from damage than the armor.
- Using the Deconstruction Staff on a damaged Scalemail will return 1 Scale, 1 Log Suit with 100% durability, and a number of Pig Skin relative to the damage on the Scalemail (armor at: 100% ~ 68% = 3 pig skins; 67% ~ 35% = 2 pig skins; 34% ~ 1% = 1 pig skin). In conclusion, it's possible to renew the Scalemail at the cost of 20% of the Deconstruction Staff and some Pig Skins.

## Trivia

- With the introduction of Scalemail, Willow is no longer the only character that can be immune to fire damage. She is the only one naturally immune to fire damage without special effects in place.
- The Scalemail used to have the same stats as the Thulecite Suit and wasn't able to set Mobs on fire.
- Like the Log Suit, this armor also makes a slight noise while the player is moving.

# Volt Goat

The Volt Goat is an animal found in the Reign of Giants DLC and is indigenous to the Desert biome. It's essentially a living Lightning Rod; any Lightning that strikes in the vicinity will seek out and charge the Volt Goat, causing it to radiate electricity and glow for 3 days. Unlike most other creatures found in groups, attacking one Volt Goat will not cause the rest of the herd to become hostile to the attacker.

## Characteristics

- **Naughtiness**: 4
- **Health**: 700
- **Damage**: 25 (charged, dry target: 37.5, charged, wet target: 62.5)
- **Attack Period**: 2
- **Attack Range**: 3
- **Walk Speed**: 4
- **Run Speed**: 8
- **Spawns From**: Suspicious Dirt Pile
- **Spawn Code**: lightninggoat
- **Special Ability**: Becomes charged by lightning, deals electrical damage (charged), stuns opponents with electricity (charged)
- **Drops**: Meat x2, Volt Goat Horn (25%), Electric Milk x1 (charged)

## Quotes

- Wilson: "Baaaah" yourself!
- Willow: Bouncy goat.
- Wolfgang: Hello, goat.
- Wendy: Look at those hooves.
- WX78: DOES IT HAVE MECHANICAL INSIDES?
- Wickerbottom: A variant of Capra aegagrus, keen on electricity.
- Woody: That's a nice pair of horns you've got there.
- Maxwell: What's it always chewing on?

... (Other quotes are omitted for brevity)

## Fighting Strategy

| Weapon | No. of hits for Volt Goat |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Fishing Rod & Bug Net | 83 |
| Lucy the Axe | 26 |
| Shovel & Pitchfork | 21 |
| Hammer & Torch & Umbrella | 13 |
| Walking Cane & Willow's Lighter | 11 |
| Axe & Pickaxe | 9 |
| Luxury Axe & Opulent Pickaxe | 6-11 |
| Boomerang | 5 or 9 |
| PickSlashAxe | 7 |
| Spear | 6 |
| Bat Bat | 4 |
| Ham Bat | 2 |

A Volt Goat takes 2 blasts from the Ice Staff to be frozen and 4 Sleep Darts to be put to sleep.

## Tips

- Wearing a Rain Hat, Rain Coat, or Eyebrella will insulate the player against the electricity of a charged Volt Goat.
- Using a Morning Star or an Electric Dart on an uncharged Volt Goat will charge it, so using it is ill-advised unless the player is after Electric Milk.
- Setting up Honey production close to Volt Goats will allow for more efficient production of Ice Cream and Volt Goat Chaud-Froid in Don't Starve Together.

## Trivia

- Volt Goats were originally planned to be exclusive to their own biome filled with Tesla Trees, but this idea was later scrapped.
- Wickerbottom refers to it as a subspecies of Capra aegagrus. In real life, Capra aegagrus is the scientific name of the Wild Goat.
- The death animation of the Volt Goat is reminiscent to how fainting goats pass out when startled.

# Lucy the Axe

![Lucy the Axe](Lucy_the_Axe_Dropped.png) 

Lucy the Axe is a character-specific item that Woodie begins the game with. Lucy has infinite durability and increased effectiveness (one swing at a tree is worth two "chops" of a regular axe) and in Woodie's hands, who has a faster innate chopping animation, cuts trees extraordinarily fast. Lucy is a sentient being, and although it's not known if this is real or just Woodie's imagination, this is likely the former, as in DST, others can see her quotes. When equipped, Lucy will speak a line such as 'I missed you', 'Did you miss me?' and 'You came back!'.

## Attributes

- **Damage**: 13.6
- **Durability**: Infinite ([[Tools#Chopping_Tools|Chopping]])
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Perk**: Has infinite durability. Reduces the amount of chops required to chop a tree by half. [[#Quotes|Gives friendly advice]].

## Quotes

### Main Game

- When Idling (equipped): "Let's chop some trees!"
- When put in a container: "It's dark in here!"
- When dropped on ground: "You'll come back, right?"
- When on ground: "Come back! Take me with you!"
- When equipped: "I missed you so much!"
- After chopping a tree: "Woooooo!"
- Approaching transformation (low): "Are you okay?"
- Approaching transformation (med): "Don't chop too fast. You know what will happen!"
- Approaching transformation (high): "Woodie! Be careful!"
- When Woodie comes down from high without transforming: "That was a close one!"
- When Woodie transforms: "Oh no!"
- When Woodie turns back: "You're back!"
- When Beaverness is slightly low: "Are you okay?"
- When Beaverness is moderately low: "Hello? Can you hear me?"
- When Beaverness is extremely low: "No! Don't chop any more!"
- When Woodie recovers without transforming: "That was a close one!"
- Picked up when already holding a Lucy: "You two-timer!"
- Picked up by another character: "Put me down!"
- Haunted by a Ghost character: "Ouch, that hurts."
- When used in Crafting: "Watch me work my magic!"

## Trivia

- Lucy is the first item that can speak and has distinct lines, not just sound effects, like the Living Log's scream.
- Lucy does not appear to recognize Woodie when he is a ghost.
- Lucy is voiced by a musical saw.
- When playing Adventure Mode, Lucy will not use a slot in the Teleportato. She will appear in Woodie's inventory after arriving in the new world.
- Lucy's line, "All work and no play makes me want to chop trees", is a reference to the English proverb "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". This may also be a reference to the pivotal scene in the Stephen King film "The Shining", where insane character Jack Torrance types this line many times, and later uses an axe similar to Lucy as a weapon.
- Lucy's line "You're the ghostest with the mostest." is a reference to the movie Beetlejuice.
- Kevin Forbes added Lucy for Woodie's special item because he "liked the idea of a half-crazed lumberjack being egged on by his axe."

# Butterfly

The **Butterfly** is a passive [Mob] commonly found in [Grassland] biomes. They spawn from [Flower]s (including Evil Flowers) and will slowly fly around, often landing on other Flowers within 30 meters. At dusk, they will attempt to land on a Flower to despawn. Butterflies do not spawn during Winter or in Caves.

## Attributes

- **Naughtiness**: 1
- **Health**: 1
- **Walk Speed**: 5
- **Run Speed**: 5
- **Stack**: 20
- **Perk**: Can be planted as [Flower]
- **Spoil**: Does not Spoil
- **Spawn From**: [Flower], [Evil Flower]
- **Drops**: [Butterfly Wings] 98%, [Butter] 2%
- **Spawn Code**: "butterfly"

## Interactions

Butterflies can be caught with [Bug Net]. As inventory items, they can be used to plant Flowers, which can spawn additional Butterflies or improve the production of [Honey] in [Bee Box]es. In all DLCs, Butterflies inside the player's inventory will starve in 2 days unless fed. They can be fed with anything edible to the player, however, the damage of the food applies to Butterflies as well, killing them if fed due to Butterflies only having 1 hp.

When killed, Butterflies drop [Butterfly Wings] (98% chance) or [Butter] (2% chance). Butterfly Wings can be eaten to restore 8 hp each, or used in a [Crock Pot] to cook [Butter Muffin]s. Killing one adds 1 point to the player's naughtiness level. Catching Butterflies with a [Bug Net] will not affect naughtiness.

## Hunting

Butterflies will try to move 10 meters away from the player, when the player is within 5 meters, making them difficult to attack using melee weapons. The best time to attack Butterflies is when they land on Flowers, where they will rest for a few seconds. Hunting in an area with many Flowers will provide many opportunities to hit them. If a player scared the butterfly by being within 5 meters, the player can move to 10 meters away from the butterfly to calm the butterfly, to perhaps be in a better situation to kill the butterfly.

Even a fleeing Butterfly can be chased down and killed by pressing the force-attack button (Ctrl+F) within range. The butterfly's actual position is best determined through its shadow. The [Walking Cane] makes chasing and attacking butterflies much easier.

When caught using a Bug Net, a live Butterfly will become an item in the player's inventory (stacks to 20). With the Bug Net equipped, pressing the Spacebar automatically chases and catches Butterflies rather than picking nearby Flowers.

Butterflies die in one hit from any weapon. Butterflies take one blast from the [Ice Staff] to be frozen and cannot be put to sleep.

## Farming

- A flower can be planted in the middle of base. The flower in a communal base will spawn butterfly faster, scaling with the number of players in base, since there are multiple players around to contribute to butterfly's spawn rate. The butterflies can be killed by an aggressive Abigail, or a player camping beside the flower. Having more flowers is counterproductive as they randomise the possible spawning spot for butterfly.
- A flower can be planted near [Beefalo] herds. Beefaloes will attack any Butterflies that spawn from Flowers during their mating season. Any items that the Butterflies drop can be safely collected while wearing a [Beefalo Hat].
- A flower can be planted near [Magma]. The spawning butterflies will die due to the fire damage.

## Trivia

- Maxwell's examination quote of the Butterfly ("It's a flying flower.") can either be interpreted as an explanation as to why they are plantable or a reference to their use as a flower-spawner.
- Butterflies dropping Butter, as stated in Maxwell's examination quote for Butter, is a pun on the word "Butterfly". It may also be a reference to German folklore. Witches were said to turn into butterflies to steal butter and cream.

# Year of the Dragonfly

![Year of the Dragonfly Motd Box](Year of the Dragonfly Motd Box.png)

## Dates
- **2024:** February 8 - ???

## Developer
- **Klei Entertainment**

## Preceded by
- **Year of the Bunnyman**

The **Year of the Dragonfly** is an event in **Don't Starve Together**, lasting from February 8 until ???, 2024. It is inspired by the Chinese Year of the Dragon, which started from February 10, 2024. In the Chinese zodiac, each year is related to an animal in a 12-year cycle.

It is similar to the Year of the Gobbler, Year of the Varg, Year of the Pig King, Year of the Carrat, Year of the Beefalo, Year of the Catcoon, and Year of the Bunnyman events, which came in the years before, and shares some mechanics with them, such as the Offerings crafting filter, and most crafted items from those events. However, there are several additions and differences to be implemented into this event. Players can revisit this event by setting **Events** to **Year of the Dragonfly** in the **World Customization** menu.

The main idea of the event is that you must place a Start Tower on the water, after which 3 Race Checkpoints will appear (the player can place a couple more Race Checkpoints). After that, the players gather in the designated Race Checkpoint area and one of them activates it. After reporting to 3, a race will begin in which players must touch each Race Checkpoint with their boats and then return back to the Start Tower. The first one to do this wins and receives several Red Pouch. After the first player touches the Start Tower, a timer will begin, during which the other boats that touched all the Race Checkpoints must return to the zone to receive a prize. Otherwise, the player receives nothing.

On land, the Trident deals the same amount of damage as a **Spear**.

# Bearger

**Bearger** is one of the [[Giants]] in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'', representing the season of [[Seasons/Autumn|Autumn]]. If the player starts in Autumn with the default settings, Bearger will not spawn in the first season and will instead appear in the following year.

## Drops
- [[File:Meat.png|24px|link=Meat]]x8
- [[File:Thick Fur.png|24px|link=Thick Fur]]

## Stats
- **Health**: 6000
- **Damage**: 175 to mobs, receives 87 damage from players
- **Attack Period**: 3 seconds
- **Attack Range**: 5
- **Walk Speed**: 3 (casual), 6 (aggressive)
- **Run Speed**: 10
- **Sanity Drain**: {{SanityMult|-400|note=(in combat)}}{{SanityMult|-100|note=(otherwise)}}

## Special Abilities
- AoE attacks. Eats food from containers and on the ground. Sheds fur every 45 seconds.

## Behavior
To spawn a Bearger, three requirements have to be met:
1. The world is more than 28 days
2. More than 26 days has passed since the last Bearger killed
3. It is Autumn

## Attacks
| Attack | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Swipe  | Bearger will use a swipe attack at close range, dealing damage and knocking the weapon out of the player's hand. It will use this attack up to three consecutive times before using its slam attack. |
| Slam   | Once Bearger has used 3 swipes, it will slam the ground with its front paws, creating a shockwave that will demolish [[Structures]], fell Trees, and uproot [[Plants]] in a large area as well as knock the player's weapon from their hand. This attack only does damage within Bearger's melee range, despite damaging objects at a larger distance. |
| Charge | If the player runs away from Bearger when it is about to do its slam attack, it will charge after the player, destroying objects in its path. When it either catches up to the player or has been running for long enough, it will use its slam attack. |

## Strategy
### General Melee
- The player can attack Bearger 3-4 times before dodging, except after it slams the ground, as a swipe attack follows immediately after.
- Equipping at least a [[Log Suit]] or [[Football Helmet]] is recommended.

### Treeguards
- A highly recommended way to kill Bearger is to lure it into an Evergreen forest and have it destroy trees, until one or more [[Treeguard]]s spawn.

### Gunpowders
- A fast way to deal with the Bearger is a combination of immobilization and [[Gunpowder]]s.

### Poisoning
- Unlike other bosses, Bearger will eat any Food it sees and is affected by poisonous Foods (such as Red Mushrooms or Monster Meat).

## Trivia
- Bearger's [[Winter's Feast]] appearance in ''Don't Starve Together'' resembles the [[Wikipedia:Yeti|Yeti]] (also known as the Abominable Snowman), a mythical ape-like creature rumored to inhabit regions in the Himalayas.
- The name Bearger is a portmanteau of the words "Bear" and "Badger", as highlighted by Wilson's quote.
