## Scrapbook Info
When used at a Celestial Portal, the survivor can change to a different survivor.

## Description
The Moon Rock Idol is a craftable Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together. It is found in the Celestial Filter and requires a Moon Rock and a Purple Gem to be crafted.

Moon Rock Idols can be offered to the Celestial Portal, which despawns the survivor and returns the player to the Character select screen. This effectively allows the player to switch characters. 

Doing so will cause the player to drop their entire Inventory at the Celestial Portal, however they retain their Day count, Map exploration progress, any prototyped Crafting recipes, and any adopted Critters. The Moon Rock Idol is consumed in the process.

## Character Interactions
- All characters with skill trees have their skills reset and their Insight fully refunded, allowing the player to return again with different upgrades from what they had prior.
- If switching from Woodie, Lucy the Axe turns into a regular Axe when returning as a different character.
- Changing from Walter despawns Woby without dropping her inventory, making it best to empty Woby's inventory before switching characters.
- As Wickerbottom is able to craft Science Items with a lower tier Crafting Station than other characters from the start, if the player had crafted any of those recipes, it would appear as not learned when changing from Wickerbottom to another character.

## Trivia
- When it was first introduced in the Celestial Update, changing characters using a Moon Rock Idol reset the player's Map, Day Count, and Crafting Recipes. This is no longer the case as of update 288118.
- The Idol glows when it's in proximity to the Celestial Portal.
- It gives off a small amount of light at night, but is not an appropriate light source to ward off Charlie.
- When the Moon Rock Idol is offered to the Celestial Portal, the Character performs an animation similar to the one used for the Lazy Deserter.
- The unique Character quotes when offering a Moon Rock Idol seem to indicate that using the Celestial Portal is similar to the classic description of death, in which one is said to see a bright light.
- WX-78's quote, "I SEE THE BLUE SCREEN!" is referencing the Stop Error screen that appears when a windows computer's operation system crashes.
- Maxwell's quote, "Say pal, I don't look so good..." is an altered version of his quote at the beginning of a world in Don't Starve.

## Description

Bull Kelp is a **Plant** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. It grows naturally on the **Coastal Ocean**, but can also be found stranded in the **Rocky Beach** **Biome** on the **Lunar Island** and on **Hermit Island**.

Bull Kelp can be picked to obtain **Kelp Fronds**. It then takes 3 full **Days** to regrow. When picked on the beach, it additionally yields a **Bull Kelp Stalk**. They are not affected by **Winter** cold.

Bull Kelp can be pushed towards the mainland with a boat to pick it from any coast without first sailing out. Picking it like that will yield the same results as picking it while on a boat.

Bull Kelp can be uprooted by using a **Strident Trident**, **Cannonball**, or by forcing onto land by pushing it with a boat.

# Don't Starve Together: Year of the Dragonfly - Boat Racer

## Event: Year of the Dragonfly

During Boat Racer, you need to touch the Start Tower and wait for the countdown. After reporting to 3, a race will begin in which players must touch each **Race Checkpoint** with their boats and then return back to the **Start Tower**. The first one to do this wins and receives several **Red Pouches**. After the first player touches the Start Tower, a timer will begin, during which the other boats that touched all the Race Checkpoints must return to the zone to receive a prize. Otherwise, the player receives nothing.

For greater convenience, an arrow appears on the ship indicating the nearest Race Checkpoint which the ship did not touch. As soon as you touch the Race Checkpoint, a flyer will appear on it in the color of the arrow on your ship.

### Marble Pillars are naturally spawning Structures found around the Wooden Thing in a Chess biome in Sandbox Mode or in various Chess biomes in Adventure Mode. Usually, there are Clockwork Monsters and Evil Flowers near them. They can be mined with a Pickaxe or the Pick/Axe to acquire 2-3 Marble pieces. The pickaxe requires 10 hits to break a Marble Pillar down, whereas the Pick/Axe only requires 8. Though it may use a lot of durability off a pickaxe, it is recommended to mine Marble Pillars so the player can make a Marble Suit for fighting.

## Trivia

- Marble Pillars were introduced in the [A Little Rain Must Fall](#) update.
- Marble Pillars used to spawn around Maxwell's Door in the old versions of Don't Starve.

## Description
Flowers are found in Grasslands, Forests, or Savanna biomes. They cannot be found in Marshes or Rockyland. When picked, they restore 5 Sanity and produce Petals, which, when eaten, restore 1 Health. There are 10 different kinds of Flowers, but they all have the same effect.

Flowers serve a variety of purposes. Picking 12 of them for their Petals allows the creation of a Garland, which provides a Sanity boost over time in addition to the 5 Sanity gained from picking each Flower. This is especially useful early on in the game.

Flowers also spawn Butterflies, which can be killed for their Butterfly Wings or Butter, or be captured in a Bug Net. Captured Butterflies can be planted anywhere to produce a new Flower, thus making each of these items renewable. Homeless Bees can also produce Flowers over time, after pollinating 6 Flowers. Many Flowers can be planted together to build a Butterfly farm, an area where Butterflies can easily be killed for their wings. Large groups of Flowers are also useful for Honey production. Building Bee Boxes near such fields increases the speed at which the Bees produce Honey.

Flowers will spawn without the aid of Butterflies or Bees in the Rain. During a full moon, Flowers will turn into Evil Flowers, and return to normal afterwards.

A Ghost Character can haunt a regular Flower to turn it into an Evil Flower.

## Cultivation
Flowers can be manually cultivated by planting living Butterflies. Using a Bug Net to capture any number of Butterflies, the player can right click them on the ground to plant them as they would plant Pine Cones or Grass Tufts. One Butterfly can be planted to create one Flower in a location of the player's choosing. The physical area occupied by the Flower is very small, allowing for densely planted Flower garden.

Cultivation of Flowers is of interest because of their Sanity bonus when picked and use for Crafting the Garland and the Pretty Parasol, however the long term use of cultivation is the creation of efficient Honey farms through the use of Bee Boxes, for which an ample supply of Flowers is necessary.

Because Flowers spawn Butterflies, cultivation of a large Flower bed can usually proceed very quickly, provided the player has sufficient materials to build new Bug Nets.

## Details
The Dragonfly Light is a craftable item exclusive to Don't Starve Together. It can be deployed on a Mast or Winged Sail and is mutually exclusive with the Lightning Conductor. It provides up to 6 minutes of light and can be fueled with the same efficiency as a Campfire. Unlike Fire Pits, Wavey Jones will extinguish it instantly no matter how much Fuel it has, rather than reducing it by one stage at a time.

The Magician's Chest is a craftable Structure exclusive to Don't Starve Together. It can only be crafted by Maxwell from 1 Silk, 4 Boards, and 9 Nightmare Fuel.

The Magician's Chest lets the characters access to the Shadow Dimension, which has an inventory of 12 slots. In addition, things can be put into and taken from the shadow dimension through other Magician's Chests, the Magician's Top Hat, and Shadow Chester. Edible items in the shadow dimension rot 1.5 times faster. The Magician's Chest cannot store irreplaceable items, like the Celestial Orb. If the container is destroyed, the items remain inside the shadow dimension. In order to gain access to them again, a player must build another container to access the shadow dimension. There is only one shadow dimension per server: one on the Surface and one in Caves (due to Caves being a separate server).

Unlike the Magician's Top Hat, the Magician's Chest can be used by all characters.

The Lightning Conductor is a craftable Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together introduced in Return of Them. It is found in the Seafaring Filter and requires 5 Gold Nuggets to craft, and a Think Tank to prototype.

The Lightning Conductor can be deployed on a Mast or Winged Sail. The equipped mast acts as a Lightning Rod, diverting lightning with the same protection radius and emitting light when charged. It is mutually exclusive with (i.e. cannot be used at the same time as) a Deck Illuminator.

## Skins
In Don't Starve Together, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the Belongings page.

# Marotter Den

Exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, the Marotter Den is a Boat-like structure found floating around the Coast of the Ocean, in Shallow water. It consists of a Den and a boat platform underneath.

## Structure Infobox

**Occupied Marotter Den:**
- **Image:** ![Marotter Den](Marotter Den.png)
- **Health (Boat):** 100
- **Drops:** Kelp Fronds Ã6
- **Repaired By:** Kelp Patch, Kelp Fronds
- **Perk:** Regenerates health over time.
- **Spawn Code:** "boat_otterden"

**Empty Marotter Den:**
- **Image:** ![Marotter Den Empty](Marotter Den Empty.png)
- **Health:** 350
- **Drops:** Kelp Fronds Ã2 (75%), Kelp Patch (75%), Kelp Patch (50%), Barnacles (50%), Barnacles (25%)
- **CanBeBurned:** 1
- **Spawns:** Marotter
- **Spawn Code:** "otterden"

## Quotes

**Empty Marotter Den:**
- Wilson: "Otter den that, there's not much else there."
- Willow: "Looks empty. Might as well torch it."
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang see nothing to get."

**Marotter Den with stuff:**
- Wilson: "I otter have a closer look."
- Willow: "I should take whatever's in there. Then torch it."
- Wolfgang: "Ooh, maybe something for Wolfgang?"

## Details

A Marotter Den boat can be rowed or sailed around by a player like a normal boat but will begin to degrade if it exits Shallow Water. It will slowly repair itself if within Shallow Water. Crashing the boat into Sea Stacks or the edge of land will only cost health, not create a Leak. When damaged, it can be repaired by Kelp Fronds or Kelp Patch and will regenerate health over time.

When the Den is destroyed, the boat will start to degrade until it breaks.

Each Marotter Den houses 2 Marotters that will fill their dens with loot they collect around them. A Marotter Den has an internal inventory of 4 slots. Marotters will fill these slots with 1 of a given item that they enter with. However, if the Marotter Den is unloaded and the night segment of a day ends, it will instead slowly fill itself with items from an internal list, including things that a Marotter would normally be incapable of taking.

### Drops List

| Item                 | Chance |
|---------------------|--------|
| Barnacles           | 6.25%  |
| Kelp Patch          | 6.25%  |

### Description
The **Secret Bandit Camp** is an object exclusive to **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, which spawns after reading the **Bandit Stash Map**, obtainable by killing a **Masked Pig**.

After reading the Bandit Stash Map, the player's world map will open and reveal a red mark quite similar to those from **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**, somewhere near the player (in a specific range).

The camp can be dug with a **Shovel** to spawn a **Chest** and two **Peagawk Plumes**. If the player opens the chest, they will find rare/valuable items, such as long conservation **food**, **Gold**, **Armor**, and **Oinc**s. The chest will always contain one of 6 combination of items.

- Wheeler: "A tree made of tubers! That'll be an adventure."

## Description
Tuber Trees are Plants introduced in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. They can be found in the Painted Biome and have a seasonal life cycle. In the Temperate and Humid Seasons, they will not be mature, then they will bloom in the Lush Season, finally returning to their original state once Lush Season ends.

Unlike other trees, which cannot be chopped down with an Axe, Tuber Trees can be hacked using a Machete or Luxury Machete instead. A fully grown Tuber Tree yields up to three Tubers, taking three hits with the Machete each. While regular, unripe Tubers will poison the player when eaten, Blooming Tuber yielded during the Lush Season are safe to eat.

Tuber Trees leave a stump like most trees after hacking several times (12 hits for big tree, 9 hits for small tree). As the Trees are not completely destroyed during this process, they will slowly regrow the hacked Tuber every 4 days, into the smaller version of the normal or blooming tuber tree. The stump can be dug up by a Shovel, producing a Tuber. The stumps will not regrow. Like other trees, they have a chance to be Peculiar, making them investigatable with a Magnifying Glass or Wagstaff's Spectoggles.

Tuber Trees can catch on fire. A burnt Tuber Tree can be destroyed with a Machete, producing Charcoal.

## Prototype Tips
- Due to Tuber Trees not being renewable, one should avoid triggering the lightning that Thunderbirds produce since one cannot replace the burnt Tuber Tree.

# Bed Rolls

Bed Rolls are craftable items that can be used to sleep through the night. There are two types of bed rolls: Straw Rolls and Fur Rolls.

## Usage
At dusk or night, the item can be used by dragging and dropping on a character (which causes the 'Sleep' option to appear) or by right-clicking them from the inventory. The character will place it on the ground and lie down, and time will advance to the beginning of the next day. When going to sleep in a bed roll, the character takes an immediate hunger penalty. If the hunger penalty causes hunger to reduce to 0, the character will lose health in their sleep. Considering that this item allows a player to skip the dusk/night sanity loss, this makes the bed roll's sanity benefits even more pronounced.

Bed rolls cannot be used in "dangerous" situations, such as near a Spider Nest, in a Marsh (if Tentacles are nearby, as any Tentacles count as dangerous mobs even if they're under the surface), during combat, when monsters are nearby, and when Hounds or Depths Worms are approaching. This also includes Shadow Creatures.

Bed Rolls are unusable by Wickerbottom due to her insomnia.

## Straw Roll

### Details
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Name**: Straw Roll
- **Image**: Straw Roll Dropped.png
- **Icon**: Straw Roll.png
- **Tier**: 1
- **Tab**: Survival
- **Ingredients**: 
  - Ingredient1: Cut Grass (multiplier1: 6)
  - Ingredient2: Rope (multiplier2: 1)
- **Burn Time**: 3 min.
- **Stack**: 10
- **Hunger Restored**: -75 (on use)
- **Sanity Restored**: 33 (on use)
- **Spawn Code**: "bedroll_straw"
- **Perk**: Lets the character skip through the night
- **Dropped By**: Shipwrecked icon: Slotmachine Steamer Trunk
- **Durability**: 1 use
- **Description**: Sleep through the night.

The Straw Roll is a one-time use survival item that can be used to skip dusk and night. Using it restores 33 sanity but consumes 75 hunger. Additionally, it will set the user's temperature to 15. It requires 6 Cut Grass and 1 Rope to craft and a Science Machine to prototype. A Straw Roll can be used to craft a Fur Roll, which has multiple uses. The player is also immune to any damage during the sleep animation. A Straw Roll burns longer than the sum of its components (360 seconds versus 270 seconds, respectively, when used in a Fire Pit).

## Fur Roll

### Details
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Name**: Fur Roll
- **Image**: Fur Roll Dropped.png
- **Icon**: Fur Roll.png
- **Tier**: 2
- **Tab**: Survival
- **Ingredients**: 
  - Ingredient1: Straw Roll (multiplier1: 1)
  - Ingredient2: Bunny Puff (multiplier2: 2)
- **Burn Time**: 3 min.
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Hunger Restored**: -75 (on use)
- **Sanity Restored**: 50 (on use)
- **HP Restored**: 30 (on use)
- **Name**: Fur Roll
- **Perk**: Lets the character skip through the night.
- **Durability**: 3 uses
- **Spawn Code**: "bedroll_furry"
- **Description**: Sleep through the night in comfort!

The Fur Roll is a survival item that can be used to sleep through Dusk and Night, restoring Sanity and Health. It requires 1 Straw Roll, 2 Bunny Puffs to make, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. It is similar to the Straw Roll; however, the Straw Roll is single use, while the Fur Roll can be used until it runs out of durability. The player is, like with the Straw Roll, immune to any damage during the sleep animation.

The Fur Roll can be used three times. Using it restores 50 Sanity and 30 Health but consumes 75 hunger. Additionally, it will set the user's temperature to maximum, which is useful during winter.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, the behavior changes so that upon the Fur Roll's use, if the sleeper's temperature is below 35, it will be set to 35, but if it is above 52.5, it will increase by 17.5, making it dangerous to use in the heat of Summer when overhe

# Ice Maker 3000

The **Ice Maker 3000** is a **Science Tab** structure that can be built in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is powered by **Fuel** items. When fueled, it spits out **Ice** once every 30 seconds. If the machine runs out of fuel before 30 seconds pass since the last Ice production, the machine will turn off and no additional Ice will be produced until the machine is fueled again, and the additional fuel is wasted. It holds a maximum of 90 seconds of fuel, and each fuel item added increases the working duration equal to their burn time in a **Campfire**. This means a maximum of 6 **Twigs** or 2 **Logs** can be put into the machine at any one time.

- **Woodlegs**: 'Tis chuggin' along.
- **Wilba**: 'TIS A MAKER O' ICE
- **Wormwood**: Cold Spitter
- **Wheeler**: I'm used to making ice the old fashioned way. By freezing water.
- **Choose**: Wendy

### Tips
- Combined with a big enough **Tree** Farm, and some snake-infested **Viney Bushes** or **Spider Dens**, this machine can completely nullify hunger problems by making **Meatballs**.
- If a **Crock Pot** recipe does not allow **twigs** for its filler, but does allow frozen items, players can use Twigs as fuel in the Ice Maker 3000 to convert it into ice at a 2:1 ratio. However, 6 Twigs are the maximum amount of fuel allowed in an Ice Maker 3000, and the process is going to take some time.

### Trivia
- The Ice-Maker 3000's **Crafting** description is a reference to a song from 1989, **Ice Ice Baby**.

### Bugs
- When **Hammer**ing the Ice Maker 3000, it will appear invisible.
- If the player fuels the Ice Maker (at least enough for 1 **Ice**) and goes a good distance away for some time, the Ice Maker will produce as many Ice offscreen as the corresponding time (6 minutes = 12 Ice) without spending its current fuel, despite it being at maximum capacity. However, it will return to its normal running fuel-timer when the player returns to it.

## Description
Charcoal is an item obtained by burning down a tree or by killing Krampus. It burns at the same rate as logs when used in a campfire or fire pit but can stack up to 40 rather than 20. It is used to construct a Drying Rack or a Crock Pot, and is also used to craft Fire Darts, Boomerangs, and Gunpowder.

## Gathering
Charcoal is made by setting a tree on fire using a torch and then chopping the tree down once it has finished burning. Each burned tree yields 1 Charcoal when chopped regardless of how big it is. For efficiency, multiple trees can be planted close together, given time to grow into a small tree, and then ignited.

## Usage
- **Drying Rack**: Requires 2 Charcoal, 3 Twigs, 3 Rope, and a Science Machine.
- **Crock Pot**: Requires 6 Charcoal, 3 Cut Stone, 6 Twigs, and a Science Machine.
- **Fire Dart**: Requires Charcoal, 2 Cut Reeds, and a Crimson Feather, crafted with a Science Machine.
- **Boomerang**: Requires Charcoal, Silk, and Boards, crafted with an Alchemy Engine.
- **Gunpowder**: Requires Charcoal, a Rotten Egg, and Nitre, crafted with an Alchemy Engine.
- **Feather Pencil**: Requires Charcoal, a Jet Feather, and Twigs, crafted with a Science Machine, available in the Hamlet DLC.

# Sand Castles

## Overview
Sand Castles are craftable **Structures** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They are found under the **Structures Tab**, require 4 **Sand**, 2 **Palm Leaves**, and 3 **Seashells** and are always available to craft.

## Structure Info
- **Image**: Sand Castle Build.png
- **Icon**: Sand Castle.png
- **Ingredients**:
  - **Sand**: 4
  - **Palm Leaf**: 2
  - **Seashell**: 3
- **Tab**: Structures
- **Tier**: 0
- **Sanity Restored**: +25/min
- **Spawn Code**: "sand_castle"
- **Description**: Therapeutic and relaxing.
- **Durability**: 1 day

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: It's a sandcastle, in the sand!
- **Willow**: It's cute, I guess.
- **Wolfgang**: Good for stomping!
- **Wendy**: I suppose this diversion brings some comfort.
- **WX-78**: IT'S A STRANGELY PLEASING STRUCTURE
- **Wickerbottom**: I modeled it after a classic European castellum.
- **Wigfrid**: A scale model of my future keep.
- **Woodie**: Who knew sand could look so good.
- **Maxwell**: I found that wholly unenjoyable. I swear.
- **Wagstaff**: Fascinating, it seems to add protection against psychic attack.
- **Webber**: Look what we built!
- **Walani**: I feel like a kid again!
- **Warly**: How calming.
- **Woodlegs**: No pirate can make a better sandcastle than ol' Woodlegs!
- **Wilba**: LOOKETH OKAY TO MINE EYES
- **Wormwood**: Made that
- **Wheeler**: Why have real adventures when I can play adventures in the sand?

## Additional Information
- A Sand Castle increases **Sanity** when standing nearby, however it only lasts a single **Day**, so it is best to place it when the player will be near it for a significant period of time. When the day is over and the Sand Castle decays, it will drop 1 **Sand**, 1 **Seashell** and 1 **Palm Leaf** (This no longer is the case. When the day is over, the sandcastle disappears leaving nothing behind). It cannot be set on fire or destroyed with a **Hammer**, however it can be dug with a **Shovel** returning the same resources.
- Sand Castles can only be placed on barren land without any **Turfs**, but once they have been deployed it is possible to place any turfs underneath them.
- Using more than one Sand Castle is not recommended, as the overall sanity output is decreased if standing in between 2 of them, so it is only advised to pair a single castle with another sanity restoring object/item.

Perhaps she would have survived if she didn't stand next to a sandcastle for half a day; after all, her sanity was pretty high, and she could've restored it quicker by picking seashells and flowers. Hopefully, she learns from this mistake next time she plays Don't Starve: Shipwrecked and does not make it again.">

The Salt Rack is an item added during The Gorge temporary event. Can be bought from Billy for 8 Old Coins. Used to harvest salt. You can put it on a Salt Pond, after 2.5 minutes the salt will accumulate on the rope and you can collect and grind it.

It is advised to buy a salt rack as early as possible to get the salt and open the Safes. You should not put more than one rack - it will not have any practical benefit.

# Bee Box

![Bee Box](Bee Box.png)

A **Bee Box** is a craftable structure in Don't Starve that uses bees to accumulate honey that can be harvested. Bee Boxes are found in the Food Tab and require a Science Machine to prototype. It takes 1 Honeycomb, 4 Bees, and 2 Boards to build.

## Crafting

- Ingredient 1: Boards (2x)
- Ingredient 2: Honeycomb (1x)
- Ingredient 3: Bee (4x)
- Crafting Tab: Food
- Tier: 2

## Description

Store your own bees.

## Tool

Can be Hammered with a [Hammer](Tools#Hammer_Tools) to release bees and collect honey.

## Can Be Burned

Yes, it can be set on fire.

## Quotes

- Wilson: Bees!
- Willow: Come on fat bees, make me honey!
- Wolfgang: Many bees!
- Wendy: They shall labor so I can steal.

## Behavior

A Bee Box will (re)spawn a new Bee every 120 seconds up to the maximum population of 4 per box. All Bees will return to their box at dusk, but they will leave it during daytime one at a time every 15-30 seconds, depending on the length of daytime. During Winter, they won't leave the Box.

## Honey Production

The speed at which Bees gather Honey is affected by the quantity and proximity to Flowers near a Bee Box. Every time a Bee successfully pollinates 6 Flowers, it will return home and increase the Honey contained within by 1.

## Tips

- Bees are slow and can easily be outrun if aggravated.
- Equipping a Walking Cane or building a Cobblestone path to the Bee Box can prove useful.

## Trivia

- In the old science system, it used to cost 100 Research Points to craft.
- The honeycomb slot on top of Bee Boxes will appear to fill with Honey as more Honey is stored within.

# Volcano (Shipwrecked)

The **Volcano** is a naturally occurring object which can be found in the [Deep Ocean Biome](#). The map is limited to only one Volcano. It can be climbed to access the [area near the mouth of the Volcano](#). It also acts as a light source regardless of the season. The Volcano is usually found at one of the edges of the map. When the Volcano is approached, the camera zooms out until the player can see it as a whole.

## Eruptions

Soon after the [flooded](#) areas have dried up completely in [Dry Season](#), the Volcano will start to erupt. Tremors occur three times before each eruption, giving slightly more than half of a day to prepare. When the volcano erupts, [Dragoon Egg](#)s rain down from the sky, each briefly showing a shadow where it will land, and targeting areas within and slightly beyond the player's view. Dragoon Eggs deal 300 damage on direct hits to the player character and any Mobs struck.

When falling on land, Dragoon Eggs destroy most structures and set things on fire, and sometimes leave behind [Lava Pool](#)s. The Pools are a source of light and heat and will disappear less than half of a day later, leaving [Rocks](#), [Charcoal](#), [Flint](#), and [Ashes](#) behind.

When falling into the [Ocean](#), Eggs create [Big Waves](#) that damage the player's [Boat](#). As the volcano is erupting, the player's view is partially obscured with ash clouds that persist for some time after the eruption ends. During eruptions, birds stop spawning.

During each eruption, a few Dragoon Eggs remain intact enough to hatch approximately less than half a day later. During the hatching process, the Egg will make cracking noises as well as shake and jump.

Eruptions last about 30 seconds, with 1.5 days between each eruption. However, during the last days of the season, eruption frequency and duration massively increases.

The [Altar of Snackrifice](#) can be used in order to either delay the eruption or expedite it.

## Trivia

- The [Wilbur Vs. the Volcano](#) update added the ability to climb onto the Volcano.
- While the Volcano is in view, and the camera has zoomed out, the player cannot rotate the camera.
- Spawning a Volcano with the [Console](#) will not create a new place but a new entrance to the already existing Volcano's inside. The camera will not zoom out when approaching a player spawned Volcano until the game is reloaded.
- During new moons, Rainbow Jellyfish will migrate from the volcano to the center of the map. When seeing them on a new moon, go the opposite way they are to find the volcano.
- The sound effect of Dragoon Eggs falling is similar to [the sound effect of Admiral Akainu's techniques Ryusei Kazan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiHgLSifzOc) from Japanese animated series [One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece).

## Bugs

The **Sea Strider Nest** is a naturally spawning object exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in the **Waterlogged** beta. It is the home of **Sea Striders**, and can be found in the **Waterlogged** biome.

## Behavior
- Sea Striders will emerge from the nest at **Dusk** by climbing down from above in a manner similar to **Dangling Depth Dwellers**.
- During the daytime any Sea Striders that are not engaged with an enemy or pursuing food will return to their nest of origin and despawn.
- Sea Striders will also emerge to investigate when a nearby **Mossy Vine** is picked or the **Great Tree Trunk** the nest is connected to is rammed by a boat.

## Respawn and Destruction
- The max amount of Sea Striders a Nest can have could be 2 or 3.
- It takes about 2 minutes for a Nest to respawn a new Sea Strider.
- The Nest has 200 health and can be destroyed with weapons.
- Once a nest is destroyed, the Great Tree Trunk it was hanging on will spawn a new nest after 3 to 5 days.
- A Great Tree Trunk can only regrow one nest at a time, so if another nest is destroyed when there is already a nest in regrowth, it will be destroyed permanently.
- If a nest catches on fire and burns down, the Great Tree Trunk will not regrow a new nest.

# Nightmare Throne

The **Nightmare Throne** is an indestructible structure only found in the epilogue of Adventure Mode. It is a black throne with many spikes, which traps whoever is sitting on it. Attacking it will break the player's weapon and hit them with a weak Lightning bolt.

## Maxwell's Quotes
When players approach Maxwell in the throne, he will say a line. Players have to click on him to read all the lines. Once he says all the lines listed below, excluding the Gramaphone ones, all he will say is "...".

- "Is this what you were expecting?" / "Is this how it ends?"
- "Forgive me if I don't get up."
- "You've been an interesting plaything, but I've grown tired of this game."
- "Or maybe They've grown tired of me."
- "Heh. Took them long enough."
- "They'll show you terrible, beautiful things."
- "It's best not to fight it."
- "There wasn't much here when I showed up."
- "Just dust. And the Void. And Them."
- "I've learned so much since then. I've built so much."
- "But even a King is bound to the board."
- "You can't change the rules of the game."
- "I don't know what they want. They... they just watch."
- "Unless you get too close... Then..."
- "Well, there's a reason I stay so dapper."
- "What year is it out there? Time moves differently here."
- "Go on, stay a while. Keep us company."
- "Or put the key in the box. It's your decision."
- "Either way, you're just delaying the inevitable."
- "Reality is like that, sometimes."
- "I think I've said enough."

If the Gramaphone is turned off, then Maxwell will say: "Thank you, I've been listening to that song for an eternity." If the Gramaphone is then turned back on, Maxwell then states: "I suppose I deserve that." If the player activates the hidden Teleportato, Maxwell will say: "Don't you think I've tried that?", followed by "This is the end of the line. We have no escape." If the player attacks Maxwell, he will say: "The throne won't allow that. I've tried."

## Trivia

- There was an older design for the Nightmare Throne that appeared in the game. However, it was removed and replaced with the current one. The Shadow Key originally was going to unlock Maxwell, but the Divining Rod replaced it.
- There is a fully operational Wooden Thing located somewhere in the map. Players can try to use it, but it will simply drop them back at Maxwell's throne. Maxwell will comment that he tried the same.
- It's possible to see two of the same character by playing Adventure Mode twice as that character. One of them will be stuck on the throne, while the second has the option to swap places.
- Maxwell's 7th line used to be: "It will change you, like it did me."
- According to a Rhymes with Play livestream, "between zero and zero" people sat on the Shadow Throne before Maxwell (meaning that he was the first to sit on the Throne), but that many people came after him.
- When Maxwell is on the Nightmare Throne, it may seem like he cannot be killed thanks to the lightning removing your weapon. However, Maxwell actually has 10,000,000 health and it's possible to kill him, but it serves no purpose.
- It is possible for the player to kill Maxwell using WX-78. Since WX regenerates health (but loses sanity) with lightning, a player will only need to hit Maxwell for an enormous period of time until he dies, but you will be bothered by Nightmare Creatures afterwards.
- When finishing the adventure mode with Wagstaff and then reaching the epilogue again, he will no longer be on the Nightmare Throne. This is because Wagstaff himself is not really in the Constant.
- While many characters retain their usual appearance when bound to the Nightmare Throne, Maxwell will revert back to his NPC appearance on the throne if he is the one to complete Adventure Mode.

## Bugs

- When trying to attack Maxwell while on the throne as Woodie using Lucy the Axe, Lucy will be destroyed. If Woodie pities Maxwell and takes his place, upon being strapped to the throne, the throne will be turned around. This same glitch can happen to Willow if the player used the Console to complete Adventure Mode.
- If Bigfoot is summoned to smash Maxwell while he's on the Nightmare Throne, the game will crash.

# Mini Sign

# Exclusivity: Don't Starve Together

## Event: Year of the Beefalo

### Competing in a Beefalo Pageant
Competing in a Beefalo Pageant is the only method of obtaining **Lucky Gold Nugget**s during the event. It can be initiated by hitching a **Beefalo** at a **Beefalo Stage** and talking to the judge at the **Judge's Booth** during the day. Only one contest can occur each day. At least 4 **Beefalo Stages** are required to start the pageant. If there are not enough players to **Beefalo Stages**, the extra stages will be occupied with **Merm** and **Pig** competitors with their own Beefalo. To initiate a pageant, all participating players have to hitch their beefalo to a **Beefalo Stage**. Beefalo cannot be hitched to anything if they are in heat. Once all participating beefalos are hitched, a player has to activate the **Judge's Booth**.

### Judge's Booth
The **Judge's Booth** is a crafted item from the **Offerings Filter**, made with 4 **Boards**, 2 **Beefalo Wool**, and 2 **Gold Nuggets**. It is used to start **Beefalo Pageants**. It has to be set up by the player within range of the **Beefalo Stages** in order to start a pageant.

- **Wurt**: Has weird scale-less hiding inside.
- **Walter**: Let's win some prizes, Woby!
- **Wanda**: What a strange fellow. A shame he doesn't pop by more often.

### Beefalo Stage
The **Beefalo Stage** is a crafted item from the **Offerings Filter**, made with two **Boards** and one **Gold Nugget**. The player must hitch their bonded **Beefalo** to in order to enter a **Beefalo Pageant**. It has to be set up by the player within range of the **Judge's Booth** in order to start a pageant.

# Tools

Tools are some of the first **Items** that can be **Crafted**. They are used to harvest new types of resources which cannot otherwise be obtained. The **Axe** is often the first Tool to be made, which allows **Trees** to be chopped down for **Logs**. Tools are equipped in the hand slot (except the razor) and are used to perform actions that cannot be done by hand (such as Mining with the **Pickaxe**), and some multitask. Most Tools can also be used as weapons during the first few days before better ones are obtained. The **Tools Tab** with the crossed Axe and Pickaxe icon on the left-hand side of the screen lists which Tools can currently be crafted. The **Axe** and the **Pickaxe** are available from Day 1 while the others must first be prototyped with a **Science Machine**. The **Shovel**, **Hammer**, **Pitchfork**, **Razor** and the **Feather Pencil** are prototyped from the **Science Machine**. **Luxury Axe**s, **Regal Shovel**s and **Opulent Pickaxe**s, as well as all Items required to domesticate and ride **Beefalo**, are prototyped from the **Alchemy Engine**.

All tools have durability (except the Razor) which determines how many times they may be used before breaking. The Luxury Axe, Regal Shovel, and Opulent Pickaxe are special versions which have 4 times greater durability than their normal counterparts.

## Downloadable Content

In all **DLC**s, the Hammer is craftable right from the start of the game and requires **Cut Grass** instead of **Rope**.

In the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, the player can craft **Machete**s and **Luxury Machete**s in the Tools Tab.

In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, both Machetes and Luxury Machetes are also available, alongside **Shears**.

## Trivia

* Thorny Buoy has an unused Thorny Buoy Kit. You can spawn it using a command and use it just like a regular Golden Buoy Kit. Apparently this item is in the game files only so that they fit into Charlie's Racer inventory so they can use them during races.
