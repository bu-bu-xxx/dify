# Clockwork Knight

The Clockwork Knight is a hostile Mob that protects the Wooden Thing in Sandbox Mode or certain places in Adventure Mode. It also spawns from a mined Maxwell Statue in the Adventure Mode chapter, Epilogue. It is one of the Chess Monsters guarding the Chess Biome.

## Behavior

A Knight's main purpose is to guard the Wooden Thing. They are seen sleeping near it along with some Clockwork Bishops and a Clockwork Rook. When a mob or the player gets close, the Knight will stand up and stare at the creature, and if the creature gets close enough, the Knight will do a war cry and charge at it, using its springy neck to headbutt when it gets close. The Knight will then attempt to kite. If the knight is followed, it will usually try to headbutt once more, then it will do its war cry again. The Knight cannot be stun-locked and does not respawn.

## Hunting

Unlike other Chess Pieces, there is nothing spectacular in a Clockwork Knight's abilities and it is overall the easiest one to defeat. The easiest way to kill Knights is by kiting them. When in groups, it is recommended to separate one from the rest of the group, killing it, then separating another. As they usually do their battle cry before attempting to attack again, players may find it effective to attack a Knight while it is doing this, then backing away as soon as it tries to headbutt the player.

Befriending at least 5 Pigs can easily kill all the Knights and other Clockwork Monsters around the Wooden Thing. Alternatively, the attacks of the Clockwork Rook will damage them. With a bit of timing and luck, a Rook can be used to destroy the other Clockwork Monsters. When trying to kill a Knight for its Gears, a death by fire will cause it to drop Ashes.

# Aporkalypse

The **Aporkalypse** is a major world event in *Don't Starve: Hamlet* DLC that occurs when all three sigils on the **Aporkalypse Calendar** align. Without outside influence, this happens on the start of the 61st day in a *Hamlet* world, time enough that one would go through each season twice before the Aporkalypse. During this event, the world will be bathed in constant red light as the result of an annular eclipse, and the player is completely immune to **Charlie** out of **Interiors**. Many creatures and aspects of the game change, getting much more difficult. The Aporkalypse lasts forever until the player reverses the Aporkalypse Calendar for the first time, then it lasts for 20 days if the player doesn't reverse the Aporkalypse Calendar the next time the Aporkalypse is triggered.

Pigs in Swinesbury and the Palace City will warn of the upcoming Aporkalypse about 7 days before it begins, saying "Doomsday is near!", "Fear and porktent!", "Porktentous figures!", "Something wicked this way comes!", "The aporkalypse approach-eth" and, "Woe, destruction, and decay!". This will replace their regular trading requests; however, they will still accept goods in exchange for oincs.

## Effects

- There will no longer be any day or dusk **Day-Night Cycle** periods, only night, meaning sanity will constantly drain when outside of any **Interiors**.
- **Food** will spoil 50% faster.
- **Trees** take 50% longer time to grow to next stage.
- The environment changes drastically.
  - The "Moon" will transform into a constant blood red **Full Moon**.
    - All regular **Flowers** turn into **Evil Flower**s. This does not affect **Exotic Flowers**.
    - All **Mushrooms** will turn into **Mushtree**s.
    - **Woodie** will become a Werebeaver at the start of every 'day'.
    - **Wilba** will become a Werepig at the start of every 'day'.
  - The player will be unable to see the shadows of **Vampire Bat**s and **BFB** form before they spawn. However, they will be able to see their model and other models darken as the **BFB**'s shadow flies above them.
- **Pig**s will stop most of their activities.
  - All shops become locked and **Pig Traders** will not leave their houses, as per usual for nighttime.
  - **Royal Guards** will no longer patrol, and will stay inside at all times, except if they notice the player stealing in their proximity.
  - **Worker Pigs** will not repair any damaged structure.
  - **Lamp Posts** are perpetually on, but the **Lamp**s found in the **Mant Hill** will no longer emit light.
- Many creatures have their behaviors changed. All creatures that can sleep at night will do so until attacked, and creatures asleep during the day will be awake constantly.
  - All **Mant**s hatch into **Mant Warriors**. The new Mant Warriors now glow, emitting a very dim light that spreads across a large distance. Any new Mants spawned by the **Antcomb Home** automatically turn into Mant Warriors.
  - **Pogs** become evil and attack any Survivors or critters in sight.
  - **Pikos** and Orange Pikos turn rabid.
  - **Iron Hulk** pieces are perpetually activated.
  - **Vampire Bat** attacks become much more common and much more severe, happening nearly every day. The amount of bats that spawns is greatly increased. It is common to find upwards of 10 Vampire Bats in an attack during the Aporkalypse on Day 1.
  - The **BFB** will not spawn during this time, and if summoned, will land and take off immediately, as per usual for nighttime.
  - **Thunderbirds** will launch 10 Lightning Bolts instead of 3.
  - **Elder Mandrakes** become neutral, start to smile and can now be befriended with raw **Vegetables**.
- Anywhere from 2-5 **Ancient Spirits** spawn in every room of every **Ancient Pig Ruins**. If all ghosts in the room are killed, new ghosts will spawn when returning to the room.
- The boss monster **Ancient Herald** spawns shortly after the Aporkalypse begins out of any Interiors. If killed, it will respawn in a short time.

## Strategy

This event is treacherous, with a constant sanity drain, many many bats,

# Removed Features in Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together

The following features were once officially implemented in **Don't Starve** or **Don't Starve Together**, but have since been removed from the games for various reasons.

## Bonfire
The **Bonfire** is a removed **Structure**. **Pigs** used to spawn at Bonfires, before they were replaced by **Pig Houses**. They automatically started at **Night**, however, the **Fire** did not cast any light. The player was able to cook **Food** over a Bonfire even when it was not lit. Its spawn code was `"bonfire"`.

![Bonfire](bonfire.png)
![Bonfire Night](bonfirenight.png)
![Provefire](provefire.png)
![During Day](duringday.png)
![At Night](atnight.png)
![Bonfire Model](bonfiremodel.png)
![Bonfire Animation](bonfireanimation.gif)

## Barrel
The **Barrel** is a removed object found in the **Caves**, that used to spawn **Splumonkeys**. When destroyed with a **Hammer**, it dropped two **Cave Bananas**, 2 **Manure** and sometimes a **Gnome**. The Barrel was also flammable. As of **A Moderately Friendly Update**, the Barrel was removed, and replaced with the **Splumonkey Pod**. Its spawn code was `"monkeybarrel"`.

![Barrel](Barrel.png)

## Deadly Feast
The **Deadly Feast** is a removed **Food** item that would instantly kill most characters when consumed. It was used as a way to escape **Adventure Mode** before the epilogue was fully implemented. Its spawn code was `"deadlyfeast"`.

![Meaty Stew](MeatyStew.png)
![Epilogue Early Version](Epilogueearlyversion.png)

## Farm Plot
The **Farm Plot** was a feature in beta versions of **Don't Starve** and it required 6 Grass and 8 Manure to craft without any science. It was a slower version of the basic farm.

![Farm Plot](Farmplot.PNG)
![Farm Plot 2](Farmplot2.PNG)
![CD Farm Plot](CDfarmplot.png) - Original HD icon from Bonus Materials from **CD Don't Starve**.

## Gemology Tab
**Gemology** was a crafting tab used to make the various **Gem**-based items in the game. The recipes from the tab still exist, but they have since been split between the **Magic Tab** and the **Ancient Tab**. They included **Life Giving Amulet**, **Chilled Amulet**, **Nightmare Amulet**, **The Lazy Forager**, **Fire Staff**, **Ice Staff**, **Telelocator Staff**, **Star Caller's Staff** and **Telelocator Focus**.

![Gemology](Gemology.png)

## All Game Tabs
Since the March 2022 QoL Update, Crafting Tabs have been replaced with Filter in the game. So now Crafting Tabs in **Don't Starve Together** are removed.

## Details
- Spoiled Fish is an item introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. Dead **Dogfish** and Dead **Swordfish** will turn into Spoiled Fish instead of **Rot** if left to spoil. It is also possible to pick one up in a **Trawl Net**. Giving **Packim Baggims** a Dead Dogfish or a Dead Swordfish will result in it spitting out a Spoiled Fish. Spoiled Fish can be **Hammer**ed to get 2 **Bone Shards**.
- In the **Hamlet** DLC, Spoiled Fish is dropped upon killing the **Pugalisk**.

## Tips
- In **Shipwrecked**, Bone Shards stack up to 20, but Spoiled Fish stack up to 40 and each can be hammered for two Bone Shards. This makes it more space efficient to store Spoiled Fish.

# Prefabs

Prefabs, or pre-fabricated, are objects in the game. This lists the codes used in DebugSpawn.

To use them, open the console with tilde (~) and enter `DebugSpawn("'spawncode'")`.

All tables on this page are sortable by name. Just click the up/down arrows in the column header to change sort attributes from ascending to descending and back. Each table also has a "Collapse" button in the "**Prefab**" column header. Clicking this will temporarily hide that table from view, which can help make page navigation easier. The tables are expanded by default to allow for quick page searching using your browser's "Find" or "Find on page" command.

_Tables of contents are automatically generated and cannot be represented in Markdown. Hence, they are omitted below._

## Spawning Items

There are two approaches in spawning items:

### Using `c_spawn` in Console

It spawns an item or a mob at the position of mouse click immediately.

- Spawn a mob - 1 [[Beefalo]].
  ```
  c_spawn("beefalo")
  ```
- Spawn multiple mobs - 2 [[Deerclops]].
  ```
  c_spawn("deerclops",2)
  ```
- Spawn an item - 1 [[Gears]].
  ```
  c_spawn("gears")
  ```
- Spawn multiple items - 2 [[Fire Staff]].
  ```
  c_spawn("firestaff",2)
  ```
- Spawn a structure - 1 [[Science Machine]].
  ```
  c_spawn("researchlab")
  ```
- Spawn multiple structures - 2 [[Science Machine]].
  ```
  // Only a single structure can be spawned at once.
  ```

### Using `c_give` in Console

It directly gives an item to the player's inventory immediately.

- Spawn an item - 1 [[Meaty Stew]].
  ```
  c_give("bonestew",1)
  ```
- Spawn multiple items - 2 [[Walking Cane]].
  ```
  c_give("cane",2)
  ```

# Morgue

The **Morgue** is accessible from the save slot selection menu (next to the cancel button). It compiles data about the characters that have **died**, whether permanently or not, in descending order of time spent alive. The Morgue details:

- **Days Lived**: Counts how many total days the character has survived in that mode.
- **Deceased**: Displays the character's portrait.
- **Cause of Death**: Lists the cause of death with mob names taken from the game files.
- **Mode**: Indicates the mode in which the character died (Survival, Adventure, or Caves).

## Days Lived
- In **Survival Mode**, the number of days lived will match the day the in-game clock read upon death.
- In **Caves**, it counts the total number of days spent underground.

For example:
- If a player starts a new world in Survival Mode and dies on day 10, the Obituary will list "10" under Days Lived.
- If the player is revived and dies again on day 30, the column will read "30" instead of "20".
- If the player enters a Cave on day 50 and dies on the 10th day underground, the Obituary will have "10" for Days Lived.
- A death on day 70 back on the surface will be listed as "70", as days elapsed in Caves count.

## Trivia
- The Morgue feature was added in **[The Stuff of Nightmares](#)**.
- Death by the **Night Monster** is listed as "Darkness", but when playing as **Maxwell**, the cause of death is listed as "Charlie".
- Deaths caused by means unknown to the morgue (including mod entities) are listed as "Shenanigans". This name also appears when resurrected via `c_godmode()` with commands.
- Death by too many Meat Effigies is listed as "Resurrection Sickness".
- If a character dies via a returning **Boomerang**, the character's name is shown under cause of death.
- Death by **Earthquakes** in Caves will have its cause listed as the name of the item that killed the player.
- Death by the Magma at the center of the **Volcano** in the **Shipwrecked** DLC is listed as "Burnt", despite it being very unlikely to occur in regular gameplay.

# Strong Winds

**Strong Winds** are a naturally occurring event in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They are most common in **Hurricane Season** but can occasionally happen in **Mild Season** as well. Strong Winds signal that it might start **raining** soon. They can also be summoned by the **Howling Conch**.

## Effects

- Movement is slowed down when running or sailing against the winds.
- Many items are also blown along in the direction of the wind, potentially off the coast.
- Floating objects stay ashore and can be retrieved from the shoreline.
- Strong Winds may rarely cut harvestable plants such as **Saplings**, **Grass Tufts**, **Bamboo Patches**, and **Viney Bushes**. This will cause their resources to drop and they will turn into their harvested states.
- Strong winds can erode and destroy **Wood Walls** and **Hay Walls**.
- They also can break **Palm Trees** and **Jungle Trees**, which can result in spawning unexpected **Palm Treeguards** or **Snakes** (including poisonous snakes) respectively.

Different items on the ground are affected differently by the wind. Light objects like **Hail**, **Palm Leaves**, and **Seeds** slide away very fast, while heavier objects like **Coconuts** are less affected and other even heavier objects like **Rocks** and **Logs** barely move at all, depending on the wind strength. **Backpacks**, **Tools**, and most other player **crafted** **items** are unaffected by wind.

Items that can be affected by Strong Winds:

* **Azure Feather**, **Crimson Feather**, **Jet Feather**, **Thunder Feather** - All kinds of **Feathers** (light)
* **Batilisk Wing**, **Drumstick**, **Meat**, **Monster Meat**, **Morsel**, **Leafy Meat**, **Flytrap Stalk** - All **Meats** (medium)
* **Carrot** - (light)
* **Berries** - (light)
* **Seeds** and **Crop Seeds** - (light)
* **Blue Cap**, **Green Cap**, **Red Cap** - (light)
* **Butterfly Wings** - (light)
* **Charcoal** - (light)
* **Cut Grass** - (light)
* **Cut Reeds** - (light)
* **Petals** and **Dark Petals** - (light)

## Hamlet

The Strong Winds are also included in the **Hamlet** DLC. The Strong Winds only occur naturally during the **Lush Season**, and not accompanied by rain. **Rainforest Trees** can be influenced by Strong Winds, and may drop a **Jungle Burr** (which can be planted to grow a new Tree) if the Strong Winds start to blow. It can also push dropped items off the edge.

## Tips

- A **Sleek Hat** provides 50% protection against the wind's slowing effect, while a **Windbreaker** completely nullifies it.

## Bugs

- After Strong Winds end, items may randomly be pushed around land and even into the **Ocean**.

# Lush Season in Don't Starve: Hamlet

## Exclusivity: Hamlet

Lush Season is the third season in Don't Starve: Hamlet, following the **Humid Season**. It is characterized by brambles and allergies. Most plants change their texture to bloom during this season. With standard settings, it starts on day 23 and ends on day 36. The beginning of the season is marked by rare gusts of wind.

## Seasonal Features

### Tuber Trees and Blooming Tubers
During the flowering season, **Tuber Trees** begin to bloom, indicated by the presence of greenery and flowers on the tree. When chopping a tree in this season, **Blooming Tubers** drop out instead of the usual **Tuber**, which does not poison the character when eaten.

### Brambles and Allergies
When the flowering season arrives, brambles appear in several biomes. They often simply block paths, but can be dispersed at the cost of 3 damage to the character per hit. **Wormwood** can absorb this damage with a **Bramble Husk**. Blooming brambles can be found in the **Bramble Bloom**, and its **Bramble Bulb** can be used to create a **Dense Turf**.

### Hay Fever
Pollen causes **Hay Fever**. During the pollen period, the screen becomes cloudy from the edges to the center; after the character sneezes, the screen clears a bit. When a character sneezes, a random item drops out of the inventory, as if taking damage from a frog or creeper, and sanity decreases. To avoid allergies, create a **Gas Mask**, eat **Nettles** (preferably **Meated Nettles**), and **Seed Pod**.

## Seasonal Changes

* **Brambles** begin to grow across various biomes in the world.
* **Bramble Blooms** will appear around brambles in the world.
* The player is vulnerable to **Hay Fever**, which can be prevented by wearing a **Gas Mask**, consuming **Seed Pods**, **Nettles** or **Nettle Rolls**, or being near a working **Oscillating Fan**.
* **Strong Winds** will occasionally blow during this season.
* **Tuber Trees** bloom during the Lush Season, allowing **Blooming Tubers** to be consumed without the poisoning effect from eating Tubers procured during the Temperate and Humid seasons.
* **Rainforest Trees** also bloom in the Lush season, and will drop **Jungle Burrs** (the equivalent of **Pine Cones**) when **Strong Winds** blow or they are chopped down. This allows the player to replant another tree, making Rainforest Trees renewable only in this season.
* **Wormwood** will start to bloom.

## Unlocking
Wagstaff was added to ''[[Don't Starve]]'' with the release of ''[[Hamlet]]''. He is unlocked from the start alongside [[Wilson]].

## Tinkering
{{Main|Tinkering Tab}}
Wagstaff has access to a unique crafting tab, [[Tinkering Tab|Tinkering]], which allows him to create various goggles and inventions. All goggles grant Wagstaff the ability to see normally, and in ''[[Hamlet]]'', negate the effects of [[Heavy Fog]] and allow Wagstaff to identify [[Peculiar Objects]]; However, other survivors will instead become nearsighted while wearing them.

| Gadget | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| {{Pic|64|Spectoggles}} | Equipped in the Head slot. Allows Wagstaff to see normally (other survivors instead become nearsighted), indicates hidden dangers such as [[Tentacle]]s, and used as a crafting ingredient in making other goggles. Durability of 10 days. |
| {{Pic|64|Infroggles}} | Equipped in the Head slot. Allows Wagstaff to see normally and grants infrared vision (other survivors cannot use infrared), which also prevents [[Charlie]] from attacking. Durability of 2 days. |
| {{Pic|64|Visor}} | Equipped in the Head slot. Allows Wagstaff to see normally, has 600 durability, and absorbs 85% of physical damage. However, vision is reduced to a small rectangle in the center of the screen. |
| {{Pic|64|Fryfocals}} | Equipped in the Head slot. Allows Wagstaff to see normally (albeit with a sepia filter), and can shoot fireballs that deal -50 {{hp}} and set mobs on fire. Durability of 10 uses. |
| {{Pic|64|Telebrella}} | Short-ranged teleportation device that warps the user to the nearest [[Telipad]], though it has a limited range, and deals 17 damage per hit if used as a melee weapon. In DLCs, it grants +35% [[Wetness]] resistance while equipped. Durability of 10 uses. |
| {{Pic|64|Telipad}} | Receiver pad used in conjunction with the [[Telebrella]]. |
| {{Pic|64|Thumper}} | When activated, creates a shockwave that destroys nearby [[Structure]]s, [[Boulder]]s, and [[Tree]]s, and uproots plants. Deals -30 {{hp}} to entities caught in the shockwave. |
| {{Pic|64|Electrical Doodad}} | In the vanilla game, used as a crafting ingredient in other inventions. |

## Disadvantages
* Wagstaff is nearsighted. Unless he is wearing one of his goggles, everything beyond 4 units of distance appears blurry, and objects in that radius cannot be identified (with there being unique names and voicelines for blurry objects). Because goggles must be worn at all times, Wagstaff's Head slot is generally occupied and means he cannot use other useful Head-slot items.
* Wagstaff also has an intestinal disease that leaves him with a delicate stomach, and will take -3 {{hp}} every time he consumes raw or dried food. This does not override any Health restored by eating such food, meaning that raw or dried foods that restore Health will still grant a Health bonus, albeit a reduced one.

## {{pic|32|Prototype}} Tips
* A good place to base as Wagstaff is at the [[Pig King]], as the [[pig]]s can be killed for both [[Pig Skin]], used to make Spectoggles, and meat to give to the Pig King for [[Gold]], which is also used to craft Spectoggles.
* The Fryfocals will not lose durability when equipped and not used in combat, so not using them as a weapon can effectively give you unlimited sight if you don't mind the yellow overlay it gives.
  * The Visor can also be used for unlimited sight, so long as you are not attacked and don't mind the vision reduction.

## General Information
- **Can Be Burned:** Yes
- **Image:** ![Slimy Turf Dropped](Slimy Turf Dropped.png)
- **Icon:** ![Slimy Turf](Slimy Turf.png)
- **Dropped By:** Slimy Turf tiles (![Pitchfork](Pitchfork Icon.png))
- **Stack:** 10
- **Burn Time:** 45 sec.

## Turf Properties
- **Image:** ![Slimy Turf Texture](Slimy Turf Texture.png)
- **Pitchfork:** Can be dug up
- **Plantable:** Yes

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** "Yet another ground type."
- **Wendy:** "Some ground."
- **Wickerbottom:** "The ground. You step on it."
- **Maxwell:** "Turf."
- **Wagstaff:** "Has a high viscosity."
- **Webber:** "Some pretty average earth."
- **Walani:** "I have a sinking feeling about this." (Chosen)
- **Warly:** "It's like an ingredient for the ground."
- **Wormwood:** "Slimy"

## Description
Slimy Turf is one of the Turf items, acquired by digging Slimy tiles with a Pitchfork. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile, or it can be used as fuel.

Slimy Turf is only found in Caves. It is one of the two Turfs that connect or surround a Sunken Forest. Sometimes, a player may find Saplings in an area covered with Slimy Turf.

Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Pine Cones, Birchnuts, and Lureplants can be placed normally on Slimy Turf, and Eyeplants will spawn normally. Crows are the only Birds that will land on Slimy Turf.

Slimy Turf has the third highest overlap priority of any turf in the game, meaning it will almost always appear "on top" when overlapping adjacent turfs. The only turfs with a higher overlap priority are Cave Rock Turf and Mud Turf.

If brought to SW, Floods can spawn on this turf.

![Experience gained at death](attachment:Newdeathscreen.png)

### Experience in Don't Starve

#### Overview
**Experience** is an in-game point system used to unlock new **Characters** in **Don't Starve**. It is awarded on the death or level transition screen, and depends on the **days survived**. Each survived day adds **20 XP**. Subsequent games add to the existing experience. Note that respawning at a **Touch Stone** or **Meat Effigy** does not give a death screen, so no experience points will be given at that point.

The days survived in **Adventure Mode** don't count on death, so surviving 3 days in **Sandbox Mode**, then going to Adventure Mode and surviving for 5 more days, then dying and return to Sandbox mode, and dying again in Sandbox mode will earn experience only for the 3 days spent in Sandbox mode. However, going to the next chapter through the **Teleportato** in Adventure Mode will give experience for the time spent in that chapter.

### Unlockable Characters via Experience

The following characters cannot be unlocked via experience: **Wes**, **Maxwell**, **Webber**, **Wilbur**, **Woodlegs**, and **Wilba**. **Wilson**, **Wagstaff**, and **Wormwood** are characters that are available from the start (Wormwood is only available if the player owns **Hamlet**, however).

In **Don't Starve Together**, all characters are available from the start except for **Wortox**, **Wormwood**, **Wurt**, and **Wanda** (unless the player owns **Hamlet**, in which case **Wormwood** will be available to the player immediately), who need to be either purchased or woven with **Spools**.

To unlock all characters in **Don't Starve** (Willow, Wolfgang, Wendy, WX-78, Wickerbottom, and Woodie), one needs to survive a total of **80 days**; in **Reign of Giants**, one needs to survive a total of **96 days** to unlock Wigfrid; in **Shipwrecked**, one needs to survive a cumulative **128 days** to unlock Walani and Warly; and finally, one needs to survive a cumulative **160 days** in **Hamlet** to unlock Wheeler.

| Character | Experience Points | Days Survived |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| [[Willow]] | 160 XP | 8 days |
| [[Wolfgang]] | 320 XP | 16 days |
| [[Wendy]] | 640 XP | 32 days |
| [[WX-78]] | 960 XP | 48 days |
| [[Wickerbottom]] | 1280 XP | 64 days |
| [[Woodie]] | 1600 XP | 80 days |
| [[Wigfrid]] | 1920 XP | 96 days |
| [[Walani]] | 2240 XP | 112 days |
| [[Warly]] | 2560 XP | 128 days |
| [[Wheeler]] | 3200 XP | 160 days |

#### Gallery

#### Trivia

- XP is capped at **1600** in the base game, **1920** in the **Reign of Giants** DLC, **2560** in the **Shipwrecked** DLC, and **3200** in the **Hamlet** DLC.
- If the player made a base game or RoG game compatible with SW or HAM, the experience accrued will count towards unlocking the respective DLC characters.

| Attribute           | Description                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Full Name          | Winona W.                                 |
| Born               | September 13, ??.                         |
| Location           | Ohio                                       |
| Favorite Food       | ![Spicy Vegetable Stinger](pic32)         |
| Curio Cabinet Bio  | Winona is a former assembly line worker with a boisterous attitude and a love of all things mechanical. |
| Motto              | "Anything can be fixed with hard work and elbow grease." |
| Friends and Relatives | [[Charlie]] (Little Sister), Father and Mother |

## Before Charlie Left

"Growing up, Winona always looked out for her younger sister. Even now, she can't help but feel that one day she'll be able to reach out into the darkness and pull Charlie back." As the story from [[Stage]] makes clear. Previously, Winona was overprotective of her younger sister [[Charlie]]. After some time, Charlie left Winona for San Francisco, where she began working as [[Maxwell]]'s assistant. Winona moved to Ohio. Then she received a letter from Charlie:

"Dear Winona,"

"How are you?! Congratulations on the new job! I knew you would find something soon. Have you settled in alright? Are you taking care of yourself?" 

"I'm still here in San Fran and things are going well. My magic act partner has taught me so much about showmanship in such a short time. I think you two would really get along! You're both very stubborn. Haha!"

"Anyway, please write back soon. I want to hear all the latest news from Ohio. Don't leave anything out!"

"OXO,"

"Charlie"

## Hitting Constant

The events of this short were later officially summarized in DST's [[Compendium]]: ![Summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Kn9tgO0mQ&list=PLXtRs5MEBxEiuAIG26uLmh3yR-ACXBfYW&index=23)

"There is nothing Winona wouldn't do for her family. When her younger sister Charlie disappeared under mysterious circumstances, Winona refused to let the case grow cold and dedicated herself to finding her. For over a decade she tracked down every clue, followed every lead, poked, prodded, and questioned anyone who might have a connection to the case, until all the loose strings started to come together. There was a [[Radio|radio factory]], founded by a [[Wagstaff|peculiar old man]] whose genius was only matched by his secretiveness, that might hold the answers she had sought for so long. Shortly after securing employment at the factory, the building was destroyed in an accident caused by a malfunctioning portal. Having caught sight of someone getting caught in the portal and vanishing, Winona hastily repaired it in the hopes of rescuing them, only to come face to face with her missing sister. Unfortunately, Charlie seemed to be held under the sway of a shadowy influence, and she dragged Winona into the Constant." 

![Behind The Scenes](RWP_229_Conspiracy_Board_Behind_The_Scenes.png "Behind The Scenes")

After [[Charlie]] went missing in 1916, Winona began an investigation. She studied [[Maxwell]]'s posters, the disappearances of many other characters (on the board you can see the portal into which [[Wes]] fell, the poster about the disappearance of [[Woodie]]), as well as the activities of [[Wagstaff]] including the world exhibition and the opening of the company. In order to get closer to the solution, she got a job at the [[Voxola]] plant, which was founded by [[Wagstaff]]. The [[Voxola]] plant that produced the RP-76 radio could not survive for long and burned down a couple of weeks after opening in 1919. On that day, destruction began at the plant. Winona was able to save [[Minor_Characters#Genny_and_Voxola_workers|Genny]]. Winona also ran to the office of the boss ([[Wagstaff]]) from where all the destruction began. There she noticed a silhouette in a mysterious portal. The man nevertheless flew into the portal, and Winona retained the glove. Then she decided to repair the portal. After activating the portal, Charlie emerged from it. Thinking Charlie was in danger, Winona tried to pull her out of the portal, but she ended up in Constant instead.

The **Void Masque** (or **Herald of Tenebrau**) is a **Shadow Aligned** mob. Like the **Slurper**, it equips itself as an item in the head slot, but its mechanics are very different from a normal mob. Rather than attack mobs or players, it possesses certain other mobs and possesses dead player characters.

## Possessed Mob and Character

## Trivia
- The player can get and equip a Void Masque mask using `c_give("shadow_thrall_parasitehat")`. With this mask, the player can also infect other creatures. This only works in a cave provided that the **Shadow Rift** is activated.
  - The mask will be invisible in the inventory and unequipping it will cause it to break.
- "Deadelgänger" is a portmanteau of the words "dead" and "doppelganger".

# Customization Options for Creating a New World

There are several customization options available when creating a new world. These customization options serve to allow the player to tweak a world to their liking. Note that setting many of the options that concern spawn rates to anything above the "default" value will cause those resources to spawn outside of their native biomes. See the page corresponding to each game world customization:

## Description
Gold Dust is a Resource introduced in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. It is obtained by mining artichoke shaped Boulders, using a Gold Pan at a Sparkling Pool, or mining Ruined Sculptures in the Ancient Pig Ruins. Six Gold Dust can be refined to a Gold Nugget. This recipe can be prototyped with a Science Machine.

If Gold Dust is dropped on the ground near a Pangolden, the Pangolden will eat it. After consuming three Gold Dust, the Pangolden will produce a Gold Nugget. This is more efficient than refining Gold Dust into Gold Nuggets, as it requires three instead of six Gold Dust.

# Exclusivity: Don't Starve Together

![Lunacy Badge](Lunacy_Badge.gif)

> "They want to talk, but they don't know how!" - Webber

![Wilson at full Enlightenment](Enlightened_Wilson.png)

## Enlightenment (Lunacy)

Enlightenment, also referred to as Lunacy, is a game mechanic exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**.

Enlightenment replaces **Sanity** on the **Lunar Island**, in the **Lunar Grotto**, during nighttime when **Moonstorm** is active, in the Moonstorm itself and while standing close to a **Lunar Rift**, sharing the same value as Sanity. Effects that increase Sanity will increase Enlightenment on the Lunar Island or in the Lunar Grotto, and vice versa.

Enlightenment will also increase by 0.625/minute during the Day, and stops during Dusk and Night. Being in total Darkness will drain Enlightenment by -10/minute.

---

## Enlightenment Effects

![Screen effects at full Enlightenment](Enlightenment_Screen.png)

In essence, Enlightenment works as the reverse of Sanity, and both share the same values: a fully sane player who enters a Lunar area will gain a full Enlightenment gauge, which will cause effects similar to 0 Sanity within said area, and vice-versa. Therefore, the player cannot be completely sane in one world without being insane in the other.

High Enlightenment is accompanied with effects similar to low Sanity. The environment will begin to become distorted and creatures called **Gestalts** become visible in a similar manner to **Shadow Creatures**. Low Enlightenment produces results similar to high Sanity in which the Gestalts disappear and the environment returns to a normal state.

- Enlightenment ≥ 0%
  - Blue veil and ambient sounds appear slowly with Enlightenment.
- Enlightenment ≥ 17.5%
  - Pulsations in the center of the screen will begin to be visible.
- Enlightenment ≥ 25%
  - Gestalts appear, but they avoid the player.
- Enlightenment ≥ 50%
  - When inactive the player regularly shakes their head between their hands.
  - Gestalts no longer try to avoid the player and attack if the player is too close.
- Enlightenment ≥ 80%
  - Gestalts follow and attack the player if they are in range.
  - The audio cue for going insane plays.
- Enlightenment ≥ 85% for effects to appear and ≤ 82.5% to disappear
  - The enlightened character looks dizzy or awestruck when left idle.

---

## Trivia

- Enlightenment was introduced in the **Turn of Tides** update.
- Both Enlightenment and Lunacy are puns based on their effects: an "Enlightened" player would be succumbing to the effects of Lunar biomes (which are perpetually under the moon's light), while "Lunacy" has a double meaning, meaning either "insane" or "lunar" (anything related to the moon).
- The Enlightenment meter seems to be a reference to the moon cycle, with the eye at full Enlightenment representing **Alter**.

---

## Bugs

- Going on some pieces of temporary land like **Crab King**'s ice floe without getting on normal land in the process of getting there (like via a boat) you still get Enlightenment effects like you would still be on lunar island.

# Humid Season

### Exclusivity: Hamlet
### Stub

**Humid Season** is one of three **Seasons** in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, starting on day 12 and ending on day 22, lasting 10 days. It is indicated with the world having a bright blue tint. **Humid Season** **leads to** **Lush Season**, so players should prepare for coming **Hay Fever**. A few weather changes occur during this season, like intense **Rain** and **Heavy Fog**. During the **Heavy Fog**, the player may run slower if wearing a clothing item, and become wetter over time. It is probable that the BFB will spawn during this time.

## Seasonal Changes
- It is comparable to **Spring** in **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** and **Monsoon Season** in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**, as it rains a lot and **lightning** is common.
- **Heavy Fog** will surround the player often in this season.
- **Butterflies** no longer spawn from **Flowers** and ​**Evil Flowers**.
- **Glowflies** no longer spawn from **Exotic Flowers**.
- Glowflies turn into Glowfly Cocoons, and then become **Rabid Beetles**.
- **Great Leafy Stalks** have a chance to spawn Glowfly Cocoons around them.
While the fog is around, the player's character will announce that their current armor or hat is too hot or too heavy and will move at a reduced speed. Taking off the clothing will make the player move back at normal speed.

The **Pith Hat** and **Cowl** will negate the slowness that fog causes, allowing the use of the torso slot without being slowed. The **Weevole Mantle** will also cancel out the slowness that fog causes.

## Trivia
- In the **Hamlet** closed beta, Humid season didn't have its own work music and instead played the **Summer** theme from the base game, but it did have its own unique combat theme. As of now, it has its own work theme.

### Woodlegs

#### Character Info

- **Health**: 150
- **Hunger**: 150
- **Sanity**: 120
- **Sanity Multiplier**: 0 or -4.8/min
- **Items**: 
  - [Lucky Hat](Lucky Hat), [The 'Sea Legs'](The 'Sea Legs')
- **Start Items**: 
  - [Lucky Hat](Lucky Hat), [Spyglass](Spyglass), [Boat Cannon](Boat Cannon), 
  - [Boards](Boards) ×4, [Dubloons](Dubloons) ×4
- **Spawn Code**: "woodlegs"
- **Links**: 
  - [Woodlegs Quotes](Woodlegs quotes)
  - [Woodlegs Clothes](Woodlegs clothes)

Woodlegs spawns with 1/4th of the closest [X Marks the Spot] locations revealed on the [Map], a [Lucky Hat], [Spyglass], a [Boat Cannon], 4 [Boards] and 4 [Dubloons]. The last three let him create a special [Boats] only he can make - [The 'Sea Legs']. The 'Sea Legs' has the same durability and speed as an [Armoured Boat], and an infinite Boat Cannon that deals 50 damage.

![Woodlegs Sailing on The 'Sea Legs'](Woodlegs_Special.png)

His [Lucky Hat] lets Woodlegs 'sniff out' treasures. That means that as long as it is equipped, new [X Marks the Spot] treasures (maximum of 6 per hat) will spawn in the current or nearby islands. That makes the treasures renewable when playing as him. The Hat lasts 10 [Day]s and can be made in the [Nautical Tab] with 3 [Cloth], 4 [Bone Shards] and 10 [Dubloons]. Both the [Lucky Hat] and [The 'Sea Legs'] can be created from the start without any Research Stations.

#### Disadvantage

Woodlegs loses 4.8 sanity per minute when on land, and also when hugging the coast with a Boat. This coupled with the 120 maximum Sanity makes it very easy to go insane in the early days.

The 'Sea Legs' has no equippable slots and its acceleration is 50% slower. In addition to this, it has a stun immunity of only 1 second compared to the Armoured Boat's 2, but still higher than other Boats.

#### Tips for Prototype

1. In the early days, the easiest way to restore the Sanity lost from land exploration is to collect [Flowers] and [Seashells] while exploring.
2. It is possible to find a [Walking Cane] or [Thulecite Club] in [X Marks the Spot] [Chest]s early on, making the speed of The 'Sea Legs' more bearable without sails.
3. The [Coconade] fired from The 'Sea Legs' Cannon can be used to uncover [X Marks the Spot] Chests without the need of a [Shovel], as long as the treasure is inside the firing range of the Cannon.
   - Same thing applies to most objects that Tools can be used on, e.g. [Trees], [Boulders], [Bamboo Patch]es etc. Flammable objects will not be set on fire from the explosion that destroys them, nor will their drops, with the exception of Trees.
4. The 'Sea Legs' Cannon can be used to easily kill [Birds], [Crabbits], [Dogfish]es and [Jellyfish]es.
   - Since it does not aggro enemies hit with it, it is a very easy tool to effortlessly kill [Whale]s. Hitting a freshly killed Whale with it will result in them going in the second stage of bloating.
   - The Cannon can also be used instead of the [Machete] to harvest fully bloated Whales.
5. Whenever it lands on water, the Coconade of the Cannon will create [Waves] that will travel outward from the point of impact. Their direction is coded in a way that one will always target Woodleg's position on the time the Cannon was fired, so it is not advised to stay in one place while using the Cannon.
6. The perk of the [Lucky Hat] will still trigger when worn by a Prime Ape or Wildbore, albeit only 66% of the time. This can be exploited by giving multiple Hats to a lot of them and have a lot of [X Marks the Spot]s spawn at the same time.
7. Fighting the [Quacken] early on can be

# Sandstorms

Sandstorms are naturally occurring events exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. They happen during **Summer** in **Desert** **Biomes** containing the **Oasis** and the **Antlion**.

![Wilson in a Sandstorm without Desert Goggles](Wilson%20trapped%20in%20Sandstorm.png)

When entering a Desert during a Sandstorm, the player's Field of Vision will instantly become limited, disabling the ability to see anything except a small area around the character. Additionally, movement speed will be reduced by 60%. However, while riding **beefalo**, the movement speed will not get decreased. In order to avoid these effects, one must be equipped with **Desert Goggles**, **Astroggles** or the **Brightshade Helm**.

During rain, sandstorms will temporarily cease until after the ground is dry from the rain.

**Smoldering** objects will be extinguished while the sandstorm is active, preventing **wild fires** as well.

## Prototype Tips
- The Sandstorm makes the Oasis Desert a great place to base during Summer due to its wild fire prevention.
  - If the player is standing outside the Sandstorm, objects in the Oasis Desert can still start smoldering!
- The Sandstorm only occurs in the Oasis/Antlion Desert, so all other deserts in the world will remain unaffected.
- A **hound** wave in a sandstorm can be especially dangerous, so traveling into a sandstorm without Desert Goggles should only be done directly after one.
  - Due to the slowdown effect of the sandstorm, the player cannot kite hounds properly and will take damage attempting to do so. You cannot run from the hounds either as their fast speed will allow them to occasionally get a hit in, even when equipping a **Walking Cane**.

## Description

Mosaic biomes are typically restricted to one per map (though they also tend to be rather large).

## Prototype Tips

* Ghosts will come out of all graves on Full Moons, making a Graveyard a relatively dangerous place to be in.
* Wendy can safely base near or within a graveyard as ghosts will be passive, Pipspooks are plenty, and insanity auras emitted by the undead do not affect Wendy.

## Transformation

Wortox's backstory is revealed in the animated short [[Possessions]], the details of which are summarized in his biography from the [[Compendium]]:
> Wortox learned the hard way that one should always be mindful of the company they keep. Once a playful imp without a care in the world, Wortox spent his days helping a Krampus make mischief throughout the Constant. While the pair of rascals revelled in their roguery for a time, Wortox slowly began to see a darkness in the Krampus' heart, and the malice in his pranks. Not wishing for any real harm to come to anyone, the little imp finally put his cloven foot down, but in trying to stop his fiendish friend he unwittingly awakened a terrible power in himself...

Krampus and Wortox traipsed through the woods,
In the hopes to ruin goodness by being no good.

They both schemed with glee bearing grins of a fiend,
Oh you’re right, they’re quite wrong— they meant to be mean.

With their bounty of loot the haul was never enough,
Oh, what fun, to make glum by stealing one’s stuff.

But cruel-hearted fun still requires a heart,
And that’s where our two scoundrels drifted apart.

You see, mischief and malice is a line drawn quite thin,
And Wortox told Krampus: “This is where this one must end.”

Battling one’s nature is a most vicious affair,
But virtue gives vigor so that one might make a good tear!

And though Wortox felt better to have helped on the whole,
His fiendish half was still cursed to ensnare this foul soul.

So be careful what you wish for, a lesson worth mentioned,
For taking that which is not yours, can lead to possession.

## Trivia
- Wortox is described by Klei as "a fun, mischievous fellow with a big, kind heart— minus the fact that he eats souls for sustenance."
- Unlike the other survivors, Wortox wasn't trapped in the Constant. He arrived through the Ancient Gateway, according to his examination quote for the structure when deactivated. His place of origin is unknown.
- Wortox may know who the Ancient Statue depicts, judging by his quote. ("Hyuyu, did you lose a game?")
- Wortox has a mother, according to his quote for the Lavae Tooth. ("My mom still has mine somewhere.")
- Wortox's quotes reveal parts of his nature as an imp.
  - He might not have blood. (Held Mosquito - "I have no blood for you, sweet thing.")
  - The act of eating and preparing physical food is unpleasant and foreign. (Flower Salad - "I don't really like eating."/Froggle Bunwich - "Mortals are weird.")
  - He also can't digest food properly, and it might upset his stomach. (Pumpkin Cookies - "Real food is a bit hard on my stomach."/Spicy Chili - "I don't "digest" well."/ Hot Pumpkin - "Slightly easier on my impish tum.")
  - He is sensitive to the sound of the Lucky Whistle. ("Ooo, ouch! My ears!").
  - His curse manifests through his hands, and many of his lines suggest that he cannot touch others without risking the theft of their soul. (Failure to craft - "My hands are truly cursed."/Holding a Crow - "Careful, don't touch my hands.")
  - He dislikes Garlic and Salt, hissing at the items, and is glad when Salt Formations are destroyed. Despite this, he is able to consume both with no negative effects apart from the usual reduced stat gains.
