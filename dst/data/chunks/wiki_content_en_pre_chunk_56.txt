## Atrium
The **Atrium** is a **Biome** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It is similar to the **Labyrinth** biome but with some variances. Accessible only by descending a **Tentacle Pillar Hole** after defeating a Big Tentacle or using a **Lazy Explorer**, it is isolated from the rest of the **Ruins**. The **Ancient Gateway** is located at the end of the Atrium.

### Access and Obelisks
Players must pass through **Obelisks** that are closed unless the player's Sanity is less than 15%. They must be careful not to exceed 15% Sanity, or they will be trapped.

### Path and Features
The path to the Ancient Gateway is zig-zag, blocked by many **Ancient Fences**. The area is filled with **Dangling Depth Dwellers**, **Ancient Obelisks**, **Obelisks**, **Ancient Beacons**, **Atrium Statues**, and **Ornate Chests**, much like the Labyrinth. At the end of the Biome, there is a large area with the Ancient Gateway in the middle, surrounded by **Ancient Murals**, **Beacons**, **Pillars**, and **Atrium Statues**.

### Nightmare Cycle
Like the Ruins, the Atrium has the **Nightmare Cycle**. Inserting an **Ancient Key** in the Gateway locks the Cycle at its peak state, which will not change unless the key is removed.

### Ruins Reset
After defeating the **Ancient Fuelweaver**, the Gateway room shakes for 3 minutes before the **Ruins** reset.

## Tips
- **Lazy Explorer** and/or **Nightmare Amulet** are recommended for passing Obelisks, as manually managing Sanity can be risky with **Shadow Creatures**.
- Bring instant Sanity restore items like **Cooked Green Caps** or **Ice Cream** to avoid being stuck behind Obelisks.

## Trivia
- An atrium is a hall or court at a building's entrance or center, also referring to two chambers of the heart.

# Ancient Pseudoscience Station

## Overview

The Ancient Pseudoscience Station is a Crafting Structure found exclusively in the Ruins. It grants access to the Ancient Pseudoscience Filter and provides enough light to protect from Charlie when nearby.

## Details

- **Image Gallery**:
  - ![Full](AncientAltar.png)

- ... (and more quotes from other characters)

## Item Drops

| Chance (Each) | Result |
|---------------|--------|
| 12.3%        | Crawling Horror, Terrorbeak |
| 11.2%        | Gears, Trinkets ×4, Splumonkey ×2-4, Batilisk ×5, Cave Spider ×2, Spitter ×2 |
| 1.1%         | Dwarf Star |
| 0.56%        | Gemstones (Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Purple) |

| 0.056%       | Armors (Marble Suit, Night Armor, Snurtle Shell Armor) |

## Tips

- It is possible to farm items by continuously destroying and repairing the station, but enemies have a higher chance of spawning than loot.
- There will always be a naturally occurring fully operational Ancient Pseudoscience Station guarded by Damaged Bishops and Nightmare Lights.
- The Brightshade Smasher is more efficient for destroying the station, but if more loot is desired, use a Hammer instead.

# Set Pieces

Set pieces are rare, naturally spawned structures and items in all game modes. They were introduced in the "Doorway to Adventure" update. Players can usually find valuable items in the set piece. However, some set pieces function as a trap, forcing players to either bear the risk or disable the trap if possible. On some occasions, the player will have to retrieve the items from the set piece in order to escape the danger.

Players may also find skeletons lying around, oftentimes with items surrounding them. These are called **Failed Survivors**. Unlike other Set Pieces, they are never traps. A key way to tell the difference is that Failed Survivors lack structures, floors, walls, etc. Be aware that it is possible to find skeleton and set pieces combined. The spawn frequency of Failed Survivors can be adjusted in the World Customization screen.

**Note:** The names of most set pieces are unofficial; they are nicknames invented by the Don't Starve community.

## Spoil Food Trap

The Spoil Food trap is usually found in Swamp biome. The set piece contains some Rot's, a Skeleton, a Pig Head, and a Chest. If the player opens a Chest from the set piece, all food in the player's inventory will spoil. However, the player can avoid this by dropping all perishable items away from the trap and then opening the Chest, though this method may be problematic if there are Pigs or any other kind of Mobs nearby that might eat the dropped food.

Inside the Chest, there will be more Rots, and multiple Blueprints.

## Disused Beefalo Pen Trap

The disused Beefalo pen trap is usually located in a Savanna Biome and consists of a long Wood Wall fencing that curls around a squarish piece of land. Inside the fence are several Bones and Beefalo Wool, conveying the idea of an old Beefalo pen. There is a Chest at the entrance, which contains 1 Fire Staff, 4 Gunpowder, and 4 Logs.

Everything inside the fence can be taken. However, the Chest is trapped and will catch on fire when it's opened. The fire will cause the Gunpowder to explode, light the entire wooden fencing, and destroy the contents of the Chest. A way to prevent burning is to Hammer the nearby wood walls until they're destroyed. You can also extinguish the fire when the chest explodes. The fence can also manually be set on fire using Torch - providing a large amount of Ashes. This will not set the Chest on fire - but will also not disable its explosive trap. Hammering the Chest itself can trigger the trap.

All items can be taken from the Chest before the trap explodes, provided the player is fast enough. There is also a 34% chance for it to be a dud.

## Fire Staff Trap

This set piece consists of a Fire Staff surrounded by sleeping Red Hounds. Once the staff is retrieved, all Red Hounds will awake, causing the player to lose a large amount of sanity, and it will begin to rain.

The most efficient way to deal with this is to kill the Red Hounds before retrieving the staff, as each can be fought individually without fear of waking the others.

In Don't Starve Together, this set piece can also spawn in the Caves. This (and the one below) is the only way to have hounds legitimately in the Caves. This setpiece can be used with the Bee Queen Crown and pushing the sleeping Hounds close together to passively regenerate close to 200 sanity/minute.

## Ice Staff Trap

An Ice Staff trap, similar to the Fire Staff trap, is an Ice Staff surrounded by five sleeping Blue Hounds. Once the staff is retrieved, all five Blue Hounds will awake, causing the player to lose a large amount of sanity, and it will begin to rain.

The most efficient way to deal with this is to kill the Blue Hounds before retrieving the staff, as they can be fought individually without fear of waking the others.

In Don't Starve Together, this setpiece can also spawn in the Caves. This (and the one above) is the only way to have hounds legitimately in the Caves. This setpiece can be used with the Bee Queen Crown and pushing the sleeping Hounds close together to passively regenerate close to 200 sanity/minute.

## Spider Trap

There is a Spider Warrior sleeping on a Carpeted Flooring, close to a little Grass and Twigs farm. There are also Bones and a Pig Head around the Carpeted Flooring. If the Spider Warrior is attacked, three more Warriors will spawn around the player. Sometimes there are multiple sleeping Spider Warriors. In Don't Starve Together, some of the twigs are replaced by Twiggy trees.

One way to deal with the Spider Warrior without triggering the trap is to set down a Trap near it, then stand next to the spider until it awakens. When it does, it

- **Choose**: Wilson

### Description
Marotters are amphibious Mobs exclusive to Don't Starve Together. The marauding otters will spawn from Marotter Dens in groups of 2 and will wander around them in a radius of 7.5 tiles. Like other diurnal critters, Marotters will leave their dens in the morning and return during night, while sleeping in all day during Winter.

After spotting something they want to steal within a 5 tile radius of themselves, they will navigate to that item (maintaining chase and attacking a player or mob to make them drop the item if necessary), take it, and then retreat back to their den. This will add said item to the den's inventory. Marotters have herd instinct and thus will aggro onto anything that attacks another Marotter nearby.

Marotters will gladly smack open chests and fridges in order to knock an item out, proceeding to eat the item if it is meat or classified as "Horrible", and typically stealing it if it is not. Marotters will steal anything that is considered edible to any mob, following the Food Type system, meaning they will steal things like Rocks and Grass or Twigs too.

Searching the Marotter Dens while Marotters are out will not aggro them, but searching the dens during night or Winter will make Marotters come out and attack. Rowing the Marotter Den away will also trigger Marotters to attack the player.

### Tips
- The attack a Marotter does in order to knock an item out of a players inventory is fast enough for it to be extremely difficult to avoid even if you are walking away from them. However, if the player is anticipating this attack, they can cancel their stealing attack by simply hitting them before the animation has a chance to complete. This will, of course, aggro the target and the surrounding Marotters, so one must be prepared for a fight.

### Trivia
- The assets for Marotters were first seen within the files of the Don't Starve: Newhome Beta.
- The Marotters sounds were also found in the Don't Starve Together Hook, Line, & Inker update sounds file.
- In update 620060, Marotter's animations on surface were accidentally removed. Because of this, all Marotters in the game became invisible. This was quickly fixed in update 620148 [JesseB_Klei on the Forums]: "620148 has been set live for the invisible Otters."

# Don't Starve Together Survival Guide

## #1: Survive!
Although this may seem like an obvious tip, **survive!** More importantly, **survive by yourself!** Someone else's base may be far away from the Florid Postern, so you may not be able to get there on Day 1. Instead, prove your worth out in the wilderness and eventually stumble across the base, or just make your own!

## #2: You're not the Boss
Remember how you are in charge of every move you make? Well not any more, because this person probably knows more than you. When they tell you to leave the base and follow them, **leave**, because they are probably taking you to a better base.

## #3: Check the Season
This may seem like an obvious one, but **check the season of a server before you join**. Don't join in Winter or Summer, because the temperature will kill you before you have time to make a proper base.

## #4: Stay Close
To avoid constant death in a new server, **stay close to experienced members**. Unless they are going off to fight the Ancient Fuelweaver or something, they will most likely keep you close and protect you.

## #5: Offer Your Services
Playing Wendy? **Summon Abigail**. Playing Wickerbottom? **Read some books**. Playing Maxwell? **Summon some shadows**. Play as a character who hasn't joined the server yet, and offer your unique services to both bolster your chances of surviving and make everyone think you're a good person to keep around.

## #6: Practice Shadow Fighting
Shadows become hostile when your sanity gets below 15%, and they can be really dangerous. However, they can be really easy to kite one-on-one, so **practice doing so** to avoid being 'That guy who is always going insane and dying.'

## #7: Hit the Restart Button
If everything is going the wrong way, suggest to the server owner that you **rollback**. The server can be rolled back in the case of arsonists, anarchists, or griefers. If the owner refuses, remember there is always a huge number of servers online, so choose another one of them, or just host your own!

## #8: Summer Survival
Despite being a bad idea (it really is), Summer is still possible to survive through. During early/late summer, if you have a Whirly Fan, you can simply run in circles under trees to cool yourself down. It's possible to go through large areas of land if you find a tree every now and then. However, during the peak temperatures, you will need a **Straw Hat** to stop overheating, along with the Whirly Fan. You may need to just ask for help.

If you want to be the least of a nuisance as possible, gather some flint and gold to make a compass and ask which cardinal direction the base is from the spawn area.

The **Hippopotamoose** is a neutral **Mob** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It resides in or around the **Lily Pond** biome, entering and exiting the water at its leisure. It remains neutral toward the player until attacked.

If one Hippopotamoose is attacked, nearby Hippopotamoose will become hostile and approach the player. They have a close range bite attack, as well as a long-range jumping slam attack which can knock down **Tree**s and uproot **Tall Grass**, **Sapling**s, bushes and other plants, and destroy walls.

When moving through the water, they cause small **Waves** to appear, which can make the player **Wetness**wet and damage their **Boats**Boat.

Hippopotamoose roam in "pairs" and reproduce periodically (1.5-2 days) as long as at least one remains.

## Trivia
- Like the **Ancient Guardian**, the Hippopotamoose shares the same animation model as **Clockwork Rook**. Unlike them, the Hippopotamoose does not attack by charging.
- The Hippopotamoose is a combination between a hippopotamus and a moose.

# What is this about?
This guide will try to get you through some of the problems you'll face. Not all, some.

## Generating world
If you want to make your world most comfortable, don't set all resources to more, it will ruin the game. If you want to change something, change your settings to Land Branch->Most & Land Loop->Least. You will see, that your base should be in the middle, as the world appears to be an octopus, and you should make your base in the head.

Also be sure to add RoG if not playing SW and make your world SW compatible.

## Mods? Sure!
If you want, you can simplify the game by using some mods. I think those will do:

- PickyPickyPicky
- Always on status
- Item info
- Minimap HUD.

If you want, you may try to use more mods. If an error occurs, when you have plenty of mods active, try to guess, where's the problem (example: error cannot read a local inst 'inventory' → check mods like More slots, Pigs with hats, Digestion...). I wouldn't use more than 10 mods if not necessary.

## Surviving wild
I'm gonna tell you what to do for the first 20 days. I like to play as Wolfgang, but it's your choice! Try someone you haven't played yet/for a long time!

### Day 1
Gather as many resources as possible and try to explore a bit. Most characters should survive a day with no food, so make a torch. If you want, you can make a campfire and cook your food. Don't eat raw things. Raw meat lowers sanity and other raw things except corn restore more if cooked. Try to avoid going to rock, marsh and mixed biomes, as they don't contain much food and resources. If you found it, try to go in a dedicious biome->carrots, berries, birchnuts, twigs, grass, catcoons and very likely a pig king!

### Day 2-5
Continue gathering, try some caves for resources, make a science machine and prototype an alchemy engine but don't place it on the go. Use the Science machine to get a shovel, spear, log suit, and a backpack. Do not make a base yet. Just explore and **think** of a good place for a base.

### Day 6-10
Be ready for a hound attack around day 8. Also start to settle down, make a base, 2 farms, 5 saplings, 5 berry bushes, 5 grass tufts planted, start with crock pot meals, possibly an ice box. If you have found a glommers statue, head to it at day 9/10 (full moon). Try to kill a koalefant for meat. Don't make a vest from its trunk—it heats just as earmuffs do. Instead kill few beefalos and make a beefalo hat.

### Day 11-20
Now you should have a base, an explored chunk of map even in caves and should be ready for winter. It's time to farm a bit. In the morning plant all crops and go kill some pigmen or destroy that spider den! Find a Koalefant, kill a koalefant. Get a mandrake! You can even make a straw roll, and go exploring for two days! When you'll get back your crops should be fully grown! Relax! Make some meatballs, go to desert to take out dome Hounds and a Volt Goat, get a few Gears... Now it's your turn to do something creative! Give a pig some spoiled petals (awesome roses), a spoiled Garland (distinguished hat), and go on a date! Don't forget an ice cream!

## Threats
We both knew that there are some. You should avoid these if not ready. Here is a list of them.

### Marsh biome—Home of Tentacles, Merms & Spiders
You are just wandering around, it's day seven, you are quite brave and now you see a pink biome with cut reeds and think something like "Oh hey! I heard I can make paper with these!" You get to a reed, start collecting it and >BOOM< a Tentacle got off the ground and you have 30 Health. You are frightened, running away, and you don't notice a green fish-like thing hitting you YOU ARE DEAD! It's better not to go there in the first 10 days as Merms are fast, Spiders can stunlock you and Tentacles deal lots of damage.

The Playbills can be inserted into the lectern near the [Stage] to change the play. When examining the lectern, it tells the current scene and act along with the costumes required for it. The player can put on the required [Costumes] to perform on Stage.

Currently, there are two Playbills in the game.

## The Enchanted Doll

Quotes:

- **Walter**: It's like a radio play you can watch!
- **Wanda**: What an odd little play.
- **Warly**: I wonder who will play the lead?
- **Wigfrid**: I am nöt familiar with the playwright.
- **Maxwell**: I think she's enjoying this a bit too much.
- **Webber**: What a funny play!
- **Wendy**: What a strange little story.
- **Wickerbottom**: I suspect there's a deeper meaning to its storyline.
- **Willow**: What a weird story.
- **Wilson**: "Authored by C.W."
- **Winona**: Somehow I think there's more to the story.
- **Wolfgang**: Is very hard to remember so many words.
- **Woodie**: The theater ain't really my sorta thing.
- **Wormwood**: Sad story
- **Wortox**: A curious tale of friendship and betrayal.
- **Wurt**: Too many words to remember, florp.
- **WX78**: RUNSCRIPT "THE ENCHANTED DOLL"
- **Choose**: wigfrid

**The Enchanted Doll** is usually found inside the lectern when generating the world. Sometimes a copy may appear next to Playbill if there is more than one player on the server.

The play focuses on the life of a Doll and her travels throughout the land, as she meets various characters: a caring Blacksmith, a powerful King, a mysterious Mirror, and a Fool. An actor may also play the role of a Tree, although the tree contributes nothing to the story line and is purely decorative. The play seems to be biased in favor of the Doll – additionally, both [[Maxwell]] and [[Winona]] have unique quotes should they be watching the play and not performing.

Required Costumes:

### About

Once upon a time, a porcelain Doll magically comes to life. The Doll is overwhelmed with joy and wishes to travel the world, but the Blacksmith who created her is afraid for her safety and fashions a suit of armor for her to wear. The heavy armor cracks the Doll from the strain, so later that night, she removes the armor and runs away from the Blacksmith.

The Doll eventually travels into a large city, where she witnesses a King using magic to make plantlife sprout around him. The two bonded and went on many wonderful adventures together, but the King would never honor his promise to teach the Doll his magic, using various excuses every time she asked. The Doll eventually discovers that the King had held a mysterious Mirror hostage inside a hidden chamber of his castle, and siphoned its power for his own selfish gain. The King discovers the two conversing, and strikes the Doll down with a blast of magic.

The Mirror is able to save the Doll's life, but she is left disfigured and incomplete; The King has broken the Mirror and stolen a large portion of his power, rendering it unable to make her whole. The Doll tried and failed to track the King down, who secluded himself in a distant area, but eventually discovered that he has been sending Fools to entertain him. The

## Behavior
- A Blue Whale is a neutral Ocean animal that spawns after the player has tracked it down by examining Suspicious Bubbles. Blue Whales can't swim into the Shallow Ocean and will turn away from its borders if approaching it. They are considered innocent creatures, and killing one adds 7 points to the player's naughtiness level, which can cause Krampus to appear. Blue Whales cannot be set on fire.

When approached, the Blue Whale will swim away from the player, although it is slow and the player can easily catch up. When the player gets close enough to the Blue Whale it will stop and poke its head out of the water. The Blue Whale creates two large waves when it attacks, though the player can be safe at attacking distance given the spread.

After it has been angered, the Blue Whale will attempt to close the distance between it and the attacker. A player can safely kite one with an attack pattern of 5-6 swings, depending on movement speed. However, if there is more than one Blue Whale on-screen then all of them will become aggressive towards the attacker until they are killed or outrun.

## Hunting
- By investigating Suspicious Bubbles, one can find a Blue Whale. These can be found randomly in the deep ocean biome. Functioning identically to the Koalefant's Suspicious Dirt Pile, these bubbles will change locations if ignored for a period of time. Once investigating Suspicious Bubbles three will pop in the same direction, if followed it will lead to another Suspicious Bubbles or the Blue Whale approximately two screens away. Upon uncovering the final bubble (there can be between 6 and 12 per hunt), the character will alert the player that the creature is close and a Blue Whale will be spawned rather than another bubble. Note that there is a chance of up to 33% that a White Whale will spawn instead, based on the number of days survived.

Slain Blue Whales don't immediately drop items, instead becoming a Blue Whale Carcass when killed. The carcass will go through 3 stages: Bloated stage 1 (recently killed, withered, and rotting), bloated stage 2 (larger, emits more smell), and bloating stage 3 (severely deformed, shaking softly). During stages 2 and 3, the Blue Whale Carcass will create a squeaking sound that can be heard from about 8 boat lengths away. The Blue Whale Carcass will take 3-5 days to fully bloat (only if it has been loaded once during that play session). When bloated, it can be popped with a Machete and it will explode, dropping 4 Raw Fish, 4 Blubber, and 9 other random items.

There is a tricky problem post-hunting: picking up all the items dropped may turn out to be difficult. The dropped Raw Fish are highly possible to trigger Sea Hound/Crocodog spawning. Player may be overwhelmed by a large amount of these monsters, and cannot pick up the raw fish and blubber before the monsters eating all of them, making all the effort paid on hunting in vain.

# Winter Survival Guide for New Players

## Introduction
For new players, the prospect of Winter can be daunting. The game gets difficult, with all sorts of new dangers, and food and new resources become much scarcer than in Summer (Autumn in RoG). This guide is based around my own personal experience. It also assumes that you are playing with RoG, but most of the information can be applied to vanilla DS as well.

## Major Changes in Winter

### Temperature Drops
The biggest change in Winter is that the temperature drops greatly. Players with no insulation will start to freeze quickly. It's important to always have the means to build a Campfire during winter.

### Frozen Ponds and Animal Changes
Another change in Winter is that Ponds freeze over, meaning that you can no longer fish and Frogs stop spawning. Rabbits also turn white, and Redbirds are replaced by Snowbirds.

### Winter Onset
Winter starts at Day 21 by default, and you can see that it's winter when Snowbirds start landing and the air gets a blue tint. Game sounds will also sound slightly muffled and you will hear cold winds blowing.

### Ice Hounds and Deerclops
Another change in Winter is that you will get Ice Hounds in your hound attacks. These will freeze nearby players and creatures (including nearby Hounds), so be careful. Deerclops will spawn, and Walrus igloos will open, allowing the McTusk hunting party to come out.

## Equipment

### Stockpiling Resources
Before winter starts, you'll want to start stockpiling. Start gathering wood, cut grass, reeds, rocks, twigs, anything you'll need over the winter. Things like Saplings and Grass don't grow back in the winter.

### Stockpiling Food
You'll also want to start stockpiling food. Berry Bushes stop growing, and Farms will stop working. If you try to fertilize a crop with Rot or Manure, your character will say 'I can't do that,' so stockpile vegetables and fillers beforehand. An Ice Box is key, although food rots more slowly during the winter.

### Staying Warm
In order to keep warm, there are clothes you'll need to get. A Winter Hat can be made of Beefalo Wool and Silk and will keep you warm for a while. In addition, Wilson and Webber's Beards will keep them warm depending on their lengths. You can kill a Koelephant and use its Trunk to make a Breezy Vest, however it's more efficient to wait until Winter starts to hunt a Koelefant, because a Puffy Vest will keep you warm for longer.

### Thermal Stones
Finally, a Thermal Stone is key. You may want to make more Stones if you're playing DST, as Thermal Stones have durability, unless you're playing with the No Thermal Stone Durability mod. These can be made with Rocks, Flint and a Flint Pickaxe.

## First Few Days

### Managing Resources
The first few days of winter aren't so bad. You're unlikely to freeze, Ponds and Farms will still function for a while, and you're probably doing fine for Hunger. Make sure not to stray too far from your base, and if you think you're up to it, try hunting down the Winter Koelefant before winter gets more severe.

### Hunting Strategies
In my experience, Winter Rabbits are a little harder to kill with a weapon than Summer ones are. Try placing traps directly over Rabbit holes, so when the rabbits emerge, they'll fall right into the traps. Killing Beefalo and Pigs if you know how to kite them can be worth it as well, although if you're hunting beefalo, be sure not to kill them all, because they are a renewable source of Meat and Beefalo Wool if you know what you're doing.

### Avoiding McTusks
Watch out for the McTusks. They will taunt you and eventually attack you. They'll drop Walrus Tusks when killed, which can be used to make a walking cane.

### Gathering Wood
Keep on gathering resources like Wood. Keep a tree farm close to your base, if you haven't already (or if there's a Treeguard near your base. In this case, use Birchnut trees; Evergreen Treeguards won't aggro you if you chop Birchnut trees.)

## After A While...

### Deerclops
Deerclops doesn't spawn every Winter, but when he does, be prepared. Deerclops usually spawns around 10ish days into Winter. When he's about to spawn, you'll hear a low growling sound. When you hear this, you might want to run away from your base. Deerclops exists simply to destroy any structure he can find.

# Exclusivity: Shipwrecked

## Biome Infobox
- **Abundant**: Coffee Plant, Magma Pile, Gold Magma Pile, Obsidian Boulder, Charcoal Boulder
- **Occasional**: Skeleton, Elephant Cactus, Krissure, Dragoon Den
- **Rare**: Volcano Altar, Obsidian Workbench, Woodlegs (only once)
- **Image**: Volcano Icon.png

## Quote
> "Me ol' prison." - Woodlegs

The **Volcano** is a **Biome** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, much like Caves in the regular **Don't Starve** world. The biome can be accessed through the **Volcano (object)** which is found in the **Ocean**.

### Characteristics
The Volcano is a small area surrounding the mouth of the Volcano, and is affected by weather. At the center, the mouth of the volcano contains a large pool of lava, and approaching it will quickly increase the temperature of the player character to the maximum and cause damage from **Overheating**. During Dry Season, eruptions will cause the entire Volcano area to rise in temperature as well, causing immediate Overheating effect similar to getting close to the central lava. This effect will last for a period of time after the eruption ends.

The area is mostly covered with a mixture of **Volcano Turf**, **Magma Turf**, and **Ashy Turf**, and the **Magma Pile**s are abundant. **Skeleton**s and **Krissure**s are also commonly encountered.

**Coffee Plant**s and **Elephant Cactus**|Elephant Cacti are found here. These can be dug up with a **Shovel** and replanted elsewhere, but they can only be planted on volcanic turfs. Burnt **Ash Tree**s can also be found here. Chopping these trees will yield **Ashes**. **Dragoon Den**s, and their **Dragoon**s are native to the Volcano Biome. Obsidian and Charcoal **Boulder**s can also be found here.

The area contains one **Obsidian Workbench** that allows the crafting items in the **Volcanic Tab**. **Volcano Altar of Snackrifice** is also in the area, and provides limited control over eruptions by sacrificing items in the **Dry Season**.

### Woodlegs
If **Woodlegs** is not unlocked, Woodlegs' Cage will be found here. The cage can be unlocked by finding and using all 3 keys: the **Iron Key**, the **Golden Key**, and the **Bone Key**.

Unlocking the cage will additionally drop some **Bone Shards**. Even if unlocked, the special turf under his cage and a couple of Bone Shards will continue to spawn in newly generated worlds.

### Mechanics
- **Flowers**, if **Butterfly|Butterflies** are manually planted, do not spawn Butterflies inside the Volcano.
- **Bee**s will pollinate flowers as usual so **Bee Box**es can be brought up to farm **Honey**.
- **Flooding|Puddles** do not spawn when it rains inside the Volcano during **Seasons/Monsoon|Monsoon Season**, regardless of the type of **Turfs|Turf**.
- **Crocodog**s do not spawn, and neither do **Hound**s or **Depths Worm**s. As a result, there are no pack attacks. Due to this, this may be a good base if one has overheating reduction items.
- The **Day-Night Cycle** functions as it does outside, as does the **Moon Cycle**.
- All effects of **Seasons/Hurricane|Hurricane Season** will function regularly, except for the spawning of **Sealnado**.
- **Birds** do not spawn inside the Volcano, regardless of the type of turf.

### Trivia
- If the player manages to cross into the pool of lava (using console commands or **The Lazy Explorer**), they will instantly die, and the cause of **Death** in the morgue will be listed as "Burnt". If they resurrect afterwards with a **Touch Stone** or similar, they will not be able to retrieve any inventory items other than character-specific gear. Other indestructible items such as the **Fishbone** or **Things** will be stuck on top of the lava. Dying this way may or may not leave a skeleton.
- The Volcano does not allow Crocodog waves, making it a valid place for a base.
- Dry Season does not seem to affect the plants inside the Volcano

- **Rare**:

### Quote
"I wonder why she's so determined to stay here." - Warly examining a Plugged Fissure.

### Description
The **Hermit Island** is a unique area exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. It is a remote island located far out into the **Ocean** and accessible only by **Boat** or using **Woody's Weregoose form** or soul hopping as Wortox. It is covered with **Moon Crater Turf** and **Shell Beach Turf**.

The **Crabby Hermit** lives on this island with her **Hermit Home**, a **Bee Box** and 6 **Drying Racks**.

Its vegetation is similar to the **Lunar Island's**, with **Lune Trees**, **Lunar Saplings**, **Moon Glasses**, **Driftwoods** and **Bull Kelps**. **Plugged Fissures** are found in place of **Celestial Fissures**, and **Enlightenment** does not take place on the Hermit Island.

In addition, **Shell Bells** are found on the ground and 9 **Shell Clusters** are present as **Underwater Salvageables** around the Island.

### Trivia

## Rot Usage

Rot is produced when food items (excluding Eggs) spoil. Additionally, Mushroom Planters will drop Rot when harvested in Winter.

- **Fertilizer**: Rot can be used as Fertilizer for Farming (e.g., Farm Soil, Grass Tufts, and Berry Bushes) or as a source of Fuel. It is as effective as Manure in fertilizing transplanted Grass Tuft and Berry Bush; otherwise, it is inferior to Manure in all other cases as fertilizer or fuel.

- **Crafting**: Rot is required to craft Booster Shots, Marsh Turfs, Composting Bins, and Mushroom Planters. It can also be attached to a Sea Fishing Rod as a single-use lure.

- **Mobs**: Some Mobs, such as Pigs or Smallish Tallbirds, will eat Rot left on the ground, but they cannot be given Rot directly. Since Rot doesn't restore any Health or Hunger to Mobs, they are able to consume an infinite amount of Rot left on the ground.

- **Set Pieces**: Rot may appear along with other items (such as Rope and Bird Traps) in a Set Piece, near a Chest and/or Backpack. Opening either container will cause the player's perishable items to turn to Rot, though this can be avoided by dropping the items a distance away first.

- **Rain**: When left on the ground, Rot may dissolve in the Rain.

> "It smells like a barn." - Maxwell

The Savanna biome is rich with Grass and Mobs, while containing little flora. It is the only Biome where Beefalo spawn, but is also home to many Rabbits, Redbirds, and Crows. Spider Dens may also rarely appear. Flowers are sometimes found, which spawn Butterflies.

## Sections

### Beefalow Plain
- Section with Savanna Turf.
- Objects occupy 5%, with 33.33% Grass and 66.67% Beefalo.

### Plain
- Section with Savanna Turf.
- Boulders, Grass, Rabbit Holes, and Green Mushrooms.
- Sometimes Sinkhole, Eye Bone, and Celestial Sanctum Icon.

### Clearing
- Section with Grass Turf.
- Pig Houses, Fireflies, Grasses, Saplings, Twiggy Trees, Twigs, Berry Bushes, Juicy Berry Bushes, Beehives, Red Mushrooms, Green Mushrooms, and Evergreens.
- Sometimes Sinkhole, Eye Bone, and Junk Yard.
- 1.5% chance for a mushroom ring to spawn in the section.

## Tips
- Savanna is usually a very good Biome to settle in due to the abundance of Grass and renewable food sources. Other essential renewable resources such as Twigs and Evergreens can be easily transplanted from other Biomes, as long as it is big enough to settle a camp in.

## Trivia
- In older versions of the game, the Savanna Biome had a more reddish hue on the map.

# Crock Pot Dishes Guide

This guide lists all the Crock Pot dishes in the game, organized by their effectiveness.

## Calculation

### Bonus Points
A crock pot dish must give more than the ingredients sacrificed to make it and ideally be better than other dishes in some way.

### Efficiency
Efficiency matters in times of extreme scarcity and is a measurement of the number of bonus points you're getting for each instance of a given ingredient.

### Inedible ingredients
Red caps, monster meat, and spoiled food have penalties that arguably make them inedible, while twigs simply cannot be consumed.

## Tips

- Check the [[Crock Pot]] page for a complete list of recipes.
- High point vegetables, such as [[Corn]], [[Pumpkin]] or [[Eggplant]], should usually be eaten raw or cooked over a fire.
- Don't put more than 1 monster meat in a recipe, unless it contains at least 1 twig (excluding Kabobs).

### Description
The **Battlegrounds** is a biome in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. This biome is characterized by burnt trees with charcoal scattered on the ground. The scorch marks resemble the spawn location of Dragonfly and the impact marks left by Meteor Showers in Don't Starve Together. Iron Hulks reside in this biome alongside a relative abundance of flowers. The Battlegrounds has no specific Turf and is instead partly barren and partly covered in Rainforest Turf.

# How to Not Starve in Don't Starve: Reign of Giants (RoG)

This guide is about how to not starve in **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** (RoG). This guide will have RoG things included, but some of the ways to survive might be able to be converted/used in normal Don't Starve.

## The Characters of Don't Starve

There are eleven total characters in **Reign of Giants**. This is a list of advantages and disadvantages for them.

Additional information for Maxwell and Wes is especially welcome, though any characters could use some more details I'm sure.

### Wilson

[Wilson] is the first character and is always unlocked. He can be a quite useful starter character and still can be useful for an experienced player.

One of his perks is that he grows a beard. This is useful for a couple reasons. There are three stages of beard growth: In four days, you can grow a short beard. In 7 days, you have a long beard. In 15, you have a magnificent beard.

His beard is especially helpful during [Winter], and will provide insulation for a period of time. A short beard keeps him warm for 15 seconds, a long beard gives you 45 extra seconds, and a magnificent beard is 135 seconds. Note that a beard will cause you to overheat faster in the [Summer], and as such should be shaved in the [Spring].

When you shave it with a [Razor], it yields [Beard Hair] and restores some sanity. A short beard gives you 1 beard hair, a long beard gives you 3, and a magnificent beard gives you 9. This is particularly useful, as Beard Hair can be used to craft a [Meat Effigy], which is a renewable way of resurrection. For other characters, collecting Beard Hair is more difficult, as it requires either killing [Beardling]s or [Beardlord]s (which only appear at low sanity) or obtaining it randomly from a [Tumbleweed].

Wilson's stats are considered average, and are not particularly slated in favor of or against a certain stat.

- Health: 150
- Hunger: 150
- Sanity: 200

### Willow

[Willow] is a very average character. Her infinite lighter is quite useful for Free [Charcoal] when needed. However, she has her disadvantages.

Her starting item is her [Willow's Lighter|lighter]. It can be used as a light source when turned on and it can start fires. It cannot cook items, which makes sense. In the night it can be used like a [Torch], but you automatically have it, it takes no resources and it has no durability so it can be used as much as you want it to be used. If you can't find the materials to make a torch or campfire you can use the lighter to avoid [Charlie].

Her main perk is that she's good with [fire]. She does not take damage from burning stuff, which is very useful when dealing with [Hound] or other hostile creatures. You can light a forest on fire and run through it, while the monsters in pursuit are injured by the fire. This could be a useful tactic when fighting the [Deerclops].

She also gains [Sanity] standing near a fire, which is useful because she has low sanity. Standing close enough to a [Campfire] during the night negates the sanity loss.

One of her disadvantages is that when she has 60 or less sanity, she may start fires at her feet. She will say "Tee hee", "I made a fire" or "Oops." They are small fires, but near flammable objects it does spread. You must be careful with that, though it can be useful when running from the pursuit of hostile monsters.

- Health: 150
- Hunger: 150
- Sanity: 120

### Wolfgang

[Wolfgang] is a somewhat weak character when beginning the game. However, if used correctly, he can turn into a killing machine.

He has three stages: Wimpy. normal and mighty.

When he has 100 or less hunger, he will be in wimpy form. He will look sad and pathetic because of lack of food. His max health is 150. His damage will change to be between 0.75x and 0.5x depending on hunger. His speed will decrease to 90%. His hunger will go down between 1.5X and 1X the normal rate.

When he has 100-225 hunger, he will be in normal form. He will look normal. His max health is 200. His damage will be ordinary,and the same is with speed. His hunger goes down 1.5x faster than normal.

When Wolfgang's hunger is above 225

# The Rocky Plains
The **Rocky Plains** is an environment that can be found inside the **Caves**. These areas serve as a habitat for **Rock Lobsters**. Just like **Stalagmite Terrain**, the entire area is covered by two types of **turfs**, namely **Cave Rock Turf** and **Guano Turf**. There are no known **plants** that can be found in this **biome**. Additionally, the player can rarely find Nightmare Fissures.

# Seafood Gumbo

## Description
**Seafood Gumbo** is a **Crock Pot** recipe. It requires more than 2.0 units of **Fish**. In DST, using at least 1 **Eel** is mandatory, otherwise the resulting meal will be **Surf 'n' Turf** which requires 2.5 Meat value. Currently, Eel is the only Fish with more Fish value than Meat value (1.0 Fish value and 0.5 Meat).

Adding **Ice** will yield **Ceviche** instead, unless a **Wobster** is also added, which will yield **Lobster Bisque**. Adding **Meats** value 2.5 or higher will yield **Surf 'n' Turf** instead. Adding a Wobster and **Butter** will yield **Lobster Dinner** instead. Adding exactly 2 **Kelp Fronds** will yield **California Roll** instead. Adding **Barnacles** will yield **Stuffed Fish Heads** instead. Adding Meats value 1.25 or higher and **Tallbird Egg** or Fried Tallbird Egg may yield **Bacon and Eggs** instead. Adding more than one **Monster Food**s may yield **Monster Lasagna** instead. Adding **Corn**, single **Twig** or **Mandrake** may respectively yield **Fish Tacos**, **Fishsticks** or **Mandrake Soup** instead.

It restores 40 Health, 37.5 Hunger and 20 Sanity. The Health and Hunger restoration is comparable to **Fishsticks**, though the Sanity restoration is much higher.

# Don't Starve Survival and Resource Gathering Guide

Hello, fellow starvers. This guide will show you how not to die in Don't Starve and get resources very fast without using any glitches or bugs. Let's start from day 1.

## First Day
You just spawned with whatever character you have and want to get resources as fast as possible. Here's how:

- Run around as fast as possible, collect every **twig**, **grass**, and **flint** you can.
- Collect only 5-15 food items to avoid wasting it too quickly.
- When dusk comes, start chopping trees (once you've made an **axe**; if not, make it now).
- Keep around 20 **logs** at this time, and you can repeat this process daily to replenish your wood.
- I recommend keeping around 30-40 logs for a later step.
- If you have enough grass and twigs and rabbit holes nearby, set some traps for extra food or rabbit earmuffs.
- If you find a rock biome and have time before the night, feeling lucky, you could skip straight to day 2.

## Day 2
You have some resources and wonder what to do next:

- Quickly look around the map for a **rock biome**.
- If you find one, jackpot! If not, keep looking for the next days while collecting food if it reaches around 2-4 pieces.
- Once you've found it, get your **pickaxe** and start mining all rocks (especially gold ones).
- Aim for 35-40 rocks minimum and 8-10 gold, but you can keep doing it the whole day if you choose.

## Resource Utilization
By now, you should have a respectable amount of resources:

- Go to any **rabbit holes** you found, craft some **traps**, and put them over most of them (remember to keep 10-20 twigs and grass).
- Make a torch, burn 10-30 **trees**, and harvest more grass (if you kept more than 10-20, minimum around 30-40, skip this).
- You should get around 20-30 coal, but any amount from 10 to 20 is good too.
- If you found your ideal base location, make your fire pit there. If not, keep looking.
- Make your fire pit, science machine to prototype the **alchemy engine**, electrical doodads, **boards** (extra logs could help if you kept them, if not, just go and get some more).
- Make the alchemy engine, and you're set.
- Use the twigs and coal from burnt trees to make some **drying racks** and **crock pots** (in the food tab).
- Make around 5-10 of them (2-5 work too, but 5-10 would stock you better for winter and other seasons if on RoG).

## Crafting and Exploration
Now you should craft some **armor** and **weapons**. I recommend a **spear** and **log suit** at minimum.

- Keep them in your inventory and explore your world for chess biomes.
- When you find one, use the following strategies according to the enemy (remember you need to kill only one as a bare minimum):

  - **Clockwork Knight**: Almost impossible to kite, but if you can, do it. If not, you should just full-out tank him and then heal yourself.
  - **Clockwork Rook**: This guy's a bit more rough, but still manageable. Dodge his charge, go to him if he still didn't finish his countdown, hit him a few times, and repeat. If he is about to charge again, repeat until you can hit him without him being able to charge.
  - **Clockwork Bishop**: Always try to tank him. His ranged attacks aren't hard to dodge from a far distance, but at close distance, they are a pain, so you should always tank him, but you can also try to kite the ranged attacks if feeling lucky.

## Base Management
- Got the gears? Good, now get back to the base.
- Get any spare wood you have and refine it into boards (4 logs if you don't have any, chop a minimum of 4) or rocks, depends if on RoG or not (on RoG is the same recipe, only with cut stone, which takes 4 rocks), the gears, and 2 gold nuggets, and make the ice box.
- Get some more wood you have (get more if you don't have 12 wood minimum), and craft a chest.

## Maintenance
- Keep yourself restocked with at least 20-30 twigs and flint, 10-15 rocks, and 10-20 pieces of food at all times.
- Leave any things you don't need for now into

# Wee MacTusk

## Overview
![Wee MacTusk Image](File:WeeTusk.png){width=100px}
Wee MacTusk (also known as WeeTusk) is an aggressive Mob that spawns from Walrus Camps during Winter. He controls the Blue Hounds.

## Stats
- **Diet**: Meat
- **Health**: 100
- **Spawns From**: Walrus Camp
- **Walk Speed**: 3
- **Run Speed**: 5
- **Spawn Code**: "little_walrus"

- **Wagstaff**: "Appears to be an adolescent form of the larger specimen."
- **Wickerbottom**: "The juvenile is not as aggressive."
- **Webber**: "He has anger in his eyes."
- **Warly**: "Oh, there's a little one!"
- **WX-78**: "PATHETIC"

- **Wurt**: "Hello, florp! Wanna play?"
- **Walter**: "I've never seen a real walrus up close!"
- **Wanda**: "Ah, youth. Enjoy it while you can."
- **Choose**: "Maxwell"

## Hunting
| Weapon | No. of hits for WeeTusk |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Fishing Rod, Bug Net | 8 |
| Lucy the Axe | 6 |
| Shovel, Pitchfork | 4 |
| Hammer, Torch, Umbrella, Walking Cane, Willow's Lighter | 3 |
| Axe, Pickaxe | 2-4 |
| Luxury Axe, Opulent Pickaxe, Boomerang, PickSlashAxe | 2 or 3 |
| Spear, Bat Bat | 2 |
| Ham Bat, Morning Star | 1 |

## Behavior
Wee MacTusk and his group are only active during daytime and will return to their igloo at dusk unless provoked by attacking the sleeping Hounds. They are hostile towards almost any Mob and follow a nearby target until they give up or are attacked. If MacTusk and Wee MacTusk die, the Hounds will attack freely until they respawn. Dead members respawn in 2.5 days.

## Tips
It's prudent to set up defenses, such as Tooth Traps, when encountering a dormant Walrus Camp.

## Trivia
- MacTusk N' Son was introduced in the "A Winter's Tale" update.
- Both walruses share the same hunchback model as Pigs, Merms, and Bunnymen.
- In the trailer for "A Winter's Tale", Wee MacTusk also attacks the player.

## Bugs
- MacTusk will become passive and return to his camp if chased outside of his wandering range, ignoring enemies.
- In "Don't Starve", WeeTusk won't drop Meat when killed because the wrong set of brackets is used in his loot table.
- If the Walrus Camp is close to the shore, MacTusk may respawn and walk on the ocean, unable to get back on land. This bug also occurs to other mobs (such as Pigs and Wildbore) if their housing structure is too close to the ocean.
- When the season changes, the group may be locked out of their camp, and therefore, be active outside of Winter.

- **WX-78**: YOU HAVE AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF NOSE

- **Wilba**: A NOSE BY OTHER NAME 'TIS CALL'DED A BEAK
- **Wormwood**: Big Nose Tweeter
- **Wheeler**: If you can fly with that big beak, maybe you can handle flying a person.
- **Choose**: WX-78

In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, Toucans replace Crows, dropping the same type of feather. Toucans will spawn and land on most Turfs, similar to Crows. They fly down from off-screen and peck the ground for a few moments, then fly away. When they take flight, there is a chance that Seeds are left behind. Birds will also be attracted to Seeds left on the ground. If the player or most other mobs get too close, birds will be frightened away. Birds won't land on Sticky Webbing and will swiftly fly away if they already land.

When killed, birds drop a Morsel or a Feather, and all other birds nearby will fly away. They are considered innocent creatures, and killing them directly adds points to the player's naughtiness level, which causes Krampus to appear. Killing a Crow adds 1 point to the player's naughtiness level, while killing a Redbird or Snowbird adds 2 points.

Birds inside the player's inventory will starve in 2 days unless they are fed Seeds.

In Shipwrecked, Birds take 100 poison damage per interval instead of normal 2. Birds won't land on flooding tiles, and will swiftly fly away if they already land and the flooding spreads.

## Hunting
Birds can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one. They can be Murdered by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel. Birds in the player's inventory can be dropped on the ground and will flop on the ground belly-up for a short while before flying off. They can also be imprisoned in Bird Cages.

Hunting Birds requires a ranged weapon such as a Boomerang. Birds will not land within melee range (even if bait is placed on the ground) and will fly away when the player approaches. However, if they are put to sleep when using characters with a normal damage modifier, they can be killed in 1 hit with a sufficient melee weapon.

If a bird is in flight while in range of a sleeping item's effect, it will plummet to the ground and can be picked up as an item.

Wearing a Feather Hat will increase the number of Birds spawning as well as decreasing the time between spawns. Using Birds of the World (while playing as Wickerbottom) will also cause a large number of them to land.

One can send a Smallbird to attack a Bird. This can be done without the bird getting frightened and without raising naughtiness.

They take one blast from the Ice Staff to be frozen and one Sleep Dart to be put to sleep.

## Webber Revival
![Webber reviving.](File:Webber%20Revival.png)

**Webber's Skull** is an item used to unlock the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** character, **Webber**. It has a 5% chance to drop when any **Spider** dies, including variants in **Caves** and **Ruins**. It can also be dropped when any tier **Spider Den** or **Spilagmite** is destroyed or a **Spider Queen** is killed with the same chance. The skull will not drop if it already exists in the world or if Webber is already unlocked. Trapped Spiders will not drop the skull.

Burying Webber's Skull in a dug-up **Grave** will cause Webber to appear under a "spotlight" after the grave is struck by **Lightning**. He will then jump back down into the grave, disappearing, while 6 Spiders appear in his place. Webber is then unlocked in the character menu. The Spiders will be aggressive towards the player, though killing them is not necessary for unlocking Webber.

Webber's Skull will keep dropping as long as it hasn't been buried, but not more than one in each world unless the previous one is destroyed.

After being buried, the grave will be struck immediately.

## Prototype Tips
* Increasing the amount of Spiders and **Pigs** in **World Customization** can help with finding the Skull, since Spiders fighting with Pigs will be more commonplace, and each Spider killed by Pigs has a chance to drop the Skull as well. However, players would have to pay attention to all the battles around, since the skull isn't going to drop more than once per world.

## Trivia
* The addition of Webber's Skull makes Webber one of six playable characters that is not unlocked via experience, the other five being **Wes**, **Maxwell**, **Woodlegs**, **Wilbur**, and **Wilba**.
* Webber's Skull will become "Ashes of Webber's Skull" (**Ashes**) when carried through the **Teleportato**.
* Many other characters have skulls found in the game files but they are unused.
* While the skull does not drop in **Don't Starve Together**, all

## Description

Beeswax is a **Refine**d **item**. It requires 1 **Honeycomb** to craft, and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. It can be used to craft **Wax Paper**, which can then be used in other recipes. If left on the ground near certain heat sources, the Beeswax will melt and vanish, and cannot be retrieved. This can easily be avoided by placing it inside a **Chest** or **Backpack**.

Beeswax is a renewable item as honeycombs are renewable from the **Gigantic Beehive**. It can be used to preserve **Giant Vegetables** as decorative items.

The Pick/Axe is a craftable Item found in the Ancient Pseudoscience Filter. It requires 1 Luxury Axe, 1 Opulent Pickaxe, and 2 Thulecite, and an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. It also has a 5% chance to be found inside an Ornate Chest and 10% chance to be found inside a Sunken Chest. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Pick/Axes cannot be prototyped and always need to be craft near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

The Pick/Axe can be used as both a Pickaxe and an Axe, and with 33% more efficiency. A Large Evergreen will take 12 swings instead of 15. A standard Boulder takes 5 hits instead of 6. You can't save a fraction of a swing, so without other bonuses, only objects that take 5 swings or more will benefit from its efficiency. For Stone Fruits, despite it only takes one swing to crack one Stone Fruit, the player can use one swing of Pick/Axe to mine 2 Stone Fruits at once when stacked.

It has double durability of the Luxury Axe or Opulent Pickaxe: each chopping reduces durability by 0.125% (half of the 0.23% for the Luxury Axe), and each mining costs 0.33% (half of the 0.75% for the Opulent Pickaxe). This is per-swing durability without accounting for the reduction to the number of swings required to perform the same work with lesser tools.

Similar to the Brightshade Smasher, the Pick/Axe is able to mine objects that are too hard for normal tools. This includes vibrating the Cracked Pillars that keep the Nightmare Werepig in place, and mining Dreadstone Outcrops. It can also be used to mine Ryftstals without stunning the player.

## Skins

The Woven - Elegant Pickaxe Axe skin was introduced in the An Eye for An Eye update in 2021, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's Terraria. Its rarity was Inspired - Elegant initially, but received change in August 19, 202
