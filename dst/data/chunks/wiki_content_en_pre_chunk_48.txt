**Description:**
Cut Grass is a renewable resource harvested from Grass Tufts found naturally in the world. It can be used in numerous starter recipes and in even more advanced items when refined into Rope. Cut Grass is a valuable early-game resource to collect, as it is needed to craft Campfires and Torches, providing light and warmth at night.

In Winter, Cut Grass becomes a non-renewable resource, as harvested Grass Tufts will not regrow until Winter ends. Cut Grass can also be gained from crops on a Farm that is destroyed by the heat during Summer or Dry Season. Grass Tufts wither during these seasons unless protected by an Ice Flingomatic or located in a Mangrove biome, reducing access to Cut Grass. Cut Grass drops from all Tumbleweeds, making it renewable even if the player burns all the spawned Grass Tufts.

The Shoddy Tool is a special tool for Merms. Common Merms that are close to a Shoddy Tool Shed and do not have a tool in hand will craft for themselves a Shoddy Tool and equip it. If the player has a follower Merm with a Shoddy Tool, it will help you to chop trees, mine boulders, dig up stumps and dig up the beds. If a Merm without tools finds a dropped Shoddy Tool, it will pick it up.

The player can get this item from Merms that were holding it before death. However, players cannot use this tool.

# Chess Biome

The Chess Biome is a terrain that appears in both Adventure Mode and Survival Mode to protect the Wooden Thing and its components. It can be distinguished by its Checkerboard and Carpeted Flooring.

## Abundant Features
- Marble Trees
- Marble Pillars
- Evil Flowers
- Marble Sculptures
- Marble Statues
  - Sculpture Rookbody
  - Sculpture Bishopbody
  - Sculpture Knightbody
  - Marble Comedy
  - Marble Tragedy
  - Marble Vase

## Occasional Features
- Maxwell Statue
- Harp Statue
- Clockwork Knight
- Clockwork Bishop
- Clockwork Rook

## Quote
> "That's my natural habitat." - Maxwell

## Details
In Adventure Mode, there are many variations of the Chess biome design. For example, there can be a circle with Clockwork Monsters, medium to large biomes infested with clockworks (up to about a thousand can be found), to small patches of the biome with Evil Flowers. In Survival Mode, the biome appears as the large area with Clockwork Monsters and the Wooden Thing. The Chess biome that contains the Wooden Thing in Adventure Mode lacks a Clockwork Rook, only containing two Clockwork Knights and two Clockwork Bishops.

## Reign of Giants
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Chess biomes are more common in Survival Mode as a means to provide more Gears through Clockwork Monsters to players.

## Don't Starve Together
In Don't Starve Together, Chess Biomes might also have unmined Marble Sculptures and Marble Statues.

## Trivia
- The Chess biome first appeared in the Doorway to Adventure update.
- In Chapter 5 of Adventure Mode, a Chess Biome with upwards of a thousand Clockwork Monsters can sometimes be found. Due to them being so densely packed, it's unlikely the player will be able to get through without dying. Whether or not the amount spawned resulted from a bug is currently unknown.

# Panic Room Guide for Don't Starve

## What is a Panic Room?
A panic room in Don't Starve is a collection of walls built with the express intent of protecting the player from mob attacks, most notably the cyclic hound attacks that increase in intensity as the game progresses. 

## The Early Game
For beginner players, the default settings provide a period to establish a base before facing dangerous mob attacks. The challenge arises when the attack warning period becomes mere seconds, and the number of attackers multiplies. This is where a panic room becomes essential.

## Gathering Materials
The first step is to collect the necessary materials, primarily **Rocks**, which are used to create **Stone Walls** — one of the two non-flammable wall structures in the game. After surviving the first two hound attacks, there's a chance of **Fire Hounds** spawning, which can quickly turn a panic room into a burning wall of death if not built with non-flammable materials.

### Tips for Gathering
- When mining rock, it's more efficient to build 5 or 6 picks and mow down a whole field of rocks before picking anything up, allowing for faster mining by left-clicking rapidly on the rock.
- If flint supplies are adequate and only rocks are needed, mining boulders that look like those without flint have a higher chance of dropping 5 rocks per boulder, with no nitre, flint, or gold.

## Location
A well-placed panic room should be far enough from base camp resources but close enough to reach quickly during an attack. The ideal location is within 20 seconds of the base, allowing time to equip armor, helmet, and weapon.

## Design
For early game builds, a large room is not necessary as it consumes time mining rocks. A small structure with a triple-thick wall of defense is sufficient. The entrance should be narrow to funnel attackers into formation for one-on-one combat.

## Advanced Panic Planning for Boss Monsters

### Moose/Goose
- Create a 12 x 12 room full of bee-related items like bee mines and beehives.
- Lure the creature over to a pig village to combine the bees' and pigs' work to defeat the Moose/Goose.

### Bearger
- Make thin walls and 1-3 bee boxes with tooth traps around them.
- Finish setting up while kiting the Bearger in the back while the bees take the front.

### Dragonfly
- Create a panic room and drop 20 ashes in front of it.
- After it eats the ashes and goes to sleep, prepare to attack while being ready for it to set things on fire.
- Get it stuck between two rocks and kite it, using villages, herds, Tallforts, or Hound Mounds to your advantage.

### Deerclops
- Go to a pig village immediately to avoid it destroying your home.
- Set traps and make it hit in a direction where none of your stuff is.
- Befriend all pigs in the village for them to help you and increase the reward.

## Other Tips
- Don't run into the panic room immediately when the sound plays; get prepared with your armor and weapons first.
- Group the hounds and run into the panic room, then quickly turn around and dispatch them one by one to protect your walls.

Remember, setting up a panic room requires large amounts of Hound's Teeth, which can be challenging to gather early in the game but is worth creating as soon as possible.

## Quote
"Oh, joyous occasion. I've found grass." - Maxwell

## Description
The **Wild Plains** is a **Biome** exclusive to the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. The most common resource found here is **Tall Grass**, which spawns in large fields. Aggressive **Weevole**s spawn in the fields of Tall Grass at **Dusk** and **Night**, and are hardly visible because of the grass. Other resources that can be found here are **Claw Palm Tree**s, **Sapling**s, and **Stone Slab**s to flip. **Asparagus** and **Aloe** can be found planted in the ground, and can be harvested by the player, though they are not renewable. **Cave Cleft**s and **Ruinous Entrances** are also found in this biome.

Neutral **Pog** herds spawn in this biome. **Crows**, **Red Birds**, and **Kingfishers** are the only birds that spawn and land on this biome.

Wild Plains can be dug up with a **Pitchfork** and will yield **Wild Plains Turf**.

# Taming a Beefalo

Taming a Beefalo is a long, arduous project. Make sure you think it's worth it before doing this. That being said, taming a **Beefalo** has many benefits - increased movement speed, damage, and some other rather specific quirks. For example, say you are lugging the **Suspicious Marble** around, but it is far from the **Marble Sculptures** themselves. Riding a Beefalo while carrying it will make the long, slow walk not so slow anymore. So, get the materials needed. (Note: This guide is a work in progress, so check for more details later.)[![Beefalo Tendencies](File:Beefalo_Tendencies.jpg)](#)

## Statistics and Tendencies

Taming a Beefalo requires some knowledge of the inside statistics. There are three you need to look out for: Hunger, Obedience, and Domestication. 

- **Hunger**: How full your Beefalo is, and it is very important. Beefalo lose hunger very quickly, so you will need a large **Berry Bush**, **Sapling**, or **Grass Tuft** farm. You can also use **Crock Pot** dishes, but this isn't recommended because of the time and effort needed to consistently feed your Beefalo with these. I recommend using twigs, as they grow pretty quickly and feed more than cut grass.
- **Obedience**: What you can do with the Beefalo. It has a maximum of 100. When it's over 10, you can saddle the Beefalo. When it's over 50, you can ride the Beefalo. The Beefalo will however shake off the saddle when Obedience is less than 40, so be careful. Obedience constantly decreases at a rate of 50 a day but is increased by 40 when you use a **Brush** on it (highly recommended), and 10 when you feed it. Being overfed will decrease it by 30, starving for an entire day will remove all Obedience, and being shaved or attacked by the player will as well. Being attacked by other things will reduce it by 1.
- **Domestication**: The focus of this entire process. At 100% Domestication, you will see a fourth stat that isn't really a stat: Tendency. Depending on what you do with your Beefalo, different tendencies appear. The **Ornery Beefalo** will deal more damage and appears if you fight with your Beefalo and have him tank some damage. The **Rider tendency** will appear when you ride your Beefalo around nonstop. My personal favorite, he has a noticeable speed boost. The **Pudgy tendency** will appear when you feed your Beefalo a lot or even overfeed it. He will grant a large sanity boost of 6.8 per minute.

## Process of Taming

Taming this hairy helper is no minor task, for it takes around 20-25 days of feeding and riding some beast, but it could take as little as 15 days if you know what you are doing. Luckily, this will tell you the forbidden knowledge on just that.

The first thing you will likely want to consider is tendencies. All tendencies take the same domestication time, but might be harder to pull off compared to others. A averagely complex summary: you are going to need to keep a full 40 twigs on you at all times, as food for the beefalo so it will like you. Bonding it to a bell is a must (for myself anyways), or otherwise it will just run off eventually and your work will be wasted. You will need a saddle to ride around on your underling, but if you are skilled in killing pigs, then the pig skin is probably the hardest part for it. Also, if you are early in the game, I recommend you to forgo the brush (the walrus tusk is a chance drop from the dangerous Mactusk, and the steel wool comes from the queen of kiting: an Ewecus.) and instead just feed it and ride it as much as you can. Keep your own food for yourself, and just keep feeding the beefalo the twigs, unless the food is starting to go stale, then I recommend it.

Recently, Don’t Starve Together has released two new food exclusively for beefalo, which are **Steamed Twigs** and **Beefalo Treats**. I recommend only making the twigs only if you immediately feed them to the beefalo, as the steamed version spoils yet has vastly superior hunger to its ingredients of 4 twigs. I can’t remember the recipe for the treats, but I do remember that it was mainly a health food so it shouldn’t be made unless going into battle.

# Major Options in Don't Starve

## No Tech
- Build an **axe**, **pickaxe**, **torch**, **campfire**, and not a **garland**.
- Chop **trees** for **logs** and **Pine Cone|pine cones**, mine boulders for rocks and **gold**.

## Science Machine
- Build a **Science Machine|science machine** without choosing a base location, and then some combination of **backpack**, **spear**, **Log Suit|log suit**, **shovel**, and **hammer**.
- Hammer the science machine, and keep exploring. One of the primary goals of the hammer is to get **Pig Skin|pig skins** out of **Pig Head|pig heads**.
- Burn a forest and collect the charcoal. Use the shovel to dig up some or all of twigs, berry bushes, and grass tufts.
- After choosing a base location, build a firepit, crockpot, drying rack(s), chest(s), and lightning rod. Place traps on rabbit holes.
- Read the [Crock Pot](http://dontstarve.wikia.com/wiki/Crock_Pot) page – this is one of the most useful pages on the wiki. Plant pine cones and the other items.
- Fight spiders using traps or weapons to collect the silk, spider glands, and monster meat. Monster meat enables a few crock pot recipes and at least serves as filler for the others.
- Secure a source of repeatable healing. The best options are a bee box for honey nuggets/honey ham (requires silk for the bug net), frogs + mushrooms for froggie bunwich (requires ponds), a fishing pole for fish sticks (requires silk for the fishing pole and ponds), farms (requires manure), and drying racks for jerky.

## Alchemy Engine
- Get lots of gold and tech to the alchemy engine. The main options for gold are hacking lots of rocks, and giving meats or trinkets to the Pig King or Wolly.
- Pig skins are now highly valuable. The ham bat and especially the football helmet are huge fighting upgrades. Consider a piggyback and pig houses with the leftovers.
- There are three main options for meat: Beefalo, werepigs, and tallbirds, and they all require fights that could easily prove fatal.

## Magic
- Build a Prestihatitator. Build a meat effigy, which requires meat and shaving a sufficiently long beard. In fact build 2 but only place 1.
- Fight the chess pieces to get gears, marble, and the wooden thing.
- Dig graves to get gems and gears. With gears, the choices are an ice box or a divination rod. Blue gems can be made into ice staffs – this is generally more efficient than darts for fights requiring ranged weapons.

## Winter Preparation
- Plan A is a beefalo hat. This requires fighting about 3 beefalo, depending on drops. Plan B is a winter hat – the wool could come from shaving beefalo at night, thus avoiding the fight. The backup plan is rabbit ear muffs. It’s always useful to get 1 or 2 thermal stones.

## Looking for Trouble
- Hunt a Koalefant to make a vest. Fight MacTusk n' Son and hope for an awesome hat or a tusk for a walking cane. Make Krampus angry. All of these require either ranged weapons, good combat gear, or understanding of how to kite and drop aggro.

## Advanced Magic
- Teching to shadow manipulator requires three things: a purple gem, living logs, and nightmare fuel.
- The Dark Sword, Night Armor, and Fire Staff are all significant fighting upgrades. Given enough nightmare fuel, make a nightmare amulet, go insane, and collect more nightmare fuel.

## Boss Fights
- Prepare the battlefield. It could have any or all of strategically placed walls, tooth traps, fire pits, bee bombs, pig houses, beefalo, and even a treeguard.

## Harder Ways to Play
- Explore the caves. Go through Maxwell’s door. Change sandbox settings so there are more hostile creatures and less resources. There’s no need to defeat all of the bosses or learn the shadow manipulator toys before trying these.

- WX-78: THEY SPRAY TOXIC ODOR CLOUDS

- Warly: Ew, smells like its insides have gone bad.
- Woodlegs: Back ye foul stink-shooters!
- Wilba: 'TIS A STINKY FISH
- Wormwood: Smelly Glub Glub
- Wheeler: Swell. The most horrible parts of skunks and sting-rays put together.
- Choose: Webber

**Stink Rays** are hostile **Mobs** found in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC that can spawn while out in the sea. They will first be found submerged as a shadow in the shape of a stingray and will surface when a player comes close to the Stink Ray. Once surfaced, the Stink Ray will alert other nearby Stink Rays and follow the player to an extent along with the other Stink Rays.

They can expel a poisonous gas at the player, causing them to be **poison**ed. The poison may be reversed with the use of **Anti Venom**. They have no attack aside from the poisonous gas. They can drop either a **Venom Gland** or **Monster Meat**.

Each Stink Ray pod can have up to 6 Stink Rays. They respawn after 60 seconds when killed. Stink Rays will start spawning after 5 to 10 days of creation of a new world.

**Fighting Strategy:**
{{Weapon Hits|health=50|icestaff=2|sleepdart=2|water=yes}}

**Tips:**
- Compared to other poisonous creatures stink rays have a very high drop rate of poison glands, an essential ingredient in Anti Venom.
- Wearing a **Particulate Purifier** will prevent the player from being poisoned by the Stink Ray.
- Due to their low damage and health, Stink Rays are a good way to obtain Venom Glands for Anti Venom when the player character is already poisoned.
- If the player is playing as **WX-78**, Stink Rays can be very useful for them to hunt. WX-78 is immune to poison, so they cannot damage them, and killing them can potentially spawn **Floaty Boaty Knights** which drop **gears**.

**Trivia:**
- "Stink Ray" is a portmanteau of the words "Stink" and "Stingray".
- The Stink Rays seem to have the tail and pattern of a **skunk**, an animal famous for its ability to squirt a foul smelling liquid in self-defense.
- The Stink Rays used to have both a melee poisonous attack and a gas attack. This was removed in the **Seas The Day** update.
- Stink Rays have a mouth on their underbelly, shown in an animated segment of the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** [Launch Trailer](https://youtu.be/mScnLxvFEWg?t=47s). The mouth can also be seen when they attack, come out of the water, or die.

- **Maxwell**: I don't recognize that one.
- **Wagstaff**: There's a strange relation between birds and the proximity of seeds here.
- **Wigfrid**: This bird knows about the cold.
- **Webber**: What pretty white feathers.
- **Walani**: You have a lovely voice!
- **Warly**: This little fellow seems quite frigid.

- **Wurt**: Snowy bird.
- **Wortox**: That's a bird, or so I've heard.
- **Walter**: My handbook doesn't show them in this colour...
- **Wanda**: Some kind of blueish white bird.

## Behavior and Interactions
Snowbirds appear only in Winter and land mostly on Grassland. They peck the ground for a few moments before flying away. When killed, they drop a Morsel or an Azure Feather, and nearby birds will fly away. Killing a Snowbird adds 1 point to the player's naughtiness level.

### Usage
- **Hand**: Morsel or Azure Feather
- **Fire**: Cooked Morsel

### Hunting
Birds can be caught using a Bird Trap. They can be killed in inventory to produce a Feather or Morsel, or cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel. They can be imprisoned in Bird Cages.

### Tips
- Wearing a Feather Hat increases the number of Birds spawning and decreases the time between spawns.
- Using "Birds of the World" (as Wickerbottom) causes a large number of them to land.
- Birds take one blast from the Ice Staff to be frozen and one Sleep Dart to be put to sleep.

## Trivia
- The Snowbird is referenced as a "Winter Robin" or "Junco" in game files.
- The Snowbird's coloration and crest are reminiscent of the Blue Jay.
- Woodie strongly dislikes birds.
- Maxwell mentions that he doesn't recognize the Snowbird and doesn't know how the Crows got to the island.

# Armor in Don't Starve and DST

_Note: The [[Void Masque]]'s masques need to be added_

## Navigation
- [Don't Starve Armor](Armor/DS)
- [DST Armor](Armor/DST)

## See also
- [Weapons in DST](Weapon/DST)

## Overview
Armor is a type of in-game [[Items|Item]] that mitigates damage and protects the character from harm. It works by absorbing a portion of incoming hit damage in place of the wearer's (character or mob) [[Health]], and loses [[Durability]] based on damage it blocked.

Armor generally has two stats called '''Protection''' and '''Planar Defense''', which used to block [[Physical Damage]] and [[Planar Damage]] respectively for the mob or character they are equipped with. Other sources of damage such as [[Food]], [[Fire]], Temperature ([[Overheating]] or [[Freezing]]) or [[Crafting]] cannot be absorbed by armor. 

For complete defense information, please refer to [[Damage/DST#Armor|Damage]].

## Fog

Fog is a mechanic found in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked (SW)** and **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLCs. The behavior of fog varies between these two DLCs:

- **Ocean Fog** serves as the world border in Shipwrecked.
- **Heavy Fog** is a significant mechanic during the **Humid Season** in Hamlet.

Notably, passing through fog in Shipwrecked will teleport you to the direct opposite side of the map. Heavy Fog will slow your movement if you are wearing any item other than the **Pith Hat**.

# Halloween Candies

Halloween Candies are exclusive food items for the **Hallowed Nights** event in **Don't Starve Together**. They are dropped by the Pig King after any valid trade during the event. The Pig King will give more candy per trade if the player is wearing a costume skin. These candies restore varying amounts of Health, Hunger, and Sanity when eaten, stack up to 40 items, and do not spoil over time. The available candies and their spawn codes are as follows:

# Deciduous Forest

The **Deciduous Forest**, also known as the **Birchnut Forest**, is a **Biome** found in the **Reign of Giants** DLC. It is very similar to the regular **Forest** biome, with the exception that all the trees are **Birchnut Trees**, which produce **Birchnuts**, and the ground is covered with **Deciduous Turfs**. The Deciduous Forest also exclusively spawns **Glommer's Statue**, which spawns **Glommer**, and **Hollow Stumps**, inhabited by **Catcoons**. Catcoons spawn more often here than in other biomes due to the number of Hollow Stumps.

**Fireflies** are more abundant in the Deciduous Forest than in any other biome, so much so that any section of the forest will likely have two or more patches.

This biome is a great source of **Mushrooms**. In fact, all mushrooms (Red, Blue, and Green) can grow here, exclusively making this biome the only surface biome that is capable of having all three types.

# The Lore of Don't Starve

The lore of the world surrounding Don't Starve has been mainly revealed through **game update trailers**, **character examination quotes**, the **Adventure Mode** in the base **Don't Starve** game, and through outside-game activities known as **"Puzzles"**.

This guide intends to walk the reader through the lore of the universe roughly in the order that it was released and through the mediums that it was released so that the reader may experience the enjoyment of "discovering" the information themself as it was originally revealed.

## First humans to the Constant

Most of the Don't Starve lore focuses around humans from the "real world" being transported to a mysterious new land known as **"The Constant"**.

### William Carter Puzzles

The earliest Don't Starve lore was revealed through text that the developers, **Klei**, would hide in their game update **video trailers**. This text in the trailers would spell out website URLs that contained images gradually telling a story of **Maxwell**'s days before being transported to the Constant. These hidden images are collectively known as the **William Carter Puzzles**.

The William Carter puzzles tell the story of a man named William Carter, who would later become Maxwell.

# Go for the eyes! - Wilson

When exploring the world of Don't Starve, it is inevitable that the player will stumble upon monsters that can pose a threat or are there to kill them. This WIP guide is designed to assist players in dealing with monsters in all situations, rain or snow.

## Equipment
While your character can actually brawl and punch enemies to death, most playable characters in Don't starve are not known for their physical prowess and even the smallest of the enemies will easily outdamage and kill your character if unprepared, so you'll need weapons for dealing damage, and armor for your character to wear for protection.

### Weapons
Almost every item that the character can wield in his/her hands can be used as a weapon (except for Divining rods). From fishing rods to pickaxes, and from walking canes to dark swords, every item that can be placed in the Hands slot of a certain character has its own damage value and can be used to hit enemies. This section will not cover traps, since their main usage is for stationary defenses.

#### Melee Weapons
- Most tools in the game (Axes, Pickaxes, Shovels,...) can be used as weapons. While their damage is sub-par and each hit makes them lose durability, they're still a decent way of dealing damage and their gold variation makes them renewable, provided a Pig King is spawned or you go spelunking from time to time.
- A good starting main weapon for the game is the Spear, as it is easily able to be crafted and it does a fair amount of damage against most enemies. Because flint is a renewable resource due to earthquakes in caves, the spear is a renewable weapon. Another powerful weapon is Ham Bat, which requires pig skin, meat, and twigs to craft. This can be easily crafted by killing a Werepig and then gathering the necessary amount of twigs.
- A preferred weapon for the entire game is the Tentacle Spike. While the player probably will not actively farm Tentacles for their spikes, one should always be on the lookout in swamp biomes for traces of nearby battles (like silk, glands, rot, fish, monster meat...). Swamp denizens like Spiders, Merms, and Tentacles can spend their days engaging in fights with each other, so lots of loot can be found in swamps around their chosen battlefield. As long as tentacles are involved, there's a decent chance for a spike or two to be found nearby.
- The most damaging weapon in the game is the Dark Sword, but due to the difficulty in crafting it and the fact that wielding it gradually reduces sanity, causes the Dark Sword to be dangerous to those not prepared for the sanity drain. It can be used most effectively in boss fights, as the player's sanity will be drained anyways, times when one wants to lower one's sanity to fight shadow creatures, or when playing Maxwell.
- Finally, while weaker than most tools (see above), the Walking Cane can be used as a great weapon since it has no durability and thus can never be destroyed. The cane may be especially useful for destroying structures (ex. Spider Dens) and easily kiteable enemies (ex. Koalefants) that require a large number of hits to be destroyed or killed. It will also give the wielder a speed boost to make kiting easier.

#### Ranged Weapons
- The most basic ranged weapon your character will use is the Boomerang. Its main utility is to engage "frightened-type" enemies (such as Koalefants and Gobblers), and to grant safer first strikes against enemies you need to isolate for any reason (Chess Monsters, Beefalo). Boomerangs return to your character once they strike their target, and you need to "catch" it; if your character stays stationary after the boomerang has been thrown, you may just hold down the Spacebar button and you will catch it automatically, but in case you move your character the boomerang will "home in" to your new location and you will have to time a Spacebar press to catch it manually. If you fail the catch, the boomerang will hit you in return, damage your character while losing more durability, and fall to the ground.
- Darts are the second most useful ranged weapons in the game and are somewhat easy to craft. There are three different types of darts, each one requiring two Cut Reeds (gathered around swamp biomes) a type of bird feather (dependent on the dart type), and an extra component (dependent on the dart type). Each dart has only one use, but darts can stack up to x20 for every kind.
  - Blow Darts: Deals heavy damage to a single target. Will kill most non-boss creatures with 3 to 5 darts. The entire MacTusk N' Son hunting party can potentially be killed with only five darts, since each dart does

# Bee Queen

**Don't Starve Together Exclusive Boss Monster**

![Bee Queen](Bee_Queen.png){width=150px}

The Bee Queen is a Boss Monster exclusive to *Don't Starve Together*, introduced in *A New Reign*. She has the appearance of a gigantic Bee with two large wings, a stinger, black and yellow stripes on her thorax and a beehive on her abdomen. The Bee Queen is spawned after a Gigantic Beehive is hammered sufficiently. She will emerge from the hive, leaving a honey blotch behind. She immediately spawns Grumble Bees, and will auto-target any player that approaches.

## Stats

- **Health**: 22500
- **Damage**: 60 (to players), 120 (to mobs)
- **Attack Period**: 2
- **Attack Range**: 4
- **Walk Speed**: 5.6
- **Spawns from**: ![Gigantic Beehive](24|Gigantic Beehive)

## Drops

- Honey ×3-4
- Honeycomb ×1-2
- Stinger ×1
- Royal Jelly ×6-7
- Bee Queen Crown
- Rare Blueprint for Bundling Wrap
- Sketch for Bee Queen Figure (Marble)

## Quotes

- Wilson: "Keep that stinger away from me!"
- Willow: "No amount of honey is worth THAT!"
- Wolfgang: "Is giant lady bee!"
- Wendy: "As regal as she is ruthless..."
- WX78: "THE PRIME BEE"
- Wickerbottom: "The workers ferociously protect her."
- Woody: "Bees got no business getting that big."
- Maxwell: "I didn't make that one! Really!"
- Wigfrid: "Yöur mönarchy shall töpple this day!"
- Webber: "Bees aren't our friends!"
- Winona: "It's the queen of bees!"
- Warly: "Your honey was too delicious not to steal!"
- Wortox: "Tweeheehe! You're a big bee!"
- Wormwood: "Big Mommy Buzz!"
- Wurt: "Queen of stingers!!"
- Walter: "If I make friends with their queen, maybe the bees won't sting me!"
- Wanda: "This was a terrible idea!"

## Behavior

The Bee Queen attacks by initially spawning 4-5 Grumble Bees at a time. In close range, the Bee Queen can stab the player with her stinger, dealing 60 damage. Since she is considered a bee, the damage she deals is reduced by a Beekeeper Hat.

## Strategy

One of the most common, yet also very resource expensive tactics used to defeat the Bee Queen, is to construct around 20-30 Rabbit Hutches. The player(s) can construct them near the Gigantic Beehive so that the Bunnymen can engage on Bee Queen's awakening.

A more classic and simple way to deal with the Bee Queen is to use two or more Pan Flutes along with a classic equipment to sleep the Bee Queen and the Grumble Bees when enraged, and then completely focus on the main target while landing hits.

## Honey Trail

Her attacks spawn honey at where attack location for a short amount of time that can slow players movement speed. Because of this, players should avoid going back to the same location after each dodge, instead, go back to a slightly different spot.

## Trivia

- The Bee Queen was introduced in the *Cute Fuzzy Animals* update.
- The Bee Queen is the second boss to have her own battle music, the first being Toadstool.
- Her screech attack will scare Pigs, Bunnymen, Merms and Spiders.
- Bee Queen and her Grumble Bees appear to follow blooming Wormwood's flower trail.

# Iron Hulk

The Iron Hulk is a [Mob] exclusive to the [Don't Starve: Hamlet] DLC. It comes in the form of a head, ribs, arm, and foot.

## Behavior

When first found in the world, the Iron Hulks will be covered with moss and foliage, presumably because they have been dormant for quite some time. They will come to life and attack the player or anything nearby when mined with a Pickaxe. They can also be stirred to life with lightning, which keeps them activated for a longer period of time than if they were mined. During the [Aporkalypse], the Iron Hulks will remain activated constantly.

There are six different parts to be found: a head, a torso, two legs, and two arms. The arm and torso are by far the most devastating ones, as they will shoot a giant laser beam that procs small explosions in a straight line, which can cause immense damage, and if unarmored, can instantly kill the player. These lasers will also light structures, plants, and mobs on fire. The head and the leg will perform a smash attack, where they will leap at their target and smash down, doing a small AOE attack that also starts fires, and can proc multiple times if an entity is closer to the center of the attack.

The player can, however, farm [Iron Ore] by mining them repeatedly. Since their attack AI targets the player's location only when they start their attack animation, the player can occasionally hit them when they're still active.

## Large Iron Hulk

The Large Iron Hulk is a [Boss Monster]. It is the result of the player activating every piece and leading them all to the same place. As soon as the last piece reaches the pile, the Large Iron Hulk will wake up and the fight will begin. The boss has a variety of attacks, including launching 3-5 proximity mines around the boss, throwing a ball of fire at the player, spinning around firing a laser, and forming a ring of Basalt Eruptions around the boss. The Large Iron Hulk also has a melee attack in which it jams its mouth into the ground, as well as a short range teleport.

Upon death, the Large Iron Hulk will explode and spawn all of the pieces in random locations around the island it died on, excluding the head which will land directly where the boss died; the Iron Hulk cannot be permanently killed. All landmines and basalt eruptions will remain where they are until something destroys them. The Large Iron Hulk will drop 2~4 [Gears], 2~6 [Iron Ore], 6~7 [Infused Iron], as well as the [Blueprint] for the [Living Artifact].

## Examination Quotes

- Wilson: I'm heading out of here!
- Willow: Ugly.
- Wolfgang: Is big head. Wolfgang head is bigger!
- Wendy: Headed to death, like all of us.
- WX78: IN SLEEP MODE
- Wickerbottom: The skull of an iron automata.

## Tips

- It is recommended to mine the ribs. Although they do the most damage, their attacks are the easiest to dodge. The ribs also have a longer pause between attacks, allowing the player to mine it for longer without dodging attacks.
- The biome Iron Hulks are found in are often next to Thunderbirds. This can cause the Iron Hulks to be struck by lightning, awakening them and often wreaking havoc to nearby mobs.

The **Wilds** is one of the [biomes](#) found in the [Ruins](#). These are the areas on which the [Ancient Civilization](#) did not set up any structures, the only hint of their activity being paths of [Runic Turf](#) leading to other biomes and the entrance to the Ruins, with the rest of the turf being exclusively [Mud Turf](#).

Common elements found in the Wilds include [Cave Lichen](#), [Pond](#)s, [Light Flower](#)s, [Slurper](#)s, Blue [Mushroom](#)s, and [Nightmare Light#Nightmare Fissure](#)s. This biome is also infested with [Depths Worm](#)s scattered randomly across this biome, waiting to ambush the player.

## Don't Starve Together

In 'Don't Starve Together', Light Flowers, Cave Lichen, and Ponds are much more common. Additionally, [Lesser Glow Berry](#)s spawn frequently.

- Similar to Monster Meat, the cooked version of Coffee Beans lasts 250% longer. It is therefore advised to cook it as soon as possible before storing it for later use. This also prevents the player from accidentally using raw Coffee Beans when trying to make Coffee.

# Don't Starve Survival Guide

## Game Screen
Below is a labeled game screen with HUD (Heads-Up-Display). (Note: Sanity/Hunger are in the wrong order)

![Game Screen](Game Screen.png?raw=true "Players' normal game screen.")

### Health
Displays how much damage the player can take. When it reaches 0, it causes the player's Death or Resurrection.

### Hunger
Tracks how full the player's stomach is. When empty, the player will experience constant health loss (similar to Freezing or Overheating). This will continue until the player consumes a Food item that refills hunger or dies.

### Spoilage
If the player keeps food for too long without eating it, the food item will begin to spoil and rot. The item in the inventory will start as a fresh (Green) item if it can spoil. It will first turn stale (Yellow), then spoil (Red), and finally turn into an inedible pile of Rot which can be used as weak fertilizer for Farms and Plants.

Each stage of spoilage will diminish the positive effects of the food and will eventually add a negative effect to it (i.e., Sanity loss). These effects do not apply to WX-78.

The spoilage rate will double if the food is left on the ground, or it can be cut in half if it is placed in an Ice Box. You can also give it more durability by stacking it with fresher food.

DLCs and DST introduce the Wetness mechanic, causing food to become wet if not protected. Soggy food spoils 30% faster.

### Sanity
This keeps track of the player's current Sanity level. When Sanity drops, numerous things happen based on the current amount. As it falls, the screen will begin to distort and shake, and eyes will soon begin to appear at night (Sanity ≤ 60%). The distortion will continue until the Sanity level falls below 50%. Below this, the player can see Shadow Creatures (shadow-like monsters and Beardlings). If their Sanity level drops below 15%, the character will start to hold their head in pain, and the Shadow Creatures will begin to attack the player without provocation (except for Beardlings).

Common actions that will reduce a player's Sanity are eating raw Meats and Monster Meat, traveling through Worm Holes, staying in complete darkness, or fighting certain monsters. Actions that will increase the player's Sanity are eating Crock Pot food (like Taffy and Pumpkin Cookies), eating Cooked food, picking Flowers, wearing certain Dress items, sleeping through the night, etc.

### Day/Night Cycle
On the HUD, a circular object will show the player exactly how much in-game time they will have left before the time of day changes to Dusk, Night, or Day.

The day will slowly turn to Dusk, then Night, and then again back to Day. This cycle will repeat infinitely, but the length of each stage will change depending on the current season (see below).

### Summer & Winter
Summer and Winter are the two seasons in Don't Starve (there are four in the Reign of Giants DLC as well as DST; Autumn and Spring). During these seasons, the amount of Day, Dusk, and Night that will be left in a Day will differ.

Summer does not have much of a change from the game's normal state besides the change in Day times. Winter, however, is drastically different.

During Winter:

- The types of Animals and Monsters will either change entirely or just their coat color
- The player is capable of Freezing to death
- The hostile Deerclops boss will occasionally spawn
- The duo of Mactusk N' Son will spawn from Walrus Camps (with 2 Blue Hounds)

Winter is a very hostile season, so it is recommended that the player prepare before it begins. One of the easiest ways is hunting a Koalefant before the night starts. When you find it, wait until night and kill it while it's sleeping. You will get a Koalefant Trunk which with 8 Silk can be turned into a Breezy Vest. A Winter Koalefant Trunk can be turned crafted into a Puffy Vest using 8 Silk and 2 Beefalo Wool.

### Moon Cycle
If players are looking at the Clock at night, a small moon phase can be observed. On a full moon, normal Pigs will become Werepigs, which are hostile and dangerous to players. Therefore, it is recommended that players not visit Pig Villages or befriend Pigs on a full moon. If the player's camp resides near a Pig Village or in the center of one, the light produced during the full moon segment can be used to escape from the Village before the Pigs transform. In Reign of Giants, however, many things can happen on a

### Description
Woby (pronounced WOH-bee) is a mob in Don't Starve Together, exclusive to the character Walter. She appears with Walter and follows him everywhere. She has no health hence cannot be killed.

Woby has a small and a big form. Both forms have 9 inventory slots just like Chester. Both forms have a maximum of 50 hunger. The hunger is lost at a rate of 20 hunger per day (full belly lasts for 2.5 days). Her diet consists of any Monster Food. Small Woby spawns with 0 hunger. Upon feeding her to at least 95% max hunger (which is 47.5) she will turn into big form. She will turn back to Small form upon reaching 0 hunger.

Walter is able to ride Big Woby (just like domesticated Beefalo). She cannot be saddled. Her run speed is affected by the level of hunger as per the table below.

| Hunger | Speed |
|--------|-------|
| 35 - 50 | 10    |
| 16.5 - 34 | 9    |
| 1 - 33 | 8     |

She will buck a player off if she receives damage, an animation that will leave the player vulnerable while they are getting up off the ground. When Walter is in combat, she will run a distance and cower when not being ridden

The **Usher** is a Pig Trader Mob exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. He will give the player four Oincs for various sweets, but only once per day.

A player can exploit the gaining of oincs by buying berries from the grocery store for one oinc each, then trading the berries with the Usher for four more oincs, leaving a net gain of 3 oincs from each Usher per day. Assuming the grocery store has berries in stock, this makes berry bushes much less useful for oinc farming. Likewise, he will pay 4 oincs for Pumpkin Cookies, which cost 3 oincs at the Deli.

## Behavior
One Usher may spawn from a Town House and will wander randomly around their house and eat any edible items left on the ground, including Pig Skin. Every so often they will drop one Manure where they are standing, and if the player picks up that manure the Usher will approach them and give them one Oinc, along with an accompanying Quote.

Whenever there is a hostile mob nearby, or a player targets them or another Pig Trader or Royal Guard near them, they will enter a panicked state. They will begin to move around semi-randomly in a direction away from the aggressor.

They will attempt to return to their house in the evening, and if they cannot reach their house or their house is destroyed they will seek the nearest light source and stand next to it until night, when they will sleep on the ground.

- **WX-78:** "HANGING PART"

## Behavior
The Mob Hanging Vine is aggressive and can dislodge items from a player's inventory when it attacks, similar to the Frog, Poison Dartfrog, or Piko. It also consumes any food found on the ground.

## Fighting Strategy
- Mob Hanging Vine cannot be frozen with an Ice Staff nor put to sleep with Sleep Darts.
- Due to their low damage, players can equip a high-stack item like Grass in the first slot to absorb damage. Alternatively, placing food nearby can distract them as Hanging Vines prioritize eating over attacking.

## Tips
- It is challenging to differentiate between plant Hanging Vines and mob Hanging Vines. Mob Hanging Vines are brown-green with spikes, while plant Hanging Vines are brown with leaves.
- Players can use harmful food items like Red Mushroom and Monster Meat near the Hanging Vines, causing them to eat and potentially die.

# Pinacle Biome

## Exclusivity to Hamlet
The Pinacle Biome is exclusive to the Hamlet DLC.

## Biome Features
- **Image:** ![BFB's Nest Biome](BFB's%20Nest%20Biome.png)
- **Abundant:** Weathered Trees, Weathered Shrubs, Weathered Branches, Weathered Sticks, Crows
- **Occasional:** Weathered House, Rusty Lamp, Weathered Trunk, Petrified Eggs
- **Rare:** Boulder, Regal Scepter, Sinkhole, Tallbird

## Quote
> "What a mess." - Maxwell

## Description
The Pinacle Biome is a biome located on a separate island, with its own plants, structures, and most noticeably the BFB's Nest. The player gains access to the island after being caught and transported to it by the BFB. The player will always spawn in the BFB's Nest after being transported. The journey will make the character lose a bit of sanity, just like a Wormhole would do.

## Resources and Objects
Players can find Rocks, Flint, and Twigs, along with Weathered shrubs, trees, and branches. This is the only biome in which the Regal Scepter is located. A single Sinkhole spawns somewhere in this biome, providing an exit from the island. Rarely, a Tallfort setpiece will be found here as well.

## Cave System
Mining the sinkhole leads to a cave system similar to the Ancient Pig Ruins and Mant Hill, consisting of a series of connected rooms. These rooms can have Mushtrees, Light Flowers, Ferns, Unimportant Pillars, and Stalagmites in them. In one of the rooms there will be a Stone Plug in the middle of the back wall. Mining this rock will trigger a single Earthquake, which will create a passage out of the caves. This passage will lead to one Cave Cleft on any of the other 4 islands, regardless of whether or not it had been explored. The passage can then be entered from the Cave Cleft to take the player back to the BFB's Island again.

## Terrain
It is covered in Rocky Turf which can be dug up with a Pitchfork. Crows are birds that land in this biome.

## BFB's Nest
### Object Infobox
- **Image:** ![BFB's Nest](BFB's%20Nest.png)
- **Resources:** Stone Egg
- **Renew:** Cannot be destroyed
- **Biome:** Pinacle
- **Spawn Code:** "roc_nest"

The heart of BFB's Nest consists of 4 Petrified Eggs and a Stone Egg (which will hatch into a Ro Bin). It is surrounded by a Weathered House, Rusty Lamp, Weathered Trunk, some Weathered Trees, branches, sticks, and shrubs. The Petrified Eggs can be mined for 3 items, which will either be Rocks, Red Gems, Blue Gems, or Purple Gems.

## Tips
- Players should not be concerned if they arrive without a Pickaxe. Every resource needed to make one is available on the island, likely to make sure that players are not trapped on it because they cannot mine the Sinkhole.
- The Cave Cleft that connects to the cave is randomly selected when the Stone Plug is mined, not during world generation. This might prove extremely useful, if the player got to the BFB island in the early days using a Bird Whistle and immediately land on the Palace Island with the regal scepter to give to the Pig Queen.
- It isn't a bad idea to Telelocator Staff the Iron Hulk here, as all of his pieces will land in extremely close proximity, allowing for easy farming of Gears, Iron, and Living Artifacts.

## Trivia
- Sometimes there are Tallbirds on this island.
- "Pinacle" is either a misspelling of the word "pinnacle" or a reference to an obsolete form of the word.
- It was previously possible to find 2 Regal Scepters simultaneously on the same island, but this was later fixed.

## Usage

## Tips
- Ensure bait-trapping Birds on the specific Turf for specific Feathers.

- Cooking Birds alive provides a guaranteed Cooked Morsel.
- Players with a damage modifier < 1 can use Boomerangs to prevent Birds from being killed with one hit.

## Trivia
- **Woodie** strongly dislikes birds.
- **Wickerbottom** refers to several of the birds by their scientific names.

## Bugs
- Birds can sometimes "land on" objects and mobs that are otherwise obstacles, such as Campfires.

## Mobs
- Pigeon is categorized under animals in the game.
