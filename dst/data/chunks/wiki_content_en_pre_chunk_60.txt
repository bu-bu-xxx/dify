# Mr. Skitts

![Mr. Skitts Image](Mr. Skits.png)

**Spawn Code:** `shadowskittish`

Mr. Skitts is a small, serpent-like Shadow Creature that can appear at any time while the player's Sanity is below 82.5%. He cannot attack or be attacked. When approached, he will turn and slither away, disappearing from the screen. His only purpose is to remind players of their Sanity level and provide a scare.

- Mr. Skitts will sometimes flicker on the screen for a fraction of a second, then disappear.
- He can also be seen flying into [[Obelisk]]s as they are raised and flying back out of them when they are lowered.
- He can also be seen coming out of chests in trapped set pieces and ornate chests when the player opens them, springing the trap.

## Trivia

### In-Game
- A group of Mr. Skitts will briefly appear when [[Maxwell (character)|Maxwell]] summons a puppet using his [[Codex Umbra]].
- Mr. Skitts was shown as the "author" of the [[Lost Fragment]] mod.
- Although Shadow Creatures cannot be examined, there are unused examination quotes for Swimming Horrors and Mr. Skittish in the game files.

### Lore
- Shadow Creatures make several appearances throughout the [[William Carter Puzzles]].
  - Mr. Skitts and a Terrorbeak appear briefly in an intermission animation in the eighth puzzle.

In **Don't Starve Together**, Dragonfly is no longer tied to Summer. Instead, she is present year-round as part of **Dragonfly Nest** in the **Desert**. Upon death, she will also drop all types of **Gems**, **Gold Nugget**s, **Lavae Egg**(s), a blueprint for a **Scaled Furnace**, and a **Sketch** for a **Dragonfly Figure** in addition to Meat and Scales.

Dragonfly also increases her freezing threshold by two each time she is frozen, and has four added to the threshold when enraged.

Dragonfly's year-round presence makes her an effective but dangerous way to get rid of other giants. On the other hand, due to Dragonfly's year-round presence, utilizing the other Giants strength to heavily damage Dragonfly is a viable strategy.

If Dragonfly is attacked by a nearby enemy and any player is nearby, Dragonfly will target them after killing the enemy that attacked her, even if the player is not fighting her in any way.

## Behavior

Dragonfly will wander within 15 units of its own spawner point. If it leaves this range, the dragonfly will try to fly back.

Dragonfly will actively attack only the player.

If the dragonfly flies away and disappears, the Dragonfly spawner point will immediately refresh a new dragonfly:
- Dragonfly is more than 60 units away from her spawner point;
- More than 4 units away from land;
- Server reset (rollback, single exit reenter, etc.).

If Dragonfly is killed, she will re-spawn 20 days later (with the default World Generation setting for Dragonfly, 10 days if setting is "more", and 5 days for "lots", 40 days for "less").

## Combat

Dragonfly will always spawn **Lavae** when reaching 80%, 50% and 20% of her Max HP. However, if all the larvae die before reaching the next thresholds, she may spawn more. Lavae are spawned from the Magma pools within range (approximately 13 pitchforks) of Dragonfly when she attempts to spawn them. The order is random and she will often revisit pools. If no pools are within range she will spawn them where she is.

The number of Lavae spawned is 5 during the first wave, and increases by one for each subsequent wave. The rate at which they

An **Eggplant** is an uncommon vegetable that can be farmed from Basic Farms and Improved Farms by planting Seeds for an 11% chance of growing or using Eggplant Seeds (Swirly Seeds). It can be used as an ingredient in several Crock Pot recipes. Feeding an Eggplant to a bird in a Birdcage will produce 1–2 Eggplant Seeds, as well as a 50% chance to get a plain seed. In Don't Starve Together, you will always get 1 Eggplant Seed.

**Braised Eggplant** is a vegetable food item made by cooking an Eggplant on a fire (Campfire, Fire Pit, or a Dwarf Star). It restores much more health than its raw counterpart. It can also be used as an ingredient in several Crock Pot recipes. In most circumstances, it is far more efficient to cook the Eggplant, as a Braised Eggplant heals 12 more health and can regenerate spoilage time.

## Usage

- **Cooking**: transforms Eggplant into Braised Eggplant
- **Birdcage**: transforms Eggplant into Swirly Seeds
- **Manure**: transforms Eggplants into Manure

## Harvesting
Harvesting honey is a slow process with low risk. The **Beekeeper Hat** is designed to reduce damage from bees. The best source for honey is Bee Boxes; however, early in the game when these are not available yet, Bees and Beehives are a good alternative. Ideally, honey should be collected when all the bees are working outside.

### Bee Boxes
Bee Boxes contain 4 Bees. The first leaves immediately in the morning and one leaves every 37.5 seconds after. The best time to harvest then becomes about 4 hours into the day or right before dusk. Harvesting is perfectly safe any time during Winter, since the Bees will not come out of their boxes.

### Beehives
Destroying Beehives is trickier because it is harder to find an opportune time when all the Bees are out. With 6 Bees and one leaving every 50 seconds, the last worker will exit the hive 8.3 game hours (250 seconds) into the day, but dusk usually comes before this can happen. However, one or two Bees can be safely ignored for the short time it takes to smash the hive if one uses protective gear.

### Killer Bee Hives
Since Killer Bees do not leave their hive to collect nectar, there is no perfect time to attack a Killer Bee Hive. Getting close to a hive will cause all the Killer Bees to leave the hive and chase the player a short distance before retreating unless there is another Mob nearby.

## Usage
Honey can be used in Crock Pot recipes that require sweeteners, such as Taffy, Pumpkin Cookies, and Ice Cream. In addition, the following recipes specifically require Honey:

1. Honey Poultice
   - 2x Honey
   - 1x Papyrus
   - Tool: Alchemy Engine

2. Honey Nuggets

# Koalefant

## Overview
The **Koalefant** is a neutral animal in the game that can be found at the end of tracks left by **Suspicious Dirt Piles**. It drops 8 Meat and a Koalefant Trunk upon death, which can be used to craft a Breezy Vest. If killed with fire, it drops 8 Cooked Meat and Ashes. Alive, they periodically drop Manure, similar to Beefalo.

## Appearance and Behavior
- **Diet**: Veggie ![Veggie](Veggie.png)
- **Health**: 1000
- **Damage**: 50
- **Drops**: Meat ×8, Koalefant Trunk/Winter Koalefant Trunk, Periodic: Manure
- **Attack Period**: 4
- **Walk Speed**: 1.5
- **Run Speed**: 7

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Adorably delicious."
- Willow: "We will be great friends!"
- Wolfgang: "Nose meat!"
- Wendy: "A beast of solitude."
- WX-78: "POSSESSES AMPLE ENERGY RESERVES"
- Wickerbottom: "Koalefanta proboscidea."
- Woody: "He looks tasty."
- Maxwell: "A distant cousin of the beefalo."
- Wagstaff: "Ah ha! I have discovered the maker of all those tracks."
- Wigfrid: "Dear creature... I am going to eat you."
- Webber: "Maybe it's lost."
- Walani: "Hang ten, big guy."
- Warly: "Ah, you have fattened up nicely!"
- Woodlegs: "Woodlegs be knowin' yer fur be mighty warm."
- Wilba: 'TIS FAT AND TASTY
- Wormwood: "Bruamp! Bruamp!"
- Wheeler: "Mystery solved."
- Winona: "Hey! You look tasty!"
- Wortox: "A gentle beast with tiny horns."
- Wurt: "What big ears you have!"
- Walter: "The trail led us right to it."
- Wanda: "It's in the spring of its life."

## Winter Koalefant
During Winter, the Koalefant is replaced by the Winter Koalefant, which has a seasonally appropriate color change. It drops 8 Meat and a Winter Koalefant Trunk, which can be used to craft a Puffy Vest.

## Hunting
Koalefants can be discovered by investigating Suspicious Dirt Piles that randomly spawn nearby. Once examined, it is replaced by a footprint pointing to another pile approximately two screens away. The final footprint will lead to the Koalefant.

## Combat
Using a ranged weapon is the easiest way to initiate a fight, but the animal can also be cornered and struck with a melee weapon to engage. After being angered, the Koalefant will attempt to close distance with the attacker and strikes with the same timing as a Beefalo, although with more damage.

## Tips
- At night, the Koalefant will be sleeping, and although it will wake up and run away if approached, the time it takes to perform this action gives an opportunity for a melee strike.
- Cornering the Koalefant can be difficult with varying land tile layouts; it's more reliable to trap it along a precipice.
- Another killing method is to chase it into hostile Mobs such as mating Beefalos, Killer Bees, Tallbirds, etc.
- If one has an excess supply of Meat, the Koalefant can be guided to the base and kept for future use. As long as the Koalefant is alive, its Meat will never spoil.

## Trivia
- The name "Koalefant" is a portmanteau of "koala" and "elephant".
- According to Wickerbottom, its scientific name is Koalefanta proboscidea.
- A Koalefant can be chased into a pen to be kept as a pet. The Telelocator Staff and Telelocator Focus can also be used to achieve this.

# Frogs

## Overview

Frogs are hostile animals that spawn from green Ponds during the day and occasionally from Tumbleweeds when picked.

## Characteristics

- **Health:** 100
- **Damage:** 10
- **Drops:** [Frog Legs](#)
- **Attack Period:** 1
- **Attack Range:** 3
- **Walk Speed:** 4
- **Run Speed:** 8

## Quotes

- **Wilson:** "He's so cute!"
- **Willow:** "He's too damp to burn."
- **Wolfgang:** "Hey little froggy, froggy."
- **Wendy:** "He's little and warty."
- **WX-78:** "POTENTIAL BUNWICH."
- **Wickerbottom:** "A amphibian tetrapod."
- **Woodie:** "I don't trust anything that can't decide between air and water."
- **Maxwell:** "It jumps and licks things."
- **Wagmaff:** "A impressive criminal of the animal kingdom!"
- **Wigfrid:** "I'd like frög bööts sömeday."
- **Webber:** "Ack! Sticky tongue!"
- **Walani:** "Keep your tongue to yourself, bucko."
- **Warly:** "Frog. A delicacy."
- **Woodlegs:** "Dun hop near Woodlegs!"
- **Wilba:** "TIS A LITTLE FROGGY."
- **Wormwood:** "Ribbit"
- **Wheeler:** "Sir, you seem to have accidentally stolen my stuff!"
- **Winona:** "Yep! That's a frog."
- **Wortox:** "I hop, you hop. Friends til the end!"
- **Wurt:** "How you do?"
- **Walter:** "That doesn't look like the frogs in my handbook..."
- **Wanda:** "Don't even try it frogs, I'm one step ahead of you."

## Behavior

Frogs are normally slow-moving, but if the player (or any other mob) gets too close, they will become aggressive and begin to chase at a considerable speed. When a Frog is attacked while there are other Frogs in the vicinity, they will all turn hostile and attack.

## Combat

Frogs attack with their long tongues, dealing 10 damage. A successful hit by their tongue will knock off the player's first item out of the inventory and onto the ground. If there is a stack of the affected items, only one will be knocked out.

## Hunting

Frogs cannot be stunlocked and will continue attacking their enemy. This means that to kill a Frog without taking damage, the player must run in, attack, and run out again quickly while the Frog attacks, known as kiting.

## Frog Rain

In any Adventure Mode world with Rain, heavy rainfall can rain Frogs. This can be dangerous, since there is very little area to run once Frogs begin raining. It is easy to be killed by getting close to any of them and having them all become aggressive at once.

## Trivia

- Frogs will Sleep forever if a Pan Flute is used on them.
- Frogs can hit Krampus or other item-holding mobs and knock items out of their inventory.
- Frog Rain might be a reference to the biblical story of Moses, in which Egypt was plagued by millions of frogs.
- Frogs resemble real-life South American Horned Frogs in both appearance and aggression.

## Description

The Krampus Sack is a Backpack item. It is an extremely rare drop from Krampus, with only a 1% chance to drop from their small loot table. In Don't Starve Together, it has a 10% chance to drop from bundled supplies received from Klaus's Loot Stash.

A Krampus Sack has 14 inventory slots, 6 more than a Backpack and 2 more than a Piggyback. It cannot be placed in the player's inventory or in Chests, it doesn't sink in water, and it can't be lit on fire.

Even though the importance of only two extra slots may be minimal, the Krampus Sack doesn't slow the player down like the Piggyback does, making it a much better alternative. However, with a lowly 1% drop rate and a significant time investment to spawn a Krampus, it should be said that during any given game it's possible that the player might spend more time trying to get the item than would be saved by walking slower with the Piggyback. It may be better to ultimately treat the Krampus Sack as an unexpected bonus and/or something to only strive for in one's spare time. In some versions of the game, there are strategies to acquire a Krampus Sack quickly by using rollback/save features.

## Skins

- The Woven - Elegant Voidbag skin was introduced in the An Eye for An Eye update in 2021, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's Terraria. Its rarity was Inspired - Elegant initially, but received a change in August 19, 2022.

## Tips

- A quick way to spawn and farm Krampus is by killing a Glommer, so players should take advantage of every full moon cycle to retrieve the Glommer's Flower and kill the Glommer in an area where any spawned Krampus will quickly die. Neutral mobs will be aggressive towards Krampus, so a Pig or Bunnyman village would be an ideal location to kill a Glommer. Do take note if using this strategy that any Pigs or Bunnymen approached during a full moon will be aggressive towards the player. Tooth Traps work as well, but because Krampus might steal the traps instead of setting them off, it is a good idea to build traps around a chest, then put something common into that chest and spawn Krampus.

- This process can be sped up significantly in Don't Starve Together and Don't Starve: Pocket Edition by saving right before killing the Glommer and rollbacking/forcefully closing the server or app if none of the Krampii drop a sack. For the former, it must be noted that the player should load a rollback from the server menu rather than the in-game options, or else repeatedly loading a rollback can cause the game to always load the previous one.

# Living Staff

- **Damage**: 10
- **Equip Slot**: Hands
- **Perk**: Heals allies and puts enemies to sleep in spell circle. (Drops at the end of Round 3.)
- **Spawn Code**: "healingstaff"

## Exclusivity

Don't Starve Together

## Event

The Forge

The **Living Staff** is an item added to **The Forge** event in **Don't Starve Together**. Dropped from the last killed Pit Pig during the inferno on the third wave.

This item fires flower-like projectiles that deal 10 damage (like a punch) at the target. Like darts, these projectiles cannot miss their target.

## Staff of Life Special Ability - Life Blossom

When used, a small circle of green flowers appears in which all characters and allies can regenerate health. At the same time, all enemies that fall into the radius of action fall asleep until the end of flowering or until they are attacked.

## Tips

- Since lifebloom is pretty much the only way to boost players' health, the staff of life is the most important item in The Forge. You need to put a flower field as often as possible so that allies can restore more health. Crystal tiara and wood armor with silk will help with this, reducing the cooldown of the special ability.
- A player who uses a staff of life can be called a healer. Almost any character who knows how to handle staves can become it, however, only two have bonuses that somehow affect healing - Wickerbottom and Winona: Wickerbottom's enhanced spell restores health 20% faster, and 10% to the recharge speed of all items Winona allows you to put the flowering of life more often. Therefore, contrary to popular belief, Wilson is not the best healer.
- In a pinch, the staff can be picked up by Maxwell to summon a wave of shadow clones early on, attacking enemies from a distance.
- After the winding wreath drops, it is advisable for the team healer to change the crystal tiara to it, since this wreath adds 20% to outgoing healing. Experienced players may want to alternate headgear for greater effectiveness, however it is not clear when exactly the healing is calculated, during the casting of the spell or all the time.
- If someone in the team has died, it is recommended to place the bloom of life directly on the corpse: this will put enemy warriors to sleep trying to prevent the resurrection, as well as restore some health to the resurrected while the rise animation lasts.
- First of all, it is necessary to treat tanks and scorpionmen that have fallen into the acid (blooming completely removes the effect of the acid).
- During the boss fight, it's recommended to place a bloom right under the Boarrior's feet to make him fall asleep (all players must stop attacking), which will give the team time to heal. In its final fifth phase, the Boarrior begins to bypass the bloom, so players should use the cornering strategy: it's hard for the champion to get out of the corner without standing in the bloom.

# Resplendent Nox Helm

- **Perk**: +15% physical damage, -10% reload speed, +10% movement speed
- **Spawn Code**: `lavaarena_crowndamagerhat`
- **Exclusivity**: Don't Starve Together
- **Event**: The Forge

The Resplendent Nox Helm is an item added in The Forge event in Don't Starve Together. It drops in the middle of the tenth wave from a random enemy unit with a 50% chance; a flowering wreath may drop instead. If not dropped, it is guaranteed to drop from the Great Furnace Warrior Hog.

- **Usage**: It is put on the cell of the head. Increases physical damage by 15%, reduces ability recharge speed by 10%, and increases character's movement speed by 10%.

## Tips

- **Blooming Wreath**: This is a better option for a successful run, but if you get a Magnificent Helm of Might instead, don't despair. It is recommended that this helmet be worn by a player practicing darts (like Wilson or Wendy) to deal more damage to enemies and accumulate the special ability of darts more often. The speed bonus can help you dodge the Warrior Hog's fire lines after it hits the ground with its grappling hooks while moving around the boss.

## Resources

Birds can drop a variety of basic resources instead of seeds to help new players when they fly away. If the world is younger than 3 days, seeds will drop instead of other items. These common items are randomly chosen, and a given item won't drop if there is already a type of the same item within a radius of 2 tiles. Items will also not drop if 2 of the same type of items are within a radius of 5 tiles. The item depends on the age of the oldest player within a 5 tiles radius:

| Player Age | Birds Item |
|------------|------------|
| < 1 day    | Seeds (13%), Flint (3.5%), Twigs (2.3%), Cut Grass (1.2%) |
| 1 day      | Seeds (15%), Flint (2.5%), Twigs (1.7%), Cut Grass (0.8%) |
| 2 days     | Seeds (17%), Flint (1.5%), Twigs (1%), Cut Grass (0.5%)

**Wurt:** Somebody in there?
**Walter:** Woby, did you dig something up?
**Wanda:** There's something just irresistibly suspicious about it...

## Details
Suspicious Dirt Piles are naturally spawning objects. They can be found randomly in the world and will change locations if nearby players are more than 200 units away. Once examined, the Suspicious Dirt Pile will be uncovered by the Character and replaced by an Animal Track pointing towards the next Suspicious Dirt Pile in the hunt, which is spawned 40 units away from the current Suspicious Dirt Pile as soon as it is uncovered. Hunts can vary in length, from 6 to 12 Animal Tracks before the creature appears.

During the hunt, the final few Suspicious Dirt Piles may contain a Hound's Tooth, signaling the appearance of either a Ewecus or a Varg with equal chance. The chance for a dangerous hunt starts at 5% on Day 1 and increases gradually to 33% at Day 100.

| Custom Setting | Day 1 | Day 100+ |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Never         | 0%    | 0%       |
| Less          | 1.25% | 8.25%    |
| Default       | 5%    | 33%      |
| More          | 10%   | 66%      |
| Lots          | 70%   | 90%      |

Upon uncovering the final footprint, the character will alert the player that the creature is close. In non-dangerous hunts, if the current season is Winter the creature will always be a Winter Koalefant. If the creature appears in the Oasis Desert during the rain in Spring, it will always be a Volt Goat. Otherwise, the creature will be a regular Koalefant. The spawned creature will remain in the world until it is killed.

The track will disappear after 37.5 seconds, causing the player to fail the hunt. While it is raining or the ground is wet, the track will disappear after 22.5 seconds instead. After failing a hunt, there is a 5-second delay before a new set of tracks may spawn.

After completing a hunt, there is a 432-720 second cooldown until the next Suspicious Dirt Pile may spawn.

## Lunar Rift
While the Lunar Rift is active, every hunt will be guaranteed to be a dangerous hunt with a Varg at the end.

## Year of the Varg
During the Year of the Varg event in Don't Starve Together, if a trail of Suspicious Dirt Piles is investigated while an active Varg Shrine is in the world, it will always lead to the event-exclusive Set Piece consisting of a Clay Varg and twelve Clay Hounds.

## Trivia

- The Tam o' Shanter was added in the "A Winter's Tale" update.
- A Tam o' Shanter, often abbreviated T.O.S. or Tam, is a nineteenth-century Scottish traditional bonnet worn by men.
- Because of MacTusk's death animation, when the Shanter drops, the player will actually see two of them drop from the walrus. One is the item that the player can pick up, while the other is part of the animation and will disappear with MacTusk.
- As the Tam o' Shanter isn't craftable, the only way to use an alternate skin on one is with a Clean Sweeper.

# Crow

## Overview
Crows are birds that appear in any season and can land in most Turfs except Grass Turf. They fly down from off-screen and peck the ground for a few moments, then fly away. When they take flight, there is a chance that seeds are left behind, unless it's Winter. Crows will also be attracted to Seeds left on the ground. If the player or most other mobs get too close, birds will be frightened away. Birds won't land on Sticky Webbing and will swiftly fly away if they already lands.

## Usage
Crows can be hunted for their feathers, morsels, or jet feathers. They can be caught using a Bird Trap or killed with a Boomerang or other ranged weapons. When killed, crows drop a Morsel or a Jet Feather, and all other birds nearby will fly away. They are considered innocent creatures and killing them directly adds points to the player's naughtiness level, which causes Krampus to appear. Killing a Crow adds 1 point to the player's naughtiness level.

## Quotes
- Wilson: Creepy!
- Willow: I think it's waiting for me to die.
- Wolfgang: I do not like birds.
- Wendy: Take thy beak from out my heart!
- WX-78: IT IS SMARTER THAN MOST HUMANS
- Wickerbottom: Corvus brachyrhynchos.
- Woodie: He's planning something. I can tell.
- Maxwell: I don't know how they got here.

## Resources
Crows can drop a variety of basic resources instead of seeds to help new players when they fly away. If the world is younger than 3 days, seeds will drop instead of other items. These common items are randomly chosen, and a given item won't drop if there is already a type of the same item within a radius of 2 tiles. Items will also not drop if 2 of the same type of items are within a radius of 5 tiles. The item depends on the age of the oldest player within a 5 tiles radius:

| Player age | Birds Item |
|------------|------------|
| < 1 day    | Seeds (13%), Flint (3.5%), Twigs (2.3%), Cut Grass (1.2%) |
| 1 day      | Seeds (15%), Flint (2.5%), Twigs (1.7%), Cut Grass (0.8%) |
| 2 days     | Seeds (17%), Flint (1.5%), Twigs (1%), Cut Grass (0.5%) |
| ≤ 20 days  | Seeds (20%) |
| ≤ 1 year   | Seeds (16%) |
| > 1 year   | Seeds (12%) |

The actual value is the duration of Autumn, which is 20 days in the default settings.

## Hunting
Crows can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one. They can be Murdered by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Jet Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel. Birds in the player's inventory can be dropped on the ground and will flop on the ground belly-up for a short while before flying off. They can also be imprisoned in Bird Cages.

Hunting Birds requires a ranged weapon such as a Boomerang. Birds will not land within melee range (even if bait is placed on the ground) and will fly away when the player approaches. However, if they are put to sleep when using characters with a normal damage modifier, they can be killed in 1 hit with a sufficient melee weapon.

If a bird is in flight while in range of a sleeping item's effect, it will plummet to the ground and can be picked up as an item.

Wearing a Feather Hat will increase the number of Birds spawning as well as decreasing the time between spawns. Using Birds of the World (while playing as Wickerbottom) will also cause a large number of them to land.

One can send a Smallbird to attack a Bird. This can be done without the bird getting frightened and without raising naughtiness.

They take one blast from the Ice Staff to be frozen and one Sleep Dart to be put to sleep.

## Tips
- When bait-trapping Birds for their Feathers, players should make sure to do so on Turf in which specific Birds will spawn, so that they get specific Feathers. Redbirds and Snowbirds spawn most commonly on Grass Turf, while Crows spawn on Rocky Turf and all player-made turfs.
- If one can manage to bring a Damaged Bishop from the Ruins, their ranged

- **Willow**: A whole city of my own to burn down!
- **Wolfgang**: Wolfgang have his own city now!
- **Wendy**: I'll build a necropolis. 
- **WX-78**: I CONTROL THE MAINFRAME!!
- **Wickerbottom**: The ideal city would be full of libraries.
- **Woodie**: Need lots of trees in our city.
- **Maxwell**: Building a city is a step down for me.
- **Wagstaff**: The gift of urban planning in the palm of my hand!

- **Wilba**: MY KINGDOM FOR A TOWN!
- **Wormwood**: For Twirly Tail Town
- **Wheeler**: Swell. Now I can be responsible for a whole city.
- **Choose**: Wilba

The **Key to the City** is an **Item** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It can be acquired by opening the respective **Royal Gallery Exhibit** with a **Royal Gallery Key** in the **Pig Queen** **Palace**. The Key to the City serves as a portable crafting station, unlocking the **City Planning Tab** when being held in the **inventory** or standing next to it. The **City Planning Tab** is not accessible when one is in **Interiors**. **Town Houses** crafted with the Key to the City will give 1 **Oinc** every 10 days if **My City Hall** is built.

If taken to other worlds (either **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** forest or **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** tropical islands), it is possible to make a pig city in these selective worlds.

### Prototype Tips
- It is possible to farm trinkets by making **The Sty Oddities Emporium** or the **The Flying Pig Arcane Shop**, buying the trinkets, and then destroying them with the **Executive Hammer**. As long as one has lots of pig skin, farming trinkets should be a breeze.

### Mosquito Bugs
- The Key to the City will not work if being held in a backpack or any other kind of added storage.

# Reed Tunic

![Reed Tunic](Reed Tunic.png)

- **Perk**: Reduces the cooldown speed of all abilities by 5%.
- **Spawn Code**: `lavaarena_armorlight`

The Reed Tunic is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together. It is available immediately from Maxwell and Wickerbottom.

### Details

- **Armor Type**: Body cell
- **Damage Reduction**: 50%

### Tips

- **Damage Absorption**: This armor is the worst in terms of damage absorption. Armor wearers should avoid melee combat, and melee characters (Wolfgang, WX-78) should not equip armor in favor of better damage protection.
- **Ability Cooldown**: The 5% ability cooldown speed can slightly help Wickerbottom and Maxwell turn enemies to stone or plant lifeblooms more often until Wood Armor with Silk drops. Other characters can pick it up to flurry more often, at the expense of mobility.

# Beehives
Beehives are naturally occurring structures only found in Grassland Biomes, holding up to 6 Bees or Killer Bees. They have 200 health, and drop 1 Honeycomb and 3 Honey when destroyed. Unlike Bee Boxes, Bees have no effect on the items dropped. Beehives do not respawn.

Attacking a Beehive will anger nearby Bees, and spawn Killer Bees from the nest itself. Even though Honeycomb and Honey are not flammable, burning a Beehive will yield 4 Ashes. Beehives can be repaired with healing items.

# Killer Bee Hive
Killer Bee Hives are naturally occurring structures found only in Grasslands biomes (usually next to Beehives) holding up to 6 Killer Bees. They appear in Survival Mode and more frequently in Adventure mode. Like normal Beehives, Killer Bee Hives drop 1 Honeycomb and 3 Honey. They also do not respawn.

# Spawning Mechanics
A Beehive will (re)spawn a new Bee every game hour (30 seconds) up to the maximum population of 6 Bees per hive. Bees will leave their hive during the daytime, one at a time every 50 seconds. They return to their hive at dusk. During Winter, Bees do not leave their hive.

A Killer Bee Hive will (re)spawn a new Bee every 20 seconds up to the maximum population of 6 per hive. Killer Bees normally stay inside their hive all day. If the player wanders too close to their home they will immediately swarm out and attack even at Night and during Winter. Other creatures do not trigger this behavior.

If a Bee or a Killer Bee is attacked or captured with a Bug Net, all members of the hive will emerge as Killer Bees to engage the offender. Additionally, Bees from the same hive, that are less than a screen away, and any "homeless" bees (killer or otherwise) will also join the fight. Up to 10 Bees and Killer Bees will engage the offender, however additional offences, such as attacking one of the defenders is considered a new offence and additional Bees may join the fight.

If a hive is attacked, all Bees inside the hive will emerge as Killer Bees to attack the offender. Bees that were already outside (before the hive was attacked) will ignore the threat to the hive itself, but not the threat to the Killer Bees defending the hive; They will join the

## Description
Buzzards are neutral mobs found in the Desert and Rockyland biomes. They circle the skies in search of Meats, appearing as shadows on the ground. When a circling Buzzard spots meat, it will land and begin to eat it. Once done eating all Meats, Seeds, Rot, Glommer's Goop, or unharvested Mandrakes in its vicinity, it will take off again. If the player approaches a Buzzard while it is eating, it will squawk in anger and peck at the player, causing damage. The Buzzard will not, however, pursue the player. When killed, 1 Buzzard drops 1 Drumstick, 1-2 Morsels, and possibly 1 Jet Feather.

## Hunting
### Attracting
When a piece of meat is placed in the vicinity of a Buzzard shadow, it is possible one might fly down next to the meat. If the Buzzard is far away from it, it will hop slowly towards the meat. Buzzards that are approached preemptively will fly away. When attacked before squawking in anger, Buzzards will either fly away or fight back.

### Attacking
It is recommended to melee the Buzzard only once to get its peck on cooldown unless the player is positioned just right to hit the Buzzard an additional two times while it is landing. After it has landed one can then kite it with two hits in between pecks. Boomerangs and other ranged weapons are a safe bet as the Buzzards will not flee when attacked while eating.

## Trivia
- "Buzzard" can either refer to a number of broad-winged hawks or, usually in North America, a New World vulture, typically a turkey vulture. Since Klei is located in Canada, Buzzards of Don't Starve are based on the latter, and they appear to be and behave like vultures rather than hawks.
- Wickerbottom refers to it as Cathartes, which is a genus of New World vultures which includes the turkey vulture (aka buzzard), the lesser yellow-headed vulture, and the greater yellow-headed vulture.
- Real buzzards hiss instead of squawk since they lack vocal chords.

## Behavior

Ghosts are aggressive mobs that can appear with a 10% chance when digging up a Grave with the Shovel or Regal Shovel, or when all the graves are dug in Maxwell's Graveyard. They make unique whispering noises when attacked or defeated. They do not attack like regular mobs, instead inflicting damage whenever next to the player or mob. This damage comes in the form of small attacks that are dealt very quickly over time. Ghosts don't drop anything upon "death".

Every Grave in the world will spawn a ghost during a Full Moon. These ghosts despawn when nighttime ends, this counts as a death for the purposes of summoning Abigail.

In Don't Starve Together, Ghosts are neutral towards Wendy.

## Strategy

| Weapon | Number of Hits |
|--------|---------------|
| Immune | Immune        |
| Fire Dart, Fire Staff | 48   |
| Fishing Rod, Bug Net | 15   |
| Lucy the Axe | 12   |
| Shovel, Pitchfork, Hammer, Torch, Umbrella, Walking Cane, Willow's Lighter | 8   |
| Axe, Pickaxe, Luxury Axe, Opulent Pickaxe | 7   |
| Boomerang | 6   |
| 4-7 | 5   |
| 3 or 5 | 4   |
| 4 | 3   |
| 3 | 2   |
| 1 | 1   |

## Tips

- Because Ghosts will disappear after a while and do not drop anything, it is best to just let them be. The easiest way to kill a Ghost is by luring it to a few Pigs or a Beefalo; this way the Pigs or Beefalo will kill the Ghost.
- A Ghost can also be used as a grinder; let it kill whatever enemy it comes across, then take the drops.
- Ghosts are very slow and can be easily outrun. After the player has run a distance, the pursuing Ghost will likely have found another mob to be aggressive against.
- Despite levitating above the ground, Ghosts are not immune to Tooth Traps.

## Trivia

- In Don't Starve Together, Ghosts cannot be revived with a Telltale Heart, and attempting to do so will result in a unique quote from the player character.

## Bugs

- Ghosts try to kill planted Mandrakes, despite them being invulnerable while planted; this causes them to simply hover above it.
- In Don't Starve, it's possible for a Ghost to damage the player even after being killed.

- **Source**: When examining a Clockwork Bishop

## Behavior
When any creature gets near its sight range, the Bishop will suddenly wake up and stare at them as a warning. Getting closer will make the Bishop attack by firing lightning bolts from its head. The Bishop will chase its enemy a short distance from its spawn area before returning and going back to sleep.

## Hunting Tips
The Bishop is overall the most difficult of the Chess Pieces, it is a strong ranged mob, and very accurate, making it almost impossible to kite effectively so it is recommended to be armored. Another way to kill a Bishop would be to aggravate a nearby Clockwork Rook without waking the Bishop and get the Rook to ram the Bishop. It is possible to dodge the Bishop's lighting bolts if the player is quick enough.

## Tips
- Clockwork Bishops (as well as knights and rooks) can be lit on fire with a [[Torch]]. If on fire, bishops and knights jump around until the flame extinguishes without attacking.

## Trivia
- The Clockwork Bishop was originally added in the [[Don't Starve/Version History#Doorway to Adventure|Doorway to Adventure]] update.
- According to quotes, the bishop is Maxwell's favorite clockwork.

- **Winona**: Toolbox controls.
- **Wortox**: My, my, what do you see?
- **Wurt**: Neat!
- **Walter**: No chewing on this bone, okay Woby?
- **Wanda**: Do you ever blink?

## Description
The **Eye Bone** is an item that spawns **Chester** in **Don't Starve**. It is a naturally spawned item that can be found anywhere on the map, typically lying on the ground near a cobblestone road. To obtain the Eye Bone early, one must find a cobblestone road and follow it to a **Grasslands** biome surrounded by **Beehives** and **Ponds**. Note: there are cases where it is not found in the Grasslands biome. In this case, it will spawn randomly near the player in a **Marsh** biome.

Once spawned, **Chester** will continue to follow the player as long as the Eye Bone is in their inventory. The Eye Bone can be dropped on the ground or placed inside Chester to make him stop following the player.

At night or in the **Ruins**, Chester will sleep until enough distance separates him and the Eye Bone. If Chester is killed, he will drop all stored items, and the Eye Bone will no longer open its eye (it remains closed). The eyelid will reopen after Chester respawns in one day.

**Splumonkeys** will not steal the Eye Bone, and **Eyeplants** will not eat it. **Krampus** can only steal the Eye Bone if it's in a **Backpack**. The Eye Bone cannot be teleported with the player via **Wooden Thing** (it will turn to **Ashes** upon arrival to the next world).

As long as **Webber** is the one carrying the Eye Bone, spiders will not attack Chester. This does not apply to the **Spider Queen**, or the spiders spawned by her.

## Skins
| Narwalrus Eye Bone | Woolly Eye Bone | Twisted Eye Bone |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Eye Bone bound with Narwalrus Chester | Eye Bone bound with Woolly Chester | It looks like it has a bone to pick with you. |

## Trivia
- Chester and the Eye Bone were added in the **Spoiled Rotten** update.
- The eye on the bone might belong to Chester. This could explain why it closes when Chester dies and the reason for him to follow the player.
- An Eye Bone spawned via Console will only spawn Chester one time.
- It is possible to get multiple functioning Chesters with the console, first by spawning a Chester without the Eye Bone (he will run away instead of following if the player gets close), then using the console to get another Eye Bone. This will cause the skittish Chester to connect to that particular Eye Bone and begin following it as normal.
- In DST, Eye Bone will sink in the water, however, it will return to the coast.

# MacTusk n' Son
![MacTusk N' Son](MacTuskNSon.jpg)
MacTusk n' Son is a Walrus Hunting Party consisting of MacTusk, Wee MacTusk, and two Blue Hounds. They spawn from Walrus Camps in Winter.

## Command structure
| Walrus Camp | MacTusk | Wee MacTusk | Blue Hound | Blue Hound |
|-------------|---------|------------|------------|------------|
| ![Walrus Camp](Navbox Walrus Camp.png) | ![MacTusk](Navbox MacTusk.png) | ![Wee MacTusk](Navbox_WeeTusk.png) | ![Blue Hound](Navbox Blue Hound.png) | ![Blue Hound](Navbox Blue Hound.png) |

## Behavior
They're only active during daytime and, if not engaged, will return to their igloo at dusk. However, they can be forced out by attacking the sleeping Hounds. Although the Walrus Camp emits light at dark, the Hounds will attack anyone close by. The group, being hostile towards almost any Mob, follows a nearby target; if one keeps walking away, they will not attack. When the leader, MacTusk, becomes hostile, he makes a slashing gesture, he then shoots and pursues the target, while Wee MacTusk commands the Hounds to attack. Both walruses will flee when approached. Should MacTusk and Wee MacTusk die, the Hounds will attack freely until they respawn. If the Hounds are killed but MacTusk survives, he will come out the next day. Dead members respawn in 2.5 days.

## Tips
- MacTusk can be chased towards his igloo to block his path; he can then be stun-locked and taken out with a melee weapon.
- In the Reign of Giants DLC, dispatching two Blue Hounds in quick succession (like with the Chester method above) will freeze the attacker, this can be avoided by waiting out the pale hue before killing the second one.
- MacTusk can be stun-locked while doing the battle cry animation.
- One can use a combo of Ice Staff and a weapon on MacTusk.
- Should one come across a dormant Walrus Camp, it would be prudent to set up defenses, such as Tooth Traps.
- It is possible to construct a MacTusk drop farm using at least 4 Pig Houses. Stone Walls can be used to keep them closer to each other, allowing easy access to the non-food drops. It also makes basing near the Walrus Camp more beneficial.

## Trivia
- MacTusk N' Son was introduced in the A Winter's Tale update.
- MacTusk deals 33 damage with his Blow Dart, whereas the player deals 100 damage with the same weapon. This is because MacTusk uses an identical weapon in the code with 0 damage, which takes his damage output. Without it, he would hurt the player instantly.
- Wolfgang refers to MacTusk as "Sea Cow man!". Sea Cow is a marine mammal unrelated to the Walrus.
- As seen by his quotes, Maxwell knows MacTusk and perhaps created him.
- Both walruses share the same hunchback model as Pigs, Merms, and Bunnymen.
- In the trailer for A Winter's Tale, Wee MacTusk also attacks the player.

## Bugs
- MacTusk will become passive and return to his camp if chased outside of his wandering range, ignoring enemies.
- In Don't Starve, WeeTusk won't drop Meat when killed because the wrong set of brackets is used in his loot table.
- If the Walrus Camp is close to the shore, MacTusk may respawn and walk on the ocean, unable to get back on land. This bug also occurs to other mobs (such as Pigs and Wildbore) if their housing structure is too close to the ocean.
- When the season changes, the group may be locked out of their camp, and therefore, be active outside of Winter.

## Behavior

MacTusk is an aggressive mob that spawns from Walrus Camps during Winter. They are only active during daytime and, if not engaged, will return to their igloo at dusk. They can be forced out by attacking the sleeping Hounds. Although the Walrus Camp emits light at dark, the Hounds will attack anyone close by.

The group, being hostile towards almost any mob, follows a nearby target; if one keeps walking away, they will not attack. When the leader, MacTusk, becomes hostile, he makes a slashing gesture, he then shoots and pursues the target, while Wee MacTusk commands the Hounds to attack. Both walruses will flee when approached.

Should MacTusk and Wee MacTusk die, the Hounds will attack freely until they respawn. If the Hounds are killed but MacTusk survives, he will come out the next day. Dead members respawn in 2.5 days.

## Hunting

A simple way to distract the party is to use Chester as bait, by placing him between MacTusk and the player. This makes it much easier to kill both Hounds.

Recruiting Pigs or even a single Pig is another option. With the Hounds engaged, one can hunt down MacTusk personally.

An Ice Staff or Sleep Dart is more effective with a strong melee weapon; alternatively, MacTusk can be killed with 3 Blow Darts. As he always drops a Blow Dart, this would only cost a net of 2 Dart(s).

The party can also be chased or led into other Mobs (e.g. Merms, Pengulls, Tentacles etc.), or into Tooth Traps.

## Tips

- MacTusk can be chased towards his igloo to block his path; he can then be stun-locked and taken out with a melee weapon.
- MacTusk can be stun-locked while doing the battle cry animation.
- One can use a combo of Ice Staff and a weapon on MacTusk.

# Pith Pike

- **Perk**: User rushes forward, dealing 30 damage to anything in its path. (Pyre Poker attack flips Snortoises, disabling them for some time or until they're attacked.)
- **Equip Slot**: Hands
- **Spawn Code**: `spear_gungnir`
- **Damage**: 25
- **Exclusive to**: Don't Starve Together
- **Event**: The Forge

## Description

The **Pith Pike** is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together. Available immediately from Wigfrid when playing as her. This item is a melee weapon. When attacking, the character swings his pike and deals 25 damage to the target.

The main ability of the powerful pike is a fiery dash (**Pyre Poker**). When used, a character makes a dash forward, causing damage to all enemies in the path of the dash. This ability is capable of flipping over Snortoises, rendering them unable to attack or move for long periods of time.

## Tips

- This weapon is the most powerful starting weapon of all. In the initial stages of the battle with the army of the Warlord, you can increase the damage of the pike even more by wearing a spiked helmet and/or sharp-toothed wood armor.
- Unlike the hammer of the Crucible, the powerful pike does not penetrate the armor of enemy warriors. It is recommended to focus the attack on the creature that the player with the hammer is attacking in order to deal more damage.
- If the team does not have a character with a tome of petrification, on wave 7 you can turn over a small group of grunts so that they do not interfere with the team dealing with the rest.

# Slurper

![Slurper Image](File:Slurper.png)

The Slurper is a creature found only in the Ruins, in Wilds, Village and rarely in the Mushtree Forest biome. It attacks by rolling to and biting the target and then jumping up and engulfing the player's head with its mouth. It is a veggie diet creature.

### Attributes

- **Health**: 200
- **Damage**: 30
- **Attack Period**: 5
- **Attack Range**: 8
- **Walk Speed**: 9
- **Special Ability**: Provides light while awake.
- **Drops**: 
  - [[File:Light Bulb.png|24px|link=Light_Bulb]] ×2
  - [[File:Slurper Pelt.png|24px|link=Slurper Pelt]] 50%

### Abilities and Mechanics

- **Spawn Code**: "slurper"
- **Sanity Bonus**: -25/min
- **Hunger Bonus**: -100/min
- **Durability**: Unlimited
- **Perk**: Emits light.
- **Stack**: Cannot stay in inventory

When equipped as a head item, it drains Hunger at a rate of 1.7 per second or 5 every 3 seconds (about ten times faster than normal hunger drain). It gives off light with a radius similar to a Miner Hat when attached to a head.
A Slurper may attach itself to the head of a Bunnyman or Pig. Slurpers can be removed by attempting to unequip them from the head slot with the mouse. They always drop two Light Bulbs when killed and sometimes also a Slurper Pelt.

### Quotes

- Wolfgang: "No! No! Stay off head!"
- Wilson: "It's so hairy!"
- Willow: "Do they have little fires in their bellies?"
- Woodie: "I think it's living hair."
- Maxwell: "Simple creatures. They exist only to sleep and feed."
- Wickerbottom: "A classic example of symbiosis."

### Tips

- Slurpers can be brought to the surface while attached to a player's head. They cannot break walls, and therefore can easily be kept as pets that provide an almost infinite light source.
- An equipped Slurper will not prevent the player from eating, or reading if playing as Wickerbottom or Maxwell, or shaving their beard if playing as Webber or Wilson.

### Trivia

- Slurpers were added in the 'Hungry For Your Hunger' update and are the reason why this update was dubbed so.
- Slurpers may be a reference to Facehuggers from the Alien franchise, which attach to their victim's face and eventually lead to their death.

# Mosquito

## Overview
![Mosquito](Mosquito_Build.png)  
The Mosquito is a hostile [Mob] that spawns from [Ponds], at [Dusk] and Night, in [Marsh] [Biomes]. Mosquitoes are fast-moving and aggressive.

## Attributes
- **Health**: 100
- **Damage**: 3 (by hit) / 34 (by explosion)
- **Spoil**: 2 days
- **Tool**: Can be [Catched] with [Net Tools](Bug Net)
- **Drops**: [Mosquito Sack] 50%
- **Attack Period**: 2
- **Attack Range**: 4
- **Walk Speed**: 8
- **Run Speed**: 12
- **Special Ability**: Explodes after sucking enough blood.
- **Spawns From**: [Pond]
- **Dropped By**: [Tumbleweed] (0.1%)
- **Stack**: 20
- **Spawn Code**: `mosquito`

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: Disgusting little bloodsucker.

## Hunting
The most effective way to deal with Mosquitoes is to capture them with a [Bug Net]. When caught, the Mosquito will turn into an [Item] in the player's [Inventory], which can be Murdered for a 50% chance of getting a Mosquito Sack. Due to their fast flying speed, Mosquitoes are difficult to hit with melee [weapons]. When hit, the Mosquito will be "stunlocked" and spin around for a moment before recovering. This makes them very easy to kill in a 1v1 fight.

| Weapon | No. of hits for [Mosquito] |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Fishing Rod | Bug Net | 24 |
| Lucy the Axe | 6 |
| Shovel | Pitchfork | 4 |
| Hammer | Torch | Umbrella | 3 |
| Walking Cane | Willow's Lighter | 2-4 |
| Axe | Pickaxe | 2 or 3 |
| Luxury Axe | Opulent Pickaxe | 2 |
| Boomerang | PickSlashAxe | 1 |
| Spear | Bat Bat | Fire Dart | Fire Staff | 1 |

Mosquitoes take one blast from the [Ice Staff] to be frozen and one [Sleep Dart] to be put to sleep.

## Usage

- **Tool**: Hand
- **Result**: Mosquito Sack

### Recipe 2

# Varg
The Varg, also known as the Warg, is an aggressive Mob in the Reign of Giants DLC. When tracking Suspicious Dirt Piles, there is a chance for a Varg to be found instead of a Koalefant or a Ewecus. This chance starts at 2.5% on Day one, and gradually increases to 16.5% chance on Day 100. When killed, the Varg drops around 4-6 Monster Meat and 1-3 Hound's Tooth.

## Characteristics
- Health: 1800
- Damage: 50
- Attack Period: 3
- Attack Range: 5
- Run Speed: 5.5
- Drops: Hound's Tooth ×1-3, Monster Meat ×4-6
- Spawns: Hound, Red Hound, Blue Hound
- Spawn Code: warg
- Spawns From: Suspicious Dirt Pile

## Quotes
- Wilson: You might be something to reckon with, big dog.
- Willow: You're a big mean jerk!
- Wolfgang: Big puppy!
- Wendy: A true bastion of evil.
- WX-78: IT LIVES TO EAT LARGE THINGS

## Attack Pattern
The Varg will howl, calling forth two Hounds to the battle. Vargs are able to summon both normal and special Hounds (based on the season), which is decided at random. A single Varg can summon up to five hounds and will not summon any more until they are killed, no matter how far apart the Hounds are from their Varg.

At close range, it attacks by biting, with a two-hit delay. It moves slowly, but attacks quickly and has a large range for its jaws.

## Usage
The Varg can effectively be used as a way to spawn Hounds if there are no nearby Hound Mounds (or all the Hound Mounds in the current world are destroyed).

## Tips
- A Varg has a limit of 6-8 Hound followers, after which it will stop summoning them. If any of its spawn dies, or moves too far away from the Varg, it will attempt to summon more.
- Sleeping Vargs may be woken up by the barking of any nearby Hounds. They may also awaken if the player stands too close to them for too long, similar to Beefalo in heat.
- The Varg will always howl to summon Hounds when it can do so. It is even able to do so for a brief moment after it has died after its death animation.

## Trivia
- The Warg is a wolf-like creature from Norse mythology. The term was used to refer to Fenrir and his offspring.
- J. R. R. Tolkien popularized Wargs in his fantasy novels set in Middle Earth, like The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. They are also popular in Dungeons & Dragons, where they are known as "Worgs" or "Dire Wolves".
- If a Varg is spawned in the Caves or Ruins, it will summon Depths Worms instead of Hounds.
- Out of all the creatures that drop Monster Meat, a Varg can drop the second highest number, with a maximum of six, beaten only by the Pugalisk, which can drop up to 16.
- Vargs were added to Don't Starve Together before the rest of the Reign of Giants DLC in the Stuck in the Middle with Ewe update.
- Vargs were featured during the Year of the Varg event for Don't Starve Together in early 2018.
