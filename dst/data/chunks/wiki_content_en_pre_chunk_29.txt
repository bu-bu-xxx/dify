# Marble Suit

## Overview
The Marble Suit is a type of wearable armor crafted in the Fight Tab. 

## Crafting
- **Tier:** 2
- **Ingredients:**
  - Marble: 6 (multiplier)
  - Rope: 2 (multiplier)
- **Perk:** Reduces speed by 30%.
- **Durability:** 1050 hp
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** "armormarble"
- **Dropped By:** Ancient Pseudoscience Station (Hammer), Slotmachine Shipwrecked icon

## Description
It's heavy, but it will protect you. Offers 95% protection.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "This looks really heavy."
- Willow: "If I have to fight I might as well be protected."
- Wolfgang: "I tie rocks to muscles."
- ... (quotes from other characters)

## Tips
- Due to the armor's speed penalty, it is better suited for tanking damage rather than kiting an opponent.
- High protection makes it a good tanking armor on characters with low max health.
- Not practical to wear all the time; can switch to it when tanking in combat or use Walking Cane to negate most speed penalty.
- In Don't Starve Together, wearing armor that takes up the head slot with Marble Suit can effectively increase durability.

## Trivia
- The Marble Suit was added in the 'The End Is Nigh' update.
- Renewable since Marble can be obtained from Earthquakes in Caves and mined from Marble Shrubs grown from Marble Beans in Don't Starve Together.
- A character wearing a Marble Suit makes a small clanking noise when walking.

# Bed Rolls

Bed Rolls are craftable **items** that can be used to sleep through the **night**. There are two types of bed rolls: **Straw Rolls** and **Fur Rolls**.

## Usage Restrictions

Players cannot use Bed Roll in several circumstances: when it's daytime, they are below 25 **hunger**, hound attack is coming, or they are near a monster. Bed rolls cannot be used in "dangerous" situations, such as near a **Spider Nest**, in a **Marsh** (if **Tentacles** are nearby, as any Tentacles count as dangerous mobs even if they're under the surface), during combat, when **monsters** are nearby, and when **Hounds** or **Depths Worms** are approaching. This also includes **Shadow Creatures**.

If **Hunger** reaches 0, the character will automatically wake up to avoid starvation.

Bed Rolls are unusable by **Wickerbottom** due to her insomnia. Bed Rolls are useful for **Wormwood** as he cannot restore health from food.

The **Straw Roll** is a one-time use **Healing Filter** item that characters can use to sleep at dusk and night. While sleeping, every second the player drains 1 **hunger** to restore 0.5 **HP** and 0.67 **Sanity**. It is safe to sleep in complete darkness but the player can still be attacked by hounds or spiders. Any attack will interrupt sleep animation.

The **Fur Roll** is a **Healing Filter** item that can be used to sleep through Dusk and Night, restoring Sanity and Health. It requires 1 **Straw Roll**, 2 **Bunny Puffs** to make, and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.

The Fur Roll can be used three times. While sleeping, every second the player drains 1 **hunger** to restore 1 **HP** and 1 **Sanity**. It is safe to sleep in complete darkness but the player can still be attacked by hounds or spiders. Any attack will interrupt sleep animation.

Additionally, sleeping in a Fur Roll will increase the user's temperature by 1/second if it is less than 40, and decrease the user's temperature by 1/second if it is greater than 40.

The Fur Roll will not prevent the user's temperature from being affected by other sources, so its temperature effect may be counteracted, and will also stack with other sources.

## Description
Coffee Plants are plants introduced in the *Don't Starve: Shipwrecked* DLC. They can be found only inside *Volcano*, but can be dug with a *Shovel* to be moved outside. They can be harvested to receive 1 *Coffee Beans* after which they will need 4 to 5 *Days* to regrow. *Rain* does not reduce this time.

### Planting Conditions
Coffee Plants can only be planted on either *Magma Turf* which can be found outside the volcano or on *Ashy Turf* and *Volcano Turf* which have to be dug up inside the volcano using a *Pitchfork* and brought outside.

### Harvesting and Growth
Coffee Plants will produce *Coffee Beans* for 3-5 harvests during *Dry* season (*Summer* if replanted in *Don't Starve: Reign of Giants*), after which they will require additional *Fertilizer*. As the plant gets closer to this point, it will begin to show fewer and fewer fruit at the tips of its leaves. When it can no longer be harvested, it will again resemble a withered Coffee Plant.

### Temperature Sensitivity
Coffee plants only thrive in hot temperatures, and as a result will wither outside of Dry/Summer seasons. The plant is only protected from withering for 1 harvest after being fertilized, this means that picking coffee outside of warm seasons will only yield 1 harvest instead of 3-5 before requiring fertilizer again. If replanted in *RoG* then coffee beans will not grow at all during *Winter*.

### Fertilization
Unlike other plants like berry bushes or grass tufts, players must fertilize Coffee Plants with *Ashes* if in its withered form. Once it has stopped bearing fruit it will need 4 to 5 *Ashes* to be fertilized again. *Manure* or *Rot* cannot be used to fertilize Coffee Plants.

## Special Properties
Coffee Plants are not flammable in that they cannot be set on *Fire* by the player or wildfires. When they are dug and held as an item in the player's inventory, they can however be used as fuel in *Campfires*, *Chiminea* and so on.

Coffee Plants are also safe from other destructive forces of nature like *Lightning* and when fertilized, and they can even withstand *Dragoon Egg*s which fall from the sky during a Volcano eruption. The impact of a Dragoon Egg will merely uproot the plant without lighting the plant on fire.

## Downloadable Content
In the *Don't Starve: Hamlet* (HAM) DLC, the Particulate Purifier will grant immunity to the toxic gas in the Gas Rainforest, as well as the Noxious Cloud created by using the Bug B'Gone. It also grants protection against the effects of Hay Fever.

## Tips
- **WX-78** is immune to poison, therefore wearing a Particulate Purifier gives no benefits outside of Hamlet.
- The Particulate Purifier renders the Stink Rays completely harmless, making Stink Ray spawns a very good source of Monster Meat and Venom Glands.

## Trivia
- Prior to the "Seas The Day!" update, this item was simply called "The Gas Mask", which functioned identically, except for a slightly different recipe and texture. Its description was "Why smell bad smells?", and it cost 2 Empty Bottles, 1 Cloth, and 1 Jellyfish.
  - The Gas Mask also had a voice filter which would increase the pitch of a character's voice when saying something.
  - The concept of the Gas Mask is reused in HAM, bearing a large visual resemblance as well as sharing the same name.

## Quotes for Cooked Frog Legs

- Wolfgang: Is mostly taste like chicken.
- ... (other quotes)

## Usage

- **Cooking:** Recipe to make Cooked Frog Legs
- **Drying:** Recipe to make Small Jerky
- **Bird Interaction:** Recipe to get Egg
- **Crock Pot:** Recipe to make Froggle Bunwich

## Tips

- Frog Legs could be a good meat resource for Wigfrid early game, due to her ability to knock out Frogs in 2 hits with her Battle Spear, and she can recover even if she gets hit, since she starts with a Battle Helm and gains health as she kills opponents.

## Trivia

- Despite being a meat item, Frog Legs cannot be traded to the Pig King for Gold Nuggets. Eggs gotten from a Birdcage can be traded, making it possible to indirectly obtain Gold Nuggets with Frog Legs.
- In Don't Starve Together, if Wilson is equipped with his full Survivor Skin, his portrait will show him eating Cooked Frog Legs.
- Multiple characters state that this item is still twitchy or still jumps. In real life, frog legs are known to do just that, especially when salt is added.
- Humorously, the gigantic boss Toadstool drops a pair of Frog Legs the same size as those of a Frog or Merm, despite it being much bigger than either of them.

# Dragon Fruit

**Dragon Fruit** is a rare type of fruit that has a 5% chance to be grown from farm plots by planting seeds (or 4.75% in **Reign of Giants** or 3.7% in **Shipwrecked**). Dragon Fruits can also be produced by feeding a caged bird a Dragon Fruit to receive 1-2 Dragon Fruit Seeds and a 50% chance to get a generic seed.

## Characteristics

- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Dropped By**: ![Slot Machine](Slotmachine.png)
- **Icon**: ![Dragon Fruit](Dragon%20Fruit.png)
- **Image**: ![Dragon Fruit Dropped](Dragon%20Fruit%20Dropped.png)
- **Food Value**: Fruit × 1
- **HP Restored**: 3
- **Hunger Restored**: 9.375
- **Sanity Restored**: 0
- **Spoil**: 6 Days
- **Stack**: 40
- **Spawn Code**: "dragonfruit"

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: What a weird fruit.
- **Wendy**: This isn't shaped like a dragon at all.
- **Walter**: Looks tasty.
- **Wickerbottom**: Hylocereus undatus, or Pitahaya blanca.

## Preparation

Dragon Fruit, along with 3 twigs, is recommended to be cooked into **Dragonpie** because Dragonpie restores a lot more hunger and health. Furthermore, Dragonpie is fresh longer than the time it takes Dragon Fruit to rot; Dragon Fruit should be cooked into Dragonpie the earliest possible.

## Prepared Dragon Fruit

Prepared Dragon Fruit is made by cooking Dragon Fruit on a Campfire, Fire Pit, or Star. It restores significantly more Health and slightly more Hunger than its raw counterpart. It can also be used as an ingredient in several Crock Pot recipes. Roasting the rotting Dragon Fruit is a good way to prepare fresher Dragonpie.

### Characteristics of Prepared Dragon Fruit

- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Icon**: ![Prepared Dragon Fruit](Prepared%20Dragon%20Fruit.png)
- **Image**: ![Prepared Dragon Fruit Dropped](Prepared%20Dragon%20Fruit%20Dropped.png)
- **Food Value**: Fruit × 1
- **HP Restored**: 20
- **Hunger Restored**: 12.5
- **Sanity Restored**: 0
- **Spoil**: 3 Days
- **Stack**: 40
- **Spawn Code**: "dragonfruit_cooked"

## Quotes on Prepared Dragon Fruit

- **Wilson**: The fruit's still weird.
- **Wendy**: Still not a dragon. At least it's dead.
- **Walter**: It makes sense that Dragon Fruit tastes better with fire.

## Obtaining in DLCs

- **Shipwrecked**: Dragon Fruits can be obtained by spending Dubloons at the Slot Machine and rolling three carrots.
- **Hamlet**: Dragon Fruits are easier to obtain, since their seeds can be bought for 10 Oincs at Miss Sow's Floral Arrangements.

## Usage

1. **Cooking**: Dragon Fruit can be cooked into Prepared Dragon Fruit.
2. **Birdcage**: Feeding a caged bird a Dragon Fruit can yield Dragon Fruit Seeds.
3. **Manure**: Dragon Fruits can be used to produce Manure.

- Winona: Well la-dee-da.
- Wortox: Feathers and horns go well together.
- Wurt: Look like bird, think like bird.
- Walter: And I thought my bird watching badge was a feather in my cap!
- Wanda: Oooh, how eclectic!
- Choose: Wilson

## Downloadable Content
In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, Feather Hats can be bought for 5 Oincs at **The Sow's Ear Hat Shop** in **Pig City**.

## Tips
- If trying to summon **Krampus** by killing birds without **Wickerbottom** and her **Books**, one can equip this hat while standing on **Grass Turf** to make a lot of birds spawn, then kill them with a **Boomerang** or another **Ranged Weapon** as they land on the ground.
- In the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC, the player can also farm birds by trapping a **Catcoon** in a 1x1 cage with no corners and wearing the Feather Hat. The Catcoon will kill the birds that land on the ground.

## Trivia
- The Feather Hat was added in the **Enter the Gobbler** update.
- The Feather Hat used to cost 100 Research points to craft, and it had a value of 10 Science Points when used on a Science Machine.
- Unlike most crafted items, one can actually see what each individual ingredient was used for. The two Crimson Feathers are in between the three Jet Feathers, and the Tentacle Spots are used for the headband. While the hat's side view seems to imply that there may be a total of four Crimson Feathers, with only two visible from the front and back, this may be unintentional.
- Although the Feather Hat is included in the crafting menu of **Don't Starve: Hamlet** worlds, there are no sources of Tentacle Spots in **Hamlet**, making it uncraftable without using the **Skyworthy** or buying at **The Sow's Ear Hat Shop**.

## Tips
For 100% water resistance, a player can hold an umbrella while wearing a **Battle Helm**, **Beefalo Hat**, **Breezy Vest**, **Football Helmet**, **Miner Hat**, **Rain Hat**, **Shelmet**, **Spiderhat**, **Straw Hat**, **Summer Frest**, or **Top Hat**.

## Trivia
- The Umbrella was added during **A Little Rain Must Fall** update of **Don't Starve's** beta testing period.
- Using Pig Skin to make an Umbrella may be a reference to **Robinson Crusoe's** umbrella.

The **Backpack** is a **Survival** **Item** that serves to expand the **character**'s inventory. It requires 4 **Cut Grass** and 4 **Twig**s to craft and a **Science Machine** to prototype. The Backpack itself cannot be placed in the inventory or in **Chest**s and only one may be equipped at a time.

When a Backpack is created, it automatically equips itself in the Chest Slot if it is available. Wearing the Backpack provides 8 additional inventory slots. This item uses the same equipment slot as **Armor** and Vests, which means wearing one requires sacrificing the benefits of the other. Unlike other items that go into the Chest slot, Backpacks do not have durability.

Although Backpacks cannot be placed in the inventory or in Chests, they can be dropped on the ground and used for storage. Any item hovered over a Backpack while it's on the ground will display the 'Store' option, allowing the pack to be filled without equipping it.

### Downloadable Content

In all DLCs, the Backpack is a flammable item. When set on **fire**, everything inside won't be affected by fire but the Backpack will eventually burn to **Ashes**, dropping anything it had inside. Care should be taken when dropping a backpack near a **campfire** to prevent it from burning. The backpack is not waterproof, and can thus get soaked and drain the player's **Sanity**, but items in the backpack will stay completely dry. If the player does not have full water protection, it is recommended to keep one's fuel and food items in a backpack during the rain.

In the **Hamlet** DLC, Backpacks can be bought in the **Pigg and Pigglet's General Store** for 5 **Oinc**s.

### Trivia

* The Backpack was added in the **Version History#November 27.2C 2012.C2.A0.E2.80.93 The Birds and the Bees .26 Dogs That Want to Kill You** update.

### Bugs

* A backpack can be burned and extinguished to be able to keep it in one's inventory. Relogging will reset this.
* Sometimes the player can't pick up a backpack in the Caves if it is dropped due to the player's death.

**Exclusivity:** Don't Starve Together

**Introduction:** The Moon Glass Axe is a version of the normal Axe that is exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. It can be crafted with 2 Twigs and 3 Moon Shards, however doing so requires that the player to be close to the Celestial Altar. It is 2.5 times more efficient than the normal Axe. This means that Small Trees will take 2 hits, medium Trees will take 4 hits, and large Trees will take 6 hits to be chopped down. When used to attack Shadow Creatures, Shadow Pieces or Reanimated Skeletons it will lose less durability, and vice versa, it will lose more applications if used to attack any other unit.

- Choose: Wolfgang

## Behavior
Rock Lobsters are neutral Mobs found in Caves. They eat all minerals except for Marble, all of which can be given to them to befriend them. They grow over time, slowly regenerate their health, and come in a variety of colors. They are also immune to the freezing effect of the Ice Staff.

When killed, they shatter and drop Meat, Rocks, and Flint. They can be found in the Rocky Plains Biome.

## Hunting
Rock Lobsters have high health and protect themselves from damage. They also live in herds and will defend each other when necessary. Additionally, their health slowly regenerates. All of this taken together means that Rock Lobsters are very difficult to kill. When possible, it's a good idea to separate one from the group before fighting it, or use ranged weapons since they are slow-moving, which allows for multiple hits in a short time.

Also an effective way to kill the Rock Lobster is to kite: hit it and run out of its range before it can hit back. It is also noted that while a Rock Lobster is sleeping, one can kill it with Gunpowder or Slurtle Slime, as once lit, those explosives will deal large amounts of damage to groups of sleeping Rock Lobsters, and they will not wake up and aggro the player. 9 Gunpowder can easily take out a fully grown Rock Lobster.

However, due to their incredibly high health, regeneration, damage absorption, and abysmal drops for the effort it would take to kill a Rock Lobster, it is almost never worth it to kill them, and even if you need them dead, leading them to hostile monsters would be a much better idea, as you'll get extra monster loot along with the death of the Rock Lobsters.

## Tips
* Rock Lobsters can take out most giants with little to no effort. Having high health and damage, regenerative abilities, and immunity to fire and ice, they are a good solution to any boss in the game, especially the Ancient Guardian.
* A group of Rock Lobsters can easily take out a herd of mating Beefalo if left unsupervised. However, one or two Rock Lobsters will easily be stopped by a large herd, as they will be hit too often to come out of hiding.
* Another above-ground use for these creatures is against hound attacks. By using Depths Worm Wave Extermination Guide, the player can easily defend against hounds. If hiding fails, simply run around the pen and let the hounds aggro onto the lobsters.
* After the April 27, 2015 Update not only was their overpopulation problem fixed, but also now if brought to the overworld, as soon as they stop following the player, they'll wander towards the closest Rocky Biome and will stay in its borders (

Cave Spiders are a Cave-dwelling type of Spider which have a shell-like carapace which they can close to hide and protect themselves from damage. They spawn from Spilagmites along with Spitters. They have one large red eye and a gaping maw with the shell making up their 'head'. Like the Spitter, Cave Spiders will emit low pitched roars, as opposed to the other spiders' high pitched gurgling growls.

### Hunting
Cave Spiders differ from other Spiders because of their shell-armor. After two hits, they will close up the shell which gain 75% Damage Reduction. After a few seconds, they will open their shell and begin to attack again, at which point they are vulnerable. These Spiders can be stunlocked while they are out of the shell and will stay inside as long as they are being attacked, which means they are relatively easy to kill with patience.

Cave Spiders will follow the character when wearing the Spiderhat. However, caution must be taken as the combination of the Spiderhat and multiple spider followers can drastically decrease Sanity, which can be difficult to manage since it is always considered Night underground. Also, it is important to watch the Spiderhat's durability level as the Cave Spiders and Spitters will become hostile when it runs out.

### Tips
- Be aware that Spilagmites will also spawn Spitters. Spilagmites can be mined to keep the spiders from respawning.
- Wolfgang can easily kill Cave Spiders with 3 hits from a Spear or 2 hits from a Tentacle Spike or Dark Sword. Dealing with Cave Spiders (as well as many other enemies) as a Werebeaver means one bite does the same damage as a hit from a Tentacle Spike.
- It is recommended that players equip a Miner Hat while fighting these creatures. It allows the player to see other mobs that might be attacking. Alternatively dropping one or more Lanterns in the area you're fighting is also effective, or better still aim to fight in an area that's already lit up naturally (e.g. by Light Flowers).
- Bunnymen are hostile to Cave Spiders and other

## Overview
Turkey Dinner is a Meat Food item cooked in the Crock Pot by adding 2 Raw Drumsticks, >1 units of Meat, and 0.5 units of Fruit or Vegetable. Any Drumsticks contribute to its meat demand. It takes 60 seconds to cook.

Adding a Mandrake may result in Mandrake Soup. 

Using Fried Drumsticks may result in Meatballs, as the recipe strictly requires uncooked drumsticks.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked DLCs, Turkey Dinner increases the player's perceived temperature by 1 degree per second for 10 seconds when consumed.

In the Hamlet DLC, Turkey Dinner can be bought for 10 Oincs at The Sterling Trough Deli.

## Prerequisites
- Requires: Drumstick
- Requires: Meats
- Requires: Vegetables or Fruit

## Recipe
| Item | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Drumstick | 2 |
| Meats | >1 |
| Vegetables/Fruit | 1 |

### Examples
1. Drumstick (2), Monster Meat, Mushrooms
2. Drumstick (2), Morsel, Berries
3. Drumstick (3), Mandrake (50% chance to result in Mandrake Soup)
4. Drumstick (2), Monster Meats, Durians (50% chance to result in Monster Lasagna)

## Tips
It is recommended to cook this Crock Pot recipe rather than to eat two Drumsticks on their own, as it restores more Health and Hunger than most of their recipe ingredients. Keep your drumsticks uncooked for this recipe, as this will not work with Fried Drumsticks.

## Trivia
During the Pig Fiesta event in the Hamlet DLC, Turkey Dinner takes on an even more festive appearance. While the Turkey Dinner can be made with either Fruits or Vegetables, the appearance of the item in-game appears to show berries in a similar appearance to cranberry sauce.

# Fish

<center>
| [Don't Starve](Fish) | [DST](Freshwater Fish) |
</center>

Fish is a Meat Food Item that typically comes from Ponds. It is also dropped by Merms. It restores 12.5 Hunger and stacks to 40 in the inventory. Fish can be dried on the Drying Rack for 1 day to produce Small Jerky, and are the main ingredient in Fishsticks and Fish Tacos using a Crock Pot. Fishing (like killing Gobblers) does not increase the player's Naughtiness level, meaning it is a safe food source for those fearing Krampus.

Unlike most other Meat Foods, Fish can be eaten raw without losing Sanity.

Fish can be obtained by using a Fishing Rod at a Pond or Lake, or dropped by Merms when killed (along with Frog Legs).

## Cooked Fish

Cooked Fish is obtained by cooking Fish at a Campfire, Fire Pit or Star. Unlike most foods, it is no different in hunger and health restoration than its raw version, though it spoils slower than raw fish. Like all cooked foods, it cannot be dried on a Drying Rack.

## Downloadable Content

In the Shipwrecked DLC, Fish can be obtained by using a Trawl Net in the Ocean.

In the Hamlet DLC, Fish and Cooked Fish have an alternate appearance based on carp. Fish can be obtained from Kingfishers or by destroying a Tasteful Fish Mounting.

## Usage

- **Cooking**: Fish → Cooked Fish
- **Drying**: Fish → Small Jerky
- **Crock Pot**: Surface Fish, Corns, Filler, Filler → Fish Tacos
- **Crock Pot**: Surface Fish, Twigs, Filler, Filler → Fishsticks
- **Crock Pot**: Monster Meats, Fish (x3) → Surf 'n' Turf

## Trivia

- When a Fish is on the ground, it flops around, then perishes, its eyes becoming crossed out.
- Fish having a spoilage time of 3 days could be a reference to one of Benjamin Franklin's quotes, "Guests are like fish. They stink after 3 days."

# Slurper

The Slurper is a creature found only in the Ruins, in Wilds, Village, and rarely in the Mushtree Forest biome. It attacks by rolling to and biting the target and then jumping up and engulfing the player's head with its mouth.

## Information Box
- **Name:** Slurper
- **Equip Slot:** Head
- **Diet:** Veggie ![Veggie](Veggie.png)
- **Health:** 200
- **Damage:** 30
- **Attack Period:** 5
- **Attack Range:** 8
- **Walk Speed:** 9
- **Special Ability:** Provides light while awake.
- **Drops:** Light Bulb x2, Slurper Pelt 50%
- **Spawn Code:** "slurper"
- **Sanity Bonus:** -25/min
- **Hunger Bonus:** -100/min
- **Durability:** Unlimited
- **Perk:** Emits light.
- **Stack:** Cannot stay in inventory

## Quotes
- Wolfgang: No! No! Stay off head!
- Wilson: It's so hairy!
- Willow: Do they have little fires in their bellies?
- Woodie: I think it's living hair.
- Maxwell: Simple creatures. They exist only to sleep and feed.
- Wagstaff: Truly outstanding ocular sockets!
- Wendy: Ah, to be so simple.
- Woodlegs: Yer an ugly scallywag.
- Wickerbottom: A classic example of symbiosis.
- Webber: Hairy tongue thing!
- Warly: It is not polite to slurp.
- WX78: IT VIOLATED MY SMELLING MODULE.
- Walani: It's a little gross, but who am I to judge?
- Wigfrid: The fur foe thinks she's a hat!
- Wilba: WHAT LIGHT THROUGH YONDER FUR BREAKS?
- Wormwood: Furry Head Eater
- Wheeler: I'll make you a deal: you keep your slobber, I'll keep my brain.
- Winona: It's just a mouth!
- Wortox: Please keep that mouth to yourself!
- Wurt: Ha ha, tickly!
- Walter: Hey little guy!
- Wanda: I can't decide how I feel about them...

## Behavior
Slurpers will actively hunt down the player by charging at them in a straight line, dealing damage to a struck target, followed by a lunging attack attempting to latch onto the player's head. If successful, it will begin to drain hunger from the player until removed or the player dies.

## Tips
- Slurpers can be brought to the surface while attached to a player's head. They cannot break walls, and therefore can easily be kept as pets that provide an almost infinite light source.
- Despite covering the character's head, an equipped Slurper will not prevent the player from eating, or reading if playing as Wickerbottom or Maxwell, or shaving their beard if playing as Webber or Wilson.

## Trivia
- Slurpers were added in the 'Hungry For Your Hunger' update and are the reason why this update was dubbed so.
- Before the 'The Stuff of Nightmares' update, Slurpers dropped Beard Hair instead of Slurper Pelts, and they spawned in Caves instead of the Ruins.

# Batilisks

_Batilisks_ are flying [Mobs] that live in [Caves] and are commonly found on [Stalagmite Terrains]. They come to the surface through unplugged [Sinkholes] at [Dusk] and to [Caves] from unplugged [Ruins] [Sinkholes] when it gets dark.

- **Damage**: 20
- **Diet**: [Meat] 
- **Attack Period**: 1
- **Attack Range**: 1.5
- **Run Speed**: 
- **Sanity Drain**: 
- **Drops**: [Guano] (15%), [Batilisk Wing] (25%), [Monster Meat] (10%)

- **Spawn Code**: "bat"
- **Spawn From**: [Sinkhole], [Ruins Entrance], [Ancient Pseudoscience Station]

## Quotes

- **Wendy**: A creature of the night.
- **WX-78**: FLYING RAT
- **Wickerbottom**: A flying mammal.

- **Choose**: woodie

## Hunting

Multiple Batilisks will join together and swarm the [Character]s (and other [mobs]), circling them. They will let out a cry before breaking their circle to attack and will charge straight at their target, allowing for timed attacks or kiting if multiple choose to attack at one time.

When facing many Batilisks underground, it is often helpful to bring a [Bunnyman] along for assistance. Batilisks and [Bunnymen] are naturally aggressive towards each other. As long as the player keeps running, Batilisks can't get an attack in (much like most mobs). A safe and efficient way to kill them is to lead them to some [Bunnymen]. Batilisks also engage in battle with [Spiders], [Spitters] and [Cave Spiders], and eat the meat they dropped.

To farm Batilisks, stand next to an open [Sinkhole] and hit them as soon as they spawn at dusk. Because of their somewhat predictable attack pattern, they can be smacked as they squeak, or the player can even run in the direction a circling Batilisk is about to go.

In [Winter], fewer Batilisks emerge from the [sinkhole] than normal. Players are advised to start hunting in summer for maximum loot.

Batilisks can be tracked by their [Guano]. The player can determine a distance to camp from an open [sinkhole] by checking how far away from the [Sinkhole] the piles of [Guano] are.

[Naked Mole Bat|Naked Mole Bats] aid Batilisks in battle. If an batilisk is hurt or killed, nearby Mole Bats will join the fight and attack the attacker. It should be avoided to fight them near Mole Bats.

## Tips

- Batilisks can travel approximately 20 [pitchfork tiles] away from their home sinkhole.
- Batilisks only respawn during [Day] time. If using a world setting that removes Day time (such as the Lights Out preset) Batilisks will no longer spawn from sinkholes after they have been killed.

## Trivia

- The name "Batilisk" is a portmanteau of "bat" and "basilisk".
- In the first pass ("pre-alpha") of Caves, Batilisk spawn rates were high, leading to swarms of (at one point) 40-50.
- Batilisks used to die immediately after eating [Monster Meat] due to their low [health]. This was changed in the '[All's Well That Maxwell]' update.
- The fact that fewer Batil

- **Walter**: Hey, free meat!
- **Wanda**: I'm not falling for that old trick!
- **Choose**: Wigfrid

The **Lureplant** is a hostile plant which is so named for its behavior of dangling [meats] to attract prey. Like [Krampus], a Lureplant has its own inventory, which is filled with the items its Eyeplants (see below) have stored but not yet digested. It has the capability of storing and digesting just about anything that can fit in the player's inventory.

When a Lureplant is ready to produce a lure but no meat is available, it will produce [Leafy Meat] as a lure instead. This lure, along with any other meats the Lureplant may use as bait, may be harvested by unequipping any weapon so that the option to "harvest meat" appears instead of "attack". When a meat is successfully harvested from a Lureplant, all Eyeplants will disappear, and the bulb will revert to a "just planted" look. The bulb will not display another meat until it is capable of producing Eyeplants 2 days later. If a Lureplant dangles the same lure for more than the time it takes for the lure to spoil, harvesting it will give nothing. The player can hit the Lureplant to make it retract its empty tendril, and soon, it'll come out again with a fresh Leafy Meat. During [Winter], Lureplants will withdraw their roots and Eyeplants, producing no lures. When a Lureplant with Leafy Meat is attacked by a [Frog], the leafy meat will be stolen by the frog and the Lureplant will immediately produce another Leafy Meat.

Without any damage multipliers, Lureplants take 9 hits with a [Spear], 8 with a [Bat Bat], 6 with a [Tentacle Spike], [Ham Bat], and [Thulecite Club], and 5 with a [Dark Sword] to die. Killing a Lureplant will also allow the player to collect one Leafy Meat in addition to any items the Lureplant has collected in its inventory, but has not yet been digested. Additionally, a Lureplant will always drop a [Fleshy Bulb] after death, which may be replanted on any valid turf.

Every player, who has stayed on surface world for 1440-2400 seconds in spring, has a 1/(number of players on surface when the random draw is done) chance of spawning a Lureplant. If there is only 1 player on the Surface during spring, provided the player does not visit the Caves or disconnect, a Lureplant would spawn by 2400 seconds of spring time. Visiting the Caves or disconnecting will reset the Lureplant timer, hence interrupting the Lureplant spawn. The Crabby Hermit's island will spawn a Lureplant on day 36.

## Description
Gunpowder is a Science Item and explosive Weapon. It requires 1 Rotten Egg, 1 Charcoal, and 1 Nitre to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Rotten Eggs are produced by waiting for Eggs to rot, and can usually be found in Pengull nests sometime after Winter ends. Charcoal can be obtained by burning trees. Nitre is dropped from mining boulders, or by digging up Moleworm burrows in the Reign of Giants DLC.

When placed and lit on fire, Gunpowder will explode after 3–6 seconds, destroying objects and dealing massive damage in a small radius (less than three Wall unit, or 3/4th of a Turf unit). It deals 200 damage per charge and can be exploded in stacks, which is more than enough to instantly kill an unarmored character at full health (with the exception of Wigfrid, an upgraded WX-78 or (DS only) Wolfgang). This damage is not affected by a Character's damage multipliers.

## Downloadable Content
In the Shipwrecked DLC, Gunpowder can be used to craft Coconades and Boat Cannons. It can also be used to destroy Obsidian Boulders. Gunpowder sinks in the water, meaning it cannot be used to fight the Sealnado, Tiger Shark, or Quacken in the water. 

In the Hamlet DLC, Gunpowder can be used to load the Blunderbuss, a ranged weapon dealing 200 damage. It can also be used to destroy Suspicious Cracks in the Ancient Pig Ruins.

## Recipes
### Coconade (Shipwrecked)
- Coconut: 1
- Gunpowder: 1
- Rope: 1
- Tool: Science Machine
- Result: Coconade

### Boat Cannon (Shipwrecked)
- Log: 5
- Gunpowder: 4
- Coconut: 6

## Trivia
- Gunpowder was added in the "A Little Rain Must Fall" update.
- Gunpowder explosions can cause structures to drop their resource, but not if they are on fire.
- Gunpowder explosions have the same lighting effect as a Lightning strike.
- In earlier versions of the game, Gunpowder explosions in Caves could cause Earthquakes.
- Real-life black powder is made by combining charcoal (carbon), nitre (potassium nitrate), and sulfur which is mistakenly believed to smell like rotten eggs (an average egg contains about 0

# Bone Helm

The Bone Helm is an **Armor Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It is dropped by the **Ancient Fuelweaver** along with the **Bone Armor** and **Shadow Thurible**. It absorbs 70% of damage done by physical attacks and provides 20% **Wetness** resistance.

## Details

- **Deconstruct**: {{pic32|Nightmare Fuel}}×4 {{pic32|Bone Shards}}×10
- **Image**: ![Bone Helm Dropped](Bone_Helm_Dropped.png)
- **Icon**: ![Bone Helm](Bone_Helm.png)
- **Equip Slot**: Head
- **Scrapbook Description**: Wearing this will drive you instantly insane; even the shadows will tolerate you.
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "skeletonhat"
- **Water Resistance**: 20% resistance
- **Durability**: 945 hp
- **Dropped By**: {{Pic|24px|Reanimated_Skeleton_Atrium|Reanimated Skeleton}}
- **Sanity Drain**: -20/min
- **Perk**: Induces insanity effects. Prevents Shadow Creatures and Nightmare Creatures from attacking.
- **Protection**: 70%

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: It gives me terrible visions.
- **Willow**: I've got a headache just looking at it.
- **Wolfgang**: Puts scary pictures in Wolfgang's head.
- **Wendy**: A tortured mind dwelled within.
- **WX-78**: IT IS EVIL, LIKE ME
- **Wickerbottom**: It has a detrimental effect on the mortal mind.
- **Woodie**: That right there's a cursed object, eh?
- **Maxwell**: A most tragic and unfitting end.
- **Wigfrid**: Immörtal's sight was nöt meant för thee.
- **Webber**: It's not very comfy.
- **Winona**: Makes me a little uneasy. Heh heh...
- **Warly**: Un chapeau effrayant.
- **Wortox**: Ooohoo, it tickles my little imp-y brain!
- **Wormwood**: Scary head
- **Wurt**: Glurph... head feel funny...
- **Walter**: Good thing they had such a thick skull, this makes a great helmet!
- **Wanda**: I don't want to put a dead thing on my head!

## Behavior

When in groups, attacking one will cause the other Shadow Creatures to become aggressive towards the player. They remain aggressive for about 2 minutes, and then they will become neutral again. If one player is wearing the helm and another is insane, the creatures will spawn to hunt the insane player while keeping the other one completely unharmed.

## Skins

* The **Woven - Elegant Shadow Helmet** skin was introduced in the **An Eye for An Eye** update in 2021, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's **Terraria**. Its rarity was **Inspired - Elegant** initially, but received change in August 19, 2022.

## Trivia

* The Bone Helm was added in a **Bonus Update** after the completion of **A New Reign**.
* While wearing a Bone Helm, neutral **Shadow Creatures** (and Nightmare Creatures) will often perform their attack animation when near the player, then back away.
* The deconstruction effect suggests the Helm is constructed of bone fragments bound by Nightmare Fuel, which means that the Ancient Fuelweaver is not destroyed when he is killed, but is rather bound back to the shadow dimension while some parts of him that were bound by the nightmare residue remain intact and bound by the "flesh" of the Fuelweaver long after he is obliterated. This in turn may mean that all shadow creatures are never killed, but just transport back to the shadow dimension, leaving behind the residue - Nightmare Fuel.

## Tips

* The Bone Helm can be used to farm **Nightmare Fuel** from Shadow Creatures or **Rabbit|Beardlings** as the Shadow Creatures will remain passive and will not hurt the player.
* Alternatively, if the player approaches low Sanity in Caves or elsewhere one can not gain Sanity easily, Bone Helm can be worn to immediately lower the Sanity to 0 with no negative side effects.
