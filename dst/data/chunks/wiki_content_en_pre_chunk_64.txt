## Hunting Strategy
The Damaged Bishop is a moderately strong ranged mob. It is recommended to be armored and armed for battle. Dodging the Bishop's lightning bolts is possible if the player is quick enough. Tanking the damage with armor and repeatedly hitting the Bishop until death is also an option, but healing items are recommended.

## Description

The **Executive Hammer** is an **Item** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It can be acquired by opening the respective **Royal Gallery Exhibit** with a **Royal Gallery Key** in the **Pig Queen** **Palace**. The Executive Hammer can be used to permanently destroy **Town Houses**, **Pig Shops**, **Watch Towers**, **Lawn Decorations**, **Intricate Topiaries**, and **Hedges**, as opposed to reducing them to a repairable pile of rubble with the **Hammer**. Destroying a **Town House**, **Pig Shop**, or **Watch Tower** will drop half the resources required to build the object in the **City Planning Tab**; however, any nearby **Royal Guards** will become hostile to the player.

Like the normal **Hammer**, the Executive Hammer can also be used to "whack" **Moleworms**, which will stun them.

**Banana Pop** is a [[Crock Pot]] recipe that is made from 1 [[Banana]], 1 [[Ice]], and 1 [[Twigs|Twig]]. Its cooking ingredients cannot contain any kind of [[Meats]] or [[Fishes|Fish]]. Adding [[Wobster]], [[Fishes]] or [[Meats]] will result in [[Lobster Bisque]], [[Fishsticks]] and [[Kabobs]] respectively.

It restores 20 {{Hp}}, 12.5 {{Hunger}}, and 33 {{Sanity}}, and reduces body temperature by 1 degree per second for 10 seconds. It is a great [[Sanity]] restoring food as Ice is abundant in Winter.

As a non-meat item, [[Wigfrid]] cannot eat it. It is also the [[favourite food]] of [[Wendy]], restoring an additional 15 {{Hunger}} when she consumes them.

# Frog Rain

## Overview

Frog Rain is an exclusive feature in the Reign of Giants DLC for Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together. During Spring, frogs can rain from the sky, announced by the raining sounds getting significantly louder. This is very dangerous because frogs attack the player when they are too close. It is advised to wander away from base during this type of rain since the game will keep dropping frogs wherever the player goes. Frogs produced from rain will stay on the field as long as it is raining, and while they don't sleep at night, they will stand in place. Frogs do eventually despawn after the rain ends.

## Effects

- **Sanity Loss:** Up to -5/min
- **Effects:** Regrows [Blue Mushroom](#), [Red Mushroom](#), and [Green Mushroom](#), Regrows Flowers.<br>Spawns ![Frog](#)

## Strategy

### Trapping Frogs

Traps can be used to deal with the frogs and to obtain [Frog Legs](#), which can be used to make [Froggle Bunwich](#). 

### Using Beefalo Herd

Another strategy to get rid of frogs is to quickly move to a [Beefalo](#) herd as soon as a frog rain starts. Beefalos are in heat during Spring and will attack the frogs. If the Beefalo herd is small, a large number of frogs may end up winning the fight. While the Beefalos are in heat, a [Beefalo Hat](#) should be worn when picking up the Frog Legs to prevent Beefalos from attacking. The Frog Legs can be used as food but cannot be traded to the [Pig King](#) for [Gold Nugget](#)s nor the [Antlion](#) for [Desert Stone](#)s directly. However, using a [Birdcage](#), they can be exchanged for [Eggs](#) which can be traded.

### Abigail's Assistance

[Abigail](#) can also deal with a large number of frogs, but it doesn't take long until she's overwhelmed. However, in Don't Starve Together, she is much more durable, and can be given a [Ghostly Elixir](#) (Spectral Cure-All) to heal at a much faster rate than the frogs can damage her. Given the Wendy player has enough Spectral Cure-Alls in their inventory, this is not only a way to keep safe during the Frog Rain but also to consistently farm hundreds of Frog Legs.

## Description
Jelly-O Pop is a [[Crock Pot]] dish exclusive in the ''[[Shipwrecked]]'' DLC. It is made from any form of [[Jellyfish]] ([[Dead Jellyfish|Dead/Cooked Jellyfish]] and [[Dried Jellyfish]]), 1 [[Ice]] and 1 [[Inedibles|Inedible]].

Adding a [[Wobster]] will yield [[Lobster Bisque]] instead. Adding an extra 1.0 unit of [[Fishes|fish]] may yield [[Ceviche]] instead. Adding [[Shark Fin]] may yield [[Shark Fin Soup]] instead. Despite Jellyfish being a [[Monster Food]], adding another Monster Food like [[Monster Meat]] will not yield [[Monster Lasagna]] because the [[Crock Pot#Priority|Crock Pot Priority]] of this recipe is higher than Monster Lasagna.

It restores 20 {{Hp}} and 12.5 {{Hunger}}, and reduces body temperature by 1 degree per second for 10 seconds. Jelly-O Pop is similar to [[Banana Pop]], but without the [[Sanity]] gain.

# Rain

Rain is a type of weather that occurs somewhat randomly during summer in the base [[Don't Starve]] game and at an increased rate during the [[Spring]] season in the [[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants]] DLC. It has various effects on the game world and on the player's [[Sanity]]. The chance of rain can be predicted by building a [[Rainometer]], much like the [[Thermal Measurer]] measures temperature. Instead of rain during the [[Winter]], it will snow, except during first and last days of winter.

## Effects

- Add [[Wetness]]
- Regrows [[Mushroom#Blue Mushroom]] [[Mushroom#Red Mushroom]] [[Mushroom#Red Mushroom]], Regrows Flowers.

## Spawns

- Rarely spawns [[Frog]]

## Negative Effects

In the [[Reign of Giants]] DLC, rain causes [[wetness]] to the player. High wetness makes burnable items such as [[Log|logs]] less useful, reduces sanity if the player wears wet wearable items, increases the spoilage rate of [[food]], and adds a number of other additional effects to items in the world. Unlike the vanilla game however, the rain won't decrease one's sanity straight away, rather the wetness does as it gets higher. The chance of rain will change depending on the season, with [[Spring]] having very frequent rains while it rains in moderate amount during [[Summer]] and [[Autumn]]. Although it may seem like a minor change to the game, this new mechanic has caused starting the game in Spring to be difficult (especially while using [[WX-78]]), due to [[freezing]] and major sanity loss.

There is also a strong possibility of getting struck by lightning if there aren't any objects (trees, [[grass]] or any burnable item) or creatures in the vicinity, which will deal 10-20 damage to the player, depending on their wetness. This can be prevented by using a [[Rain Coat]], [[Rain Hat]] or [[Eyebrella]]. Or strike any nearby object that can catch fire, such as [[Tree]]s, [[Sapling]]s, flammable structures, or even creatures. If structures or plants are too close together, such as in a [[Berry Bush|Berry]] farm, lightning can quickly cause a devastating fire. Effects caused by lightning can easily be avoided by crafting a [[Lightning Rod]].

In rain, [[Fire#Fuel Values|fuel]] extinguishes faster (depending on ''precipitation rate''):
- '''Fire Pit''' up to 200% faster
- '''Campfire''' up to 250% faster
- '''[[Torch]]''' up to 150% faster
- '''[[Willow's Lighter]]''' up to 100% faster.

## Positive Effects

In rain, [[Farm]] crops grow up to 300% faster (depending on ''precipitation rate''). Additionally, [[Mushrooms]] that have already been picked will only regrow after it rains. When it rains there are occasional lightning strikes that, if struck by when playing [[WX-78]] , will give you a boost for up to 1 day. 
[[Birds]] spawn 4 times faster during rain.

## Special Rain

### Snow

In the [[Forest World]], When the [[Global Temperature]] is below 5 (which usually only happens in [[Winter]]), Rain will be converted to Snow. Snow will not increase the Wetnees value, nor will it have any other effect on the player. It will cover the ground with a layer of snow instead of standing water, making it difficult to see the land. The snow will melt away during the summer or winter rains.

### Frog Rain

During Spring [[Frog]]s can rain from the sky, announced by the raining sounds getting significantly louder.

### Acid Rain

In the [[Cave World]], if a [[Shadow Rift]] exists, Rain will be converted to [[Acid Rain]].

## Precipitation trend

Precipitation in the Forest world and the Cave world do not affect each other, operate independently of each other, and the mechanism is exactly the same, except that rain in the forest world turns into snow in winter.

## Rain value

The Rain value determines the beginning and end of rain in the world. The Rain value will continue to increase when there is no rain, rain begins when it reaches the upper limit of Rain value, and rain stops when it reaches the lower limit of Rain value. The Rain value will not exceed the Rain value upper limit or fall below the Rain value lower limit.

At the end of each rain, a new random value of the Rain value limit will be taken according to the current season.

## Winter's Feast

During [[Winter's Feast]], snowflakes in winter can have

## Description
The Metal Potato Thing is one of four Things used on the Wooden Thing to travel to the next world. It spawns naturally in every world in its own Set Piece. It is located near some Basic Farms, which are surrounded by some Grass and Twigs, a Shovel, and unpicked Carrots.

There are two versions of it, one that spawns in Survival Mode and one in Adventure Mode. The only other difference is the color scheme. Player can craft a Divining Rod to help them track the Metal Potato Thing.

The only purpose of the Metal Potato Thing is to be used on the Wooden Thing. It's an important gameplay item and as such it cannot be destroyed or stolen by Mobs (e.g. Krampus, Splumonkeys etc.).

## Trivia
- The Metal Potato Thing is actually a robotic Maxwell's head. Calling it a potato may just be making fun of the game's antagonist, though being near a farm make the potato similarities more obvious.
- It is the reason the Wooden Thing, when fully constructed, is more commonly referred to as the 'Teleportato'.
- It may be a reference to the game Portal 2, in which deuteragonist Wheatley puts the antagonist GLaDOS into a potato battery. This is reinforced by WX-78's quote, as seen above.
- Although exclusive to the original Don't Starve, Don't Starve Together files contain quotes from exclusive characters.

# Cyclum Puzzles

![MaxAndWilson](File:MaxAndWilson.png =300x)

> "Spooky." - Wilson

The **Cyclum Puzzles** are a set of comic panels that explain the gap between the events of **Maxwell**'s freedom and the events of **Don't Starve Together**. Starting from April 21, 2016, until the 29th, the [Cyclum web page](http://cyclum.dontstarvetogether.com/) would update daily revealing a new piece of the comic and puzzle. In some cases, the page may also require participation from the page visitor to advance further.

Reaching the last step of the puzzle would reward players with the Tragic Torch cosmetic **Skin** for use in **Don't Starve Together**. For the purposes of saving a participant's progress and rewarding them with the torch, it is required for the user to log into [Steam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software)) to advance the puzzle.

On 4/10/2017, the Cyclum puzzle was reopened for completion to all players. Upon completion, players were gifted the Tragic Torch skin in game.

Tragic Torches received before reopening received a quality update to Timeless.

Once players complete the Cyclum Puzzles and receive the in-game gift item, the **Tragic Torch**, players can proceed on to the **Metheus Puzzles**.

## The Puzzles

### First Puzzle (Page 1)
**Submit:** Infirmus

This word is hidden in the trees in the 11th panel.

After entered, shadow creatures will be revealed chasing and surrounding Maxwell.

### Second Puzzle (Page 1)
**The Garland:**
Collect all the 11 flowers on the ground and Maxwell's Rose on the last panel. The flowers will not disappear once you collect them (This may not always work depending on your browser settings).

### Third Puzzle (Page 1)
**The Camp in the center of the focus:**
On the last panel of page 1, click on the fire, it will reveal Wilson's camp.

### Fourth Puzzle (Page 2)
**Submit:** PULVIS ET UMBRA SUMUS (We are but dust and shadows.)

Words Ode, Book and Line were hidden in the page.

In the bottom of the page, there was a hidden ASCII art of **Maxwell Statue**, on it there was one of the numbers 4, 7 and 16, varying between users.

The words led to Horace's Odes:

- Book 4
- Ode 7
- Line 16

This puzzle will unlock Page 3, then Ragtime will start playing in the background.

### Fifth Puzzle (Page 3)
**The Kabobs:**
Click the elements in any order:
1. The stick Wilson is holding in the first panel
2. The fallen trap in the very right of the second panel
3. Both berry bushes on the third panel
4. The firepit in the third panel
5. The **Crock Pot** in the third panel

This will unlock the rest of the page 3 and also make the page 2 full of roses, part of the sixth puzzle.

### Sixth Puzzle (Page 2)
**H.E.I.R.- Morse code hidden in the static played after the Ragtime stops playing (only happens after the fifth puzzle).**

After clicking on all the roses of the panels in each letter of the hidden ChARLIE name, found earlier written in black-red in the borders in page 2, in the same order of H-E-I-R, a secret video and page 4 will be unlocked.

![HEIR roses](File:HEIR roses.png =540x540px center)

## The Story
The story was split into 4 pages plus a secret video. It starts with Maxwell falling out of a portal and being dropped into his own world. After recovering from his fall, a **Spider** approaches him with aggressive intent. Maxwell raises his hand to attack the spider using shadow magic, but nothing happens. Realizing he lost his powers after being freed, Maxwell flees from the pack of **Hounds** and spiders.

After escaping, Maxwell experiences the effects of **Insanity** and is surrounded by **Shadow Creatures**, to which he then puts a **Garland** on his head to drive them away. As nightfall approaches, Maxwell notices a bright light and smoke in the distance. He begins to walk towards it to escape the dangers of darkness. As he approaches it, Maxwell discovers Wilson eating a carrot he just finished roasting in a fire pit. Curious, Maxwell watches Wilson in secret while hiding behind a berry bush. Suddenly, Wilson is startled by the sound of Maxwell stepping on a stick. He grabs

# Phlegm

Phlegm is an edible [Item] obtained by killing a [Ewecus]. When eaten, it will restore [Hunger] and reduce [Sanity].

However, Pigs will still eat Phlegm left on the floor, so it could be used in a Pig farm as a substitute for [Powdercake] since it does not spoil.

# Birchnutter

The **Birchnutter** is a small, round **monster** that is spawned in groups by **Poison Birchnut Trees**. They attack their target by leaping at them, dealing 5 damage on each hit. They are spawned periodically to defend the Poison Birchnut Tree. The large amount of Birchnutters, along with the Poison Birchnut Tree's dangerous roots, make it fairly challenging to cut the tree down. Their attack is avoidable however, and Birchnutters are easy to kill individually. Birchnutters drop **Twigs** or **Birchnut**s, meaning they are a good way to farm Birchnuts.

Birchnutters, unlike **Eyeplants**, can spawn from any kind of turf. They take one hit from an **Ice Staff** to be frozen, but can't be put to sleep. Instead, they go back underground when a **Pan Flute** or other similar **items** are used against them.

# Ashes

**Ashes** are an **Item** dropped after a flammable object has been burnt by **Fire** (some exceptions such as **Trees**), including the remnants of a **Campfire** and a destroyed **Pig Torch** or **Fire Pit**. Ashes will also replace any item that is not allowed to be carried through to the next **World** via the **Wooden Thing** (e.g. the **Eye Bone** or **Webber's Skull**). Ashes are also an ingredient for crafting **Healing Salve**. Moleworms will take them like minerals such as rocks or flint.

**Mobs** that are killed while on fire will drop Ashes in place of any non-cookable items (including non-flammable items like gears or gems) in their loot table, while cookable items are replaced with their cooked version. **Red Hounds** always drop 3 Ashes when killed. Ashes are blown away by the wind after being on the ground for 20 seconds (picking it up and then dropping it again resets the timer). Burning a stack of items will yield the same amount of Ashes. For example, burning 40 **Twigs** will result in 40 Ashes.

Ashes can be acquired by touching the burnt **Spiky Bushes** included in the Dragonfly **Set Piece**.

## Usage

### Healing Salve Recipe
- **Ingredients**: 2 Ashes, 1 Spider Gland, 2 Rocks
- **Tool**: Science Machine
- **Result**: Healing Salve

### Sisturn Recipe (Wendy)
- **Ingredients**: 1 Ash, 3 Cut Stone, 3 Boards
- **Result**: Sisturn

### Growth Formula Starter Recipe
- **Ingredients**: 1 Empty Bottle (DST), 1 Kelp Fronds, 1 Ash
- **Tool**: Science Machine
- **Result**: Growth Formula Starter

### Healing Glop Recipe (Webber)
- **Ingredients**: 2 Ash, 2 Silk, 2 Honey
- **Result**: Healing Glop

## Tips

* Due to their abundance and minimal use, **Pine Cones** and **Jungle Tree Seeds** are good candidates to burn and get Ashes.
* In DST, they can be farmed by setting a **Mush Gnome** on fire where it will spawn multiple Lunar Spores that will quickly burn and turn into Ashes.

## Scrapbook Info
A working heart that needs a new body.

## Description
The **Shadow Atrium** is a **Don't Starve Together** exclusive item, introduced in **A New Reign**. It is dropped by killing a level 3 **Shadow Piece**. It can be used to revive the **Odd Skeleton** to spawn a **Reanimated Skeleton**. If consumed by an **Ornery Chest**, it will become a **Possessed Shadow Atrium**.

Killing the **Ancient Fuelweaver** will consume the Shadow Atrium used to spawn it.

If the Ancient Fuelweaver dies by stepping out of the **Ancient Gateway** area, or by pulling the key out, he will drop the Shadow Atrium and the **Fossil Fragments** instead of his usual drops.

## Usage
### Recipe
- **Item 1:** Shadow Atrium
- **Tool:** Ornery Chest
- **Result:** Possessed Shadow Atrium

## Trivia
- The Shadow Atrium was added alongside the Shadow Pieces in the **Arts and Crafts** update, but it could not be used until the **Heart of the Ruins** update.
- An **atrium** is one of the top chambers in which blood enters the heart.

## Gathering
A Rotten Egg is produced by allowing an uncooked Egg to spoil. Unlike most foods, which turn to Rot when they spoil, Eggs become Rotten Eggs.

- **Fertilizer**: Rotten Eggs can be used to fertilize crops.
- **Fuel**: Rotten Eggs can be used as fuel in a Campfire or Fire Pit.
- **Crafting**: Rotten Eggs can also be used to craft Gunpowder; an explosive which deals 200 damage and can destroy most structures.
- **Sources**: 
  - Eggs come from Birds imprisoned in Birdcages. Feeding the Bird any Meat (besides raw Monster Meat except in DST) will produce an Egg. Once the Egg is allowed to spoil, it will become a Rotten Egg.
  - Rotten Eggs can also be found lying on the ground in Pengull nesting areas at the end of Winter, a quick and safe way to obtain many Rotten Eggs.
  - In Don't Starve Together, imprisoning a Misshapen Bird or a Moonblind Crow in a Birdcage and feeding it any Meat food will result in a Rotten Egg instead of a fresh Egg.

## Usage
### Gunpowder Recipe
- **Ingredients**: Rotten Egg, Charcoal, Nitre
- **Result**: Gunpowder
- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine

### Sulfuric Experiment Recipe
- **Ingredients**: Rotten Egg, Charcoal

# Emotes in Don't Starve Together

Emotes are a type of Curio in Don't Starve Together that allows the player to have their character perform an action by typing the corresponding command into the chat. Several commands can be used by default, such as: /happy, /angry, /no, /bonesaw, /dance, /facepalm, /joy, /kiss, /pose, /rude, /cry, /wave, /sit, /squat, /toast, /pet, and /bigpet. Some of these commands (such as dance, sit, and squat) are looped and will continue playing until the characters move or are hit.

## Default Emotes

Some default Emotes have alternate commands, listed in the table below in parentheses underneath the main command.

## Unlockable Emotes

There are Emotes that are either weaved with Spools, unlocked by completing Skin ensembles, or dropped through Chests (either purchased through the Shop or earned by leveling up), the in-game drops, or the daily skin reward when opening the game. They cannot be traded or sold on the Steam market. Emotes can be previewed in the Curio Cabinet.

# Glommer's Goop

## Overview
Glommer's Goop is a Food Item dropped by Glommer periodically every 2-4 Days, or during their death. It serves multiple purposes including being used as fuel for a Fire (with a fuel value of 360 seconds on a Fire Pit and 180 seconds on a Campfire), providing health and hunger restoration but decreasing sanity, and being used as a fertilizer for Farming.

## Details
- **Fertilize**: Consumes Growth Formula, Restores Compost, Manure Garden
- **Food Type**: Generic
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Image**: ![](http://example.com/Glommer's%20Goop%20Dropped.png)
- **Icon**: ![](http://example.com/Glommer's%20Goop.png)
- **Dropped By**: Glommer
- **HP Restored**: 40, 2 + 4 over 4 seconds with Wormwood
- **Hunger Restored**: 9.375
- **Sanity Restored**: -50, 0 with Wormwood
- **Stack**: 20
- **Spawn Code**: "glommerfuel"
- **Burn Time**: 360/180 sec

## Quotes
- Wilson: This goop smells foul.
- Willow: It's goopy and weird.
- Wolfgang: Weird bug make weird poop.
- Wendy: Fuzzball excrement.
- WX-78: SLIME OF UNCLEAR ORIGINS
- Wickerbottom: It appears to be quite volatile.
- Woodie: Yep, his slime is slimy too.
- Maxwell: Well, that's rank.
- Wagstaff: An entirely innovative source of energy!
- Wigfrid: This slöp cöuld be useful.
- Webber: Yucky muck!
- Walani: I'll make sure it goes to good use.
- Warly: Looks like bubblegum, tastes like floor.
- Woodlegs: Leaves a mess on me deck, but Woodlegs loves 'em.
- Wilba: 'TIS FOOD OF BUG.
- Wormwood: Yum! (urp)
- Wheeler: I have to find a good use for it before it stinks up the place.
- Winona: Doesn't look useful.
- Wortox: This stuff's so funny!
- Wurt: Bug goop.
- Walter: Don't eat it, Woby!
- Wanda: Oh. Droppings. How lovely.

## Usage
### Crafting Recipes
1. **Glomglom**
   - Ingredients: Glommer's Goop + Taffy
   - Tool: Rock Den

2. **Tree Jam**
   - Ingredients: Glommer's Goop + Fig x2
   - Tool: Alchemy Engine

3. **Hostile Flare**
   - Ingredients: Glommer's Goop + Flare x3

### Tips
- Wormwood uses it to fertilize himself instead of eating it, allowing you to heal without the negative sanity effect.
- The sanity penalty can be helpful in scenarios such as farming Nightmare Fuel from Shadow Creatures, lowering an Insanity Obelisk, or going to the Lunar Island.
- It is especially useful against the Celestial Champion since it heals as much as a Pierogi and greatly lowers Enlightenment.

### Trivia
- The first ever crafting recipe for this item was Glomglom added in DST.
- When eaten by Walter, he will start singing a song.

## Behavior and Hunting
The Kingfisher spawns and lands on most turfs. It can eat both Meats and Seeds and has a chance to drop Fish instead of Seeds. They fly down from off-screen and peck the ground for a few moments, then fly away. When they take flight, there is a chance that Seeds are left behind, unless it's interiors. Birds will also be attracted to Seeds left on the ground. If the player or most other mobs get too close, birds will be frightened away. Birds won't land on Sticky Webbing and will swiftly fly away if they already lands.

When killed, birds drop a Morsel or a Feather, and all other birds nearby will fly away. They are considered innocent creatures and killing them directly adds points to the player's naughtiness level, which causes Krampus to appear. Killing a Crow adds 1 point to the player's naughtiness level, while killing a Redbird or Snowbird adds 2 points to the player's naughtiness level.

Birds take 100 poison damage per interval instead of normal 2. Birds won't land on flooding tiles and will swiftly fly away if they already lands and the flooding spreads.

### Hunting
Birds can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one. They can be Murdered by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel. Birds in the player's inventory can be dropped on the ground and will flop on the ground belly-up for a short while before flying off. They can also be imprisoned in Bird Cages.

Hunting Birds requires a ranged weapon such as a Boomerang. Birds will not land within melee range (even if bait is placed on the ground) and will fly away when the player approaches. However, if they are put to sleep when using characters with a normal damage modifier, they can be killed in 1 hit with a sufficient melee weapon.

If a bird is in flight while in range of a sleeping item's effect, it will plummet to the ground and can be picked up as an item.

### Tips
- When bait-trapping Birds for their Feathers, players should make sure to do so on Turf in which specific Birds will spawn, so that they get specific Feathers. Redbirds and Snowbirds spawn most commonly on Grass Turf, while Crows spawn on Rocky Turf and all player-made turfs.
- If the player doesn't want any Feathers from the Birds, cooking them alive provides a guaranteed Cooked Morsel. Note that this means sacrificing the option of turning the Bird into Small Jerky, since cooked meat cannot be hung on a Drying Rack.
- If the player character has a damage modifier < 1, Boomerangs will not kill birds with one hit, allowing them to flee

The Enlightened Shard is an item exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. One shard can be found when Celestial Champion was defeated. It can also be obtained by using a Deconstruction Staff on an Enlightened Crown, which will drop five shards.

Enlightened Shards can be put into a Mushroom Light, and one shard is enough to make one Mushroom Light to emit the maximum amount of light. The player can mix different colors of Mushroom Spore to make the Mushroom Light emit different colors. A Enlightened Shard will stop the spoilage of other items in the Mushroom Light, making it emit light forever.

Each Enlightened Shard has one inventory slot that will accept one of any color of Mushroom Spore. The color of the spore inside the shard determines the color of light emitted, when placed in Mushroom Lights or dropped on the ground. Any spores inside a shard will not be affected by spoilage, except being inside of the Spore Cloud from Toadstool.

It can be given to Grainy Transmission after defeating Celestial Champion to activate Lunar Rift.

### Trivia

- The Enlightened Shard was introduced in the "Return of Them#Eye of the Storm" update.
- When Enlightened Shard was first introduced in the beta, it could be used to craft back to Enlightened Crown, but this feature got removed later in the beta. It's likely to prevent farming it via the use of Green Gem.
- Prior to the update "From Beyond#Taking Root", the Enlightened Shard was called the "Enlightened Crown Shard" and was only a drop

# Player Speed

Player Speed is a statistic in the game which defines the speed a playable [Character] can move. Most characters have a base movement speed of 6, but some have different movement speeds, and some items and environmental effects can affect the player's movement speed. The effect of items and attachments is calculated by applying a multiplier to base movement speed. If a character has perks or disadvantages that affect movement speed (e.g. [Wolfgang]'s different forms, [WX-78]'s SYSTEM OVERLOAD, or [Wilbur]'s different locomotion methods), any external speed modifier will be applied to the current value.

## Console Commands

In **Don't Starve** and any **DLC**, the player's movement speed can be modified through the following **console command**:

```plaintext
c_speed(value)
```
The "value" parameter has a maximum value of 40 and a minimum value of 1. Note that the speed used here does not correlate to the speed used when **calculating movement speed**.

In **Don't Starve Together**, the player can modify their character's movement speed through the following **console command**:

```plaintext
c_speedmult(multiplier)
```

## Character Base Movement Speed

| Character (Ability) | Base Movement Speed |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| [Wilson] | 6 |
| [Willow] | 6 |
| [Wolfgang] | 6 |
| [Wendy] | 6 |
| [WX-78] | 6 |

| [Warly] | 6 |
| [Wilba] | 6 |
| [Winona] | 6 |
| [Wortox] | 6 |
| [Wurt] | 6 |

## Food/Object Modifiers

There are some items, objects, and foods that when equipped, walked on, or eaten, increase or decrease speed. Many of them can stack, and some are mutually exclusive. See **Calculating Movement Speed** for more information on how they affect a character's speed.

| Object | Effect | Type | Duration |
|--------|--------|------|----------|
| [Thulecite Club] | +10% | Hand Item | While equipped |
| [Magiluminescence] | +20% | Chest Item | 8 min (1 day) |

## Trivia

- Bisque is a smooth and creamy soup of French origin, typically made from lobster, crab, shrimp, or crayfish. It is highly seasoned.
- Wobster Bisque was introduced to Don't Starve Together in the "She Sells Sea Shells" update.
- Despite Winona's examine text for Lobster Bisque, it isn't a Warly-exclusive food.
- Woodie's quote for the dish in DST is changed to "Looks so smooth and creamy, but I'd still prefer salmon." as his original quote referred to the setting of Shipwrecked.

## Description
Dubloons are an **Item** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They are randomly left behind by **Parrot Pirates** (similarly to **Seeds** left by normal **Birds**) or obtained from giving **Trinkets** or **Fishes** to **Yaarctopus**. The loot from the **X Marks the Spot** treasure chests also has a chance to include Dubloons. Using a **Trawl Net** may yield Dubloons, although in **Mild Season** and **Monsoon Season** Dubloons can only be caught in **Medium** and **Deep Ocean**. The **Booty Bag** will also periodically drop Dubloons while equipped, and the **Slot Machine** has a chance to drop them.

## Usage
Dubloons can be spent at the **Slot Machine** for a chance on a variety of rewards. Additionally, they can be refined into **Gold Nuggets** or used by **Woodlegs** to craft his character-specific items.

# Exclusivity: Hamlet

![Interior of The Sterling Trough Deli](The Sterling Trough Deli interior.png)

> A place to purchase goods. - Wickerbottom

## Pig Shops
Pig Shops are naturally spawning Structures exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, where the player can use **Oincs** to buy items. Each shop specializes in a different category of goods. Some Pig Shops can only be found in Swinesbury **Pig City** on the first island, others only in the Palace City on the second island. If the player obtains the **Key to the City**, all Pig Shops becomes craftable in the **City Planning Tab**, except for special buildings such as **Swinesbury Academy** and the **Palace**.

### Interior
Shopkeepers inside of the Pig Shops restock items as soon as the player buys anything. Every morning there is a 16% chance that the item on the pedestal will be replaced. Each item has the same chance of appearing. Items that have been stolen by the player will not be replaced.

Pig Shops are a safe place to hide from **Vampire Bat** waves, Darkness, and **Rain**. When the player is in a shop, there is no loss of **Sanity** from Dusk and Night time. Pig Shops close at **Night**, which means one cannot enter a shop during this period, but if the player is already inside, then they can stay overnight.

Attacking shopkeepers will spawn two **Pig Guards** with Halberds. They will keep attacking the player until they are disposed of and will remain present even if the player leaves and then enters the building again.

### Overview
The following Pig Shops and buildings can be found in Swinesbury:

- **[The Sterling Trough Deli](The Sterling Trough Deli)**: Sells **Crock Pot** foods.
- **[Miss Sow's Floral Arrangements](Miss Sow's Floral Arrangements)**: Sells various **Farming** utensils.
- **[Pigg and Pigglet's General Store](Pigg and Pigglet's General Store)**: Sells **Tools**, **Survival** items, and **Crafting** materials.
- **[Curly Tails Mud Spa](Curly Tails Mud Spa)**: Sells various **Healing** items.
- **[Swinesbury Fine Grocer's](Swinesbury Fine Grocer's)**: Sells various **Food** items.
- **[Swinesbury Mineral Exchange](Swinesbury Mineral Exchange)**: Allows the exchange of Oincs. Sells **Minerals**.
- **[Swinesbury City Hall](Swinesbury City Hall)**: Sells **Housing** permits and **Security Contracts**.
- **[Swinesbury Academy](Swinesbury Academy)**: Buys **Lost Relics** in exchange for Oincs.

The following Pig Shops and buildings can be found in the Palace City:

- **['The Sty' Oddities Emporium]('The Sty' Oddities Emporium)**: Sells rare **Crafting** materials.
- **[The Flying Pig Arcane Shop](The Flying Pig Arcane Shop)**: Sells **Magic** items.
- **[The Boar's Tusk Weapon Shop](The Boar's Tusk Weapon Shop)**: Sells **Weapons** and **Traps**.
- **[The Sow's Ear Hat Shop](The Sow's Ear Hat Shop)**: Sells various **Hats**.
- **[The Tinkerer's Tower](The Tinkerer's Tower)**: Sells **Blueprints**.
- **[Palace](Palace)**: Contains **Queen Malfalfa** and the Royal Gallery.

### Bugs
- Dying in a different world (any of the three DLC realms, as well as **caves**, **ruins**, and the **volcano**) and respawning from a **Meat Effigy** or **Magic Flower** that was placed inside any **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC interior (e.g., **Slanty Shanty**) will cause the player to be respawned out in the void of the world holding the respawn structure. It is recommended to use the command `c_warp("'prefab'")` to teleport the character back into the world, as walking back in can be problematic for world types such as **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**.

### Tips
- Using a **Pan Flute** inside a Pig Shop will cause the shopkeeper to fall asleep, enabling the player to steal goods. Not only will this prevent
