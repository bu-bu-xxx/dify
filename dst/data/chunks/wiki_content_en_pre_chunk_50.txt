# Marsh Camp Guide (concised version) by Jhepong

---

## The Marsh Biome
![Welcome to the Swamp](Attachment:Battle_frenzy1.png "Welcome to the Swamp!!!")
Also known as the Swamp, the marsh is considered the most hostile and inhospitable Biome, and the scariest place a new player can be. Being home to Tentacles, Merms, and Spiders, the Marsh proves to be a common graveyard for the unprepared. Masked by all this danger and by its lack of natural resources, the Marsh is actually a place of abundance, and security from massive and powerful invasions.

## Advantages
These are the advantages of having your base camp in this area:
- Food supply is plentiful even in Winter.
- Provides immediate strategic defense from all creatures, particularly Hounds, Deerclops, Spider Queen, Treeguards, etc., even at the early days of encampment
- The whole region can be your Silk farm, Medicine farm, Fertilizer farm, Reeds farm, and even Tentacle Spike farm!
- and the newest: Beard Hair farm!!!
- "It's more fun and exciting here: no player will get bored and it is splendid for any thrill seekers"

## The Swamp's Golden Rules of Survival
![Respect the Marsh's "Law of Nature](Attachment:Merm_vs_spider2.png "Respect the Marsh's 'Law of Nature'")

"How many times do I need to tell you that it's not a walk in the park."
Now now, why did you die?

"RESISTANCE IS LOOT-ILE." I know seeing all that loot just makes your eyes bulge wide with greed. Remember, it's on the ground for a reason, even if that reason is not immediately apparent, if a Tentacle is the cause of a Merm or Spider's death, you could be dead meat if a Tentacle manages to get you.

"MEAT EFFIGY BEFORE CURIOSITY." Maybe you're the new kid in town, or just an explorer passing by. I care not. But, whoever you are, value your life more than your curiosity.

"TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE KILLS THE RAT." So you're strong and heavily armored; and they don't call you the Deerclops Hunter for nothing. A word of advice: "The swamp bows to no one."

"THOSE WHO ARE YOUR WORST ENEMIES ARE ALSO YOUR BEST FRIENDS." Pretty self-explanatory, those who are the inhabitants of the swamp are extremely deadly, not only to you, but to each other and any other invasions such as the dreaded Deerclops or the giants in Reign Of Giants, always use the inhabitants to your advantage, but be careful they don't take your life in the process.

## Searching for the Right Marsh
If you look in your Map, the brown or mud-colored areas are the Marsh Biomes. They can be randomly allocated in different shapes and sizes, joined or separated by other Biomes, and may also contain narrow streaks or small islands of Forests. They may even be found scattered in different parts of your World.

Hence, what you are really looking for is a large sized Marsh. Though, the secret to finding the best Marsh is actually the one with the greatest number of Rundown Houses. These are single-door hut-like structures where Merms spawn. You can easily find and count them as they are marked in your Map as yellowish hut icons. Do not confuse them with Pig Houses, which are the brownish hut version.

If you see a small Marsh at first, don't give up just yet, as it might be joined to a much bigger Marsh or have a bigger one quite nearby, remember, no world is ever the same.

## Finding the Sweet Spot
Once you have found the right Marsh, you are now ready to find the sweet spot in that vast dangerous area. I suggest that you should wear at least a Grass Suit when exploring the Marshes. The first thing that you need to look for is a Road, which sometimes pass through Forest islands. Next, open your map, and analyze the positions of Rundown Houses. You want to settle at a single spot by the road and surrounded by the most number of Rundown Houses.

If you landed in a pure Marsh Turf area, then that would be just fine. Just be wary of Mosquito Ponds since they spawn Mosquitoes when Dusk arrives. And also, some parts in this area may be heavily infested with Spider Nests and hidden Tentacles. If you found your perfect spot near one or many of these, then you better get rid of them or move further. But during the early days, it is better to just settle at a safe distance from them.

## Safety First
Once you have laid down your basic camp structures for a Base Camp, it is

# Ink Blights

Ink Blights are Shadow Aligned mobs that appear when players approach a Nightmare Fissure with a Dreadstone Outcrop. All Ink Blights possess Planar Entity Protection, reducing the damage dealt to them by regular weapons and thus making Planar Damage weapons more effective.

Looking at the Ink Blights will simply display each of their names as "Ink Blight". However, Characters with their respective Shadow Affinity perks are able to see their real names.

There are two types of Ink Blights groups:

## Jitters, Rasp, and Shriek
They appear in triplicate, always spawning one Shriek, one Rasp, and one Jitters. The Ink Blights will take turns attacking the player in a predictable cycle, with the attack frequency of the remaining Ink Blights increasing as some Ink Blights are killed.

## Three Rictus
Only one stealthy Rictus will attack the player at a time. Once one Rictus is revealed, the second Rictus will appear after some time. A total of three Rictus can spawn.

If all three Ink Blights are killed, the Dreadstone Outcrop will disappear.

## Shriek
- **Health**: 800
- **Damage**: 25 (normal), 30 (planar)
- **Sanity Aura**: -40/min
- **Spawn From**: Dreadstone Outcrop
- **Attack Period**: 4
- **Attack Range**: 8
- **Walk Speed**: 5
- **Drops**: 2-3 Dark Tatters, 2-3 Pure Horror, 1-2 Nightmare Fuel
- **Spawn Code**: "shadowthrall_wings"
- **Shadow Aligned**: 1

Shriek is a hostile creature added to Don't Starve Together. It has 800 health and deals 25 normal damage and 30 Planar Damage. It does not attack at close range, but fires six projectiles towards the player, covering a pentagonal area. If the player is not in the attack radius, then it fires six projectiles in an arc.

## Rasp
- **Health**: 1200
- **Damage**: 20 (normal), 20 (planar)
- **Sanity Aura**: -40/min
- **Spawn From**: Dreadstone Outcrop
- **Attack Period**: 4
- **Attack Range**: 6
- **Walk Speed**: 3
- **Drops**: 3-4 Dark Tatters, 1-2 Pure Horror, 2-3 Nightmare Fuel
- **Spawn Code**: "shadowthrall_horns"
- **Shadow Aligned**: 1

Rasp is a hostile creature added to Don't Starve Together. It has 1200 health and deals 20 normal damage and 20 Planar Damage.

## Jitters
- **Health**: 1000
- **Damage**: 35 (normal), 20 (planar)
- **Sanity Aura**: -40/min
- **Spawn From**: Dreadstone Outcrop
- **Attack Period**: 4
- **Attack Range**: 8
- **Walk Speed**: 4
- **Drops**: 3-4 Dark Tatters, 1-2 Pure Horror, 2-3 Nightmare Fuel
- **Spawn Code**: "shadowthrall_hands"
- **Shadow Aligned**: 1
- **Run Speed**: 8

Jitters is a hostile creature added to Don't Starve Together. It has 1000 health and deals 35 normal damage and 20 Planar Damage.

## Rictus
- **Health**: 800
- **Damage**: Bite: 35, Leap: 15 (normal); Bite: 20, Leap: 10 (planar)
- **Sanity Aura**: -40/min
- **Attack Period**: 4
- **Attack Range**: 4
- **Walk Speed**: 6
- **Drops**: 3-4 Dark Tatters, 1-2 Pure Horror, 2-3 Nightmare Fuel
- **Spawn From**: Dreadstone Outcrop
- **Spawn Code**: "shadowthrall_mouth"
- **Shadow Aligned**: 1

Rictus is a hostile creature added to Don't Starve Together. When the player walks close to the Dreadstone Outcrop, they can only see Rictus's big mouth trying to bite them, seemingly floating mid-air, but they cannot target or hit the Rictus. To uncover its stealth, the player must use an area-of-effect (AOE) attack or an attack that doesn't require selecting

## Dragoon
Dragoons are hostile **Mobs** introduced in the **Shipwrecked** DLC. They spawn from **Dragoon Den**s. They will also hatch from intact **Dragoon Egg**s. When killed, they will drop 2 **Monster Meat**, and have a 25% chance to drop a **Dragoon Heart**.

### Behavior
Dragoons are active during the **day**, and will sleep through the **night**. If they belong to a **Dragoon Den**, they will return to their den at **dusk**. While idle they will periodically spit lava on the ground, which can ignite nearby **Structures** or resources.

They are hostile to the player character and most other Mobs, and will attack them on sight.

When entering combat, they will charge their target and throw a punch. While charging, they leave small flames in their wake, which can ignite items on the ground. Dragoons do not help each other in combat.

### Strategy
Dragoons are relatively easy to kill using melee **weapons**. Players can allow the Dragoon to charge towards them, and then dodge the punch. Striking the Dragoon after dodging its punch stun-locks it for a short period, allowing for the player to land 7-8 weapon hits. However, if they are hit while striking a target, they will not be stun-locked and be free to attack back.

### Trivia
* Dragoons were introduced in the **Wilbur Vs. the Volcano** update.
* The Dragoon's name is a portmanteau of the words "dragon" and "goon" (meaning "thug" or "bully").
* Dragoons have a similar animation to the Catcoon.
*Willow's quote may be a reference to **How To Train Your Dragon**.

- **Spoil**: Does not spoil

## Quotes
- Wilson: A light aflight.

- Wendy: A small light in a dark world.
- WX-78: IT IS RELEASING PHOTONS
- Wickerbottom: A bioluminescent insecta.

A **Glowfly** is a passive **Mob** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It spawns from **Exotic Flower**s. It emits a small radius of light around itself during dusk or night, or in **Deep Rainforest** or **Gas Rainforest**.

Glowflies have a 10% chance to drop a **Light Bulb** when killed. Glowflies can be caught using a **Bug Net**, turning it into an inventory item much like **Bees**. Killing the item form places one Light Bulb in the inventory. Effectively, at the cost of using a Bug Net, a 100% drop chance for a Light Bulb can be guaranteed.

They are affected by a **Bug B'Gone** and will die if they touch the Noxious Cloud.

Unlike most other living creatures that can be kept in the inventory, Glowflies in item form do not have a starvation timer and can be stored forever. Like **Rabbits**, their item form does not stack, requiring an inventory space per Glowfly.

Glowflies are considered innocent creatures. Killing one increases the player's naughtiness by one point, potentially causing **Krampus** to spawn.

Towards the end of the **Temperate Season**, Glowflies start spawning in vastly increased amounts. Usually, this behavior lasts for one to two days. After that, at a certain point, all Glowflies on screen will drop on the ground and form Glowfly Cocoons.

Additionally, **Great Leafy Stalk**s have a chance to spawn Glowfly Cocoons around them. They will do so regardless of the player's proximity to them, similarly to **Puddles**.

Glowfly Cocoons can be attacked. Killing them has a 10% chance to drop a Light Bulb.

After entering **Humid Season** and Glowfly Cocoon is near to player, Glowfly Cocoons hatch into Rabid Beetles.

# Willow

![Willow](Willow.png){: .right width="300px"}

## Beginner/Intermediate Character

Willow is considered a "beginner/intermediate" character due to the nature of her special item, Willow's Lighter. She is designed to assist new players in adapting to the light mechanics in Don't Starve and is the first unlockable character.

## Unlocking Willow

Players who are not familiar with the necessity of gathering logs and cut grass during the first Day-Night Cycle to survive the Grue will be granted access to Willow after surviving a cumulative total of only 8 days as Wilson.

## Experienced Players' Strategy

More experienced players, when planning for a day of scavenging away from their camp, will bring ample logs and cut grass or ensure they have an axe to make a campfire, allowing them to survive the night without relying on Willow's special lighter. However, her lighter is useful for getting back to camp if close enough to make it back without wasting resources.

## Fire Immunity

Willow's immunity to fire damage is negligible at best. The reasons are twofold:

1. When a player stands in fire, there is a built-in 1-2 second delay before damage is calculated, with a visual cue provided by the screen glowing with flames.
2. Fire is not a significant threat for the majority of the game. Spiders, Tentacles, Hounds, and Killer Bees pose greater threats than fire.

## Lightning Strike Advantage

One advantage of her fire immunity is that when lightning strikes near the player in an area with combustible objects, the player won't have to worry about any damage.

## Night Situations

Willow will be most useful when the player is caught in the night with no source of light and no way of making any. These situations are usually circumstantial and apply to newer players who haven't experienced every threat in the game.

## Sanity Management

While playing as Willow, monitor her sanity. If it drops to 60 or below, she might start a fire at her feet, which could burn up any nearby flammable items.

## Advanced Strategy

### Efficient Start

Willow can provide the most efficient start, second only to Wickerbottom, as her lighter allows her to travel at night, scavenge resources, forage for Blue Mushrooms, and gives her an advantage for shaving Beefalo with a Razor.

### Sanity Restoration

Willow can restore sanity by standing next to a fire, even during the night.

### Winter Strategy

During winter, Willow's lighter and immunity to fire allow her to light almost anything on fire and stand right next to it until it burns out, making her less dependent on insulation and better able to explore.

### Combat and Inventory Management

In the base game, Willow can burn flammable items such as logs or grass in her inventory for sanity and warmth. This can be used when fighting, as it can deal fire damage when close to the opponent. Be cautious around flammable objects while using this method.

### Cave Exploration

The lighter allows Willow to survive exploring caves with much less preparation than any other character.

### Lights Out Challenge

For players looking for a challenge in the "Lights Out" preset, Willow's lighter is invaluable. It reduces the constant sanity loss, and the player can take advantage of fires for chopping trees, mining boulders, and gaining sanity.

# Building Land Bases with Other Seasons in Mind

This guide is intended to help players build land bases with the other seasons in mind.

## Part 1: Compacting

The first prep for future seasons happens when you are about to settle down. Once you find a satisfactory island, pick a spot on the coast. Why the coast? Because then you have less to sandbag in order to protect your base. When you place down your first base structure, put it as close to the water as the game will let you. If done properly, you should have a bonus of chests openable from land and water. **DO NOT** do this with your **Fire** pit/**Chiminea**. Otherwise, those structures may be unusable. Instead, place your fire pit/chiminea in the middle of your base. The more you compact, the less flooring and sandbags are required.

## Part 2: Flooring

Why do you need artificial flooring? You need it to prevent puddles from spawning in your base during Monsoon season. You can make a piece of **Wooden Flooring** from one **Board**, and a piece of **Snakeskin Rug** for two **Snakeskin** and one **Cloth**. If your world is connected to RoG and/or Hamlet, you can import crafted **Turfs** from those worlds. **Beard Hair Rug** IS floodproof.

## Part 3: Rainproof Gear

This is the first prep that affects both seasons. A **Snakeskin Hat** and **Snakeskin Jacket**, as well as a **Palm Leaf Hut**, are a must. Wearing both snakeskin attire makes you immune to **Wetness**. The snakeskin also keeps you from being struck by **Lightning**. The palm leaf hut allows you to wear your **Backpack** at home, due to its 100% water resistance. Do not do this as **Webber**, as you cannot also wear the **Shamlet Mask**. Use a **Tar Suit** or **Blubber Suit** instead.

## Part 4: Sandbags

What are sandbags for if you have flooring? Sandbags prevent puddles from spreading, flooring prevents puddles from starting. Sandbags are crafted with two **Cloth** and two **Sand**. One cloth is three **Bamboo**. Either wall yourself in entirely and get out by **Boat**, or make a long and complicated hallway lined with sandbags and with flooring underneath. You may hammer your sandbags during dry season for easier mobility. This will yield sand, but no cloth, forcing you to collect that again.

## What Next?

You've prepared for two of the three major seasons, and you need the time of those seasons to prepare for the fourth, the **Dry** season. What can you do?

### Part 1: Volcano

Find the volcano. It not only houses the **Obsidian Workbench**, which you should always find, but also **Woodleg**'s cage if not already freed, and most importantly the **Volcano Altar of Snackrifice**. If fed the correct items, this structure will delay **Volcanic Eruptions**. The volcano also does not spawn puddles, so it could be an alternative way of dealing with that season. The easiest way to find the volcano is to find the **Rainbow Jellyfish** migration on a new moon and go the opposite way it is.

### Part 2: Fight the Tiger Shark

In the monsoon season, the tiger shark will return to its **Sharkitten Den** and have babies. Why is this important? The tiger shark and **Sharkittens** drop **Shark Gills**, gills make the **Dumbrella**, the dumbrella is like a Shipwrecked **Eyebrella**.

You're done! You should be able to survive one year in Shipwrecked!

# ''Reviewed|Applicable to "Hungry for Your Hunger" update'' Thanks to [[User:Roud72|Roud72]], [[User:Carbon Coded|Carbon Coded]], and Various Wikia Contributors

...and [[User:Coryn02|Coryn02]] this guide is also for you =) "Don't lose hope, we will survive." Detailed Version for New Players (on-going completion) by [[User:Jhepong|Jhepong]]

## I know you've been having a hard time surviving your first couple of days. You've been grinding a lot, gathering resources, [[food]] and spending so much time wandering and learning things, only to die after a few days. Learning all Don't Starve gameplay features through experience is really fun and exciting to most players. Still, there are new players who are starting to feel annoyed and frustrated, and worse, wanting to give up.

Even after reading all those guides and information in the wiki and the forums, still, a few don't seem to grasp the main points of survival in Don't Starve. Maybe they're just used to other easy tutorial included survival games, which are basically city/town building games brushed with a touch of survival for added suspense.

**New players would only realize after a couple of deaths how critical their first few days are in terms of survival in the wilderness.**

**I don't want you to give up Don't Starve. This is one of the Best Survival Games of our time. That's why this is for all that need a more in-depth but leveled help - a comprehensive and detailed guide on your first days of survival from the moment you spawn in your [[World]].**

## A Survival Story

I guess you can call me [[Wilson]], because that's what they call me. I can't even remember if that was my real name, I've been out here that long. They say I'm a great scientist, but the truth is, I'm only good at growing my [[Beard]] into something that looks like an overgrown forest that sprouted over my face. Anyway, here's my story...

### Day One
#### Exploration technique
#### The suitable base camp
#### Things to gather
#### Study your food
#### Flint or Pickaxe
#### The ghost storage
#### <span style="font-size:12px;">Defend yourself</span>
#### Fight or flee
#### Night time chores

I woke up in some place, with a [[Maxwell (NPC)|strange man]] talking nonsense to me. Suddenly, he just disappeared. The place looked nice, with lots of [[saplings]], [[grass]], [[evergreen]] trees, [[berry bush]]es, [[carrots]], some [[flint]], [[flowers]], [[Ponds|frog ponds]], [[bees]] and their [[Bee Hive|bee hives]]. I think they call that the [[Grassland]] [[Biome]], and it was such a wonderful place. But I did not let myself be taken by the sight. I knew that was a dangerous world. Time moved here for every step I make and for all the [[food]] I eat. Soon I will starve if I don't find something to eat. [[Hounds]] and [[monsters]] would try to feed on me. Then the [[Night Monster]] will take me if don't have a light source at [[Night]]. And, to add to my already difficult situation, [[Winter]] started on Day 21, so I should have prepared myself then, right?

**But how would I prepare? What should I have done?**

**"Time is of the essence."** Now where did I hear that? Well, someone told me a ''lo​ng'' time ago that I should do things the right way at the right time. That I must conserve precious time, but still not forget about my [[Hunger]], [[Health]] and [[Sanity]], before the very first [[Winter]] arrives. I guess they were right.

So I started gathering all the food and resources I managed to find in this biome. And after looting the Grassland dry, I immediately started my exploration to find the best spot for a [[Guides/Base Camp Guide|Base Camp]].

The first step I took was walking in one straight direction until I arrive at the island's edge, which I want to call the "sea cliff" because it touches the [[ocean]]. Someone taught me this kind of exploration a long time ago. This is very useful because it will give me an idea of the boundaries of my [[World]] when I open my [[map]].

Standing by the sea cliff, I really had no idea where to head to. But following what I learned, the next step is to trail the sea cliff in one direction. Doing such will give me ample knowledge on how my [[World]] looks like: its size

### Behavior
Pogs are neutral Mobs exclusive to the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. These curious and hungry critters tend to spawn in small herds in the Wild Plains Biomes. A Pog drops a single Morsel when killed. They are considered innocent creatures and killing one adds 2 points to the player's Naughtiness level, which can cause Krampus to appear.

They will eat any Food Item left on the ground (including buried Mandrakes, but not poisonous food such as Tubers and Poison Dartfrog Legs). They will also attack small creatures in the world like Butterflies, Glowflies, Pikos or Peagawks, and eat their edible loot, leaving anything non-edible behind for the player to collect.

The player may feed them any food item to make them a companion for a short amount of time. Unlike Pigs, Pogs value quantity over quality when offered food, meaning Meaty Stew offers as much Pog loyalty as Seeds. Gaining a Pog following can be helpful as they will fight aggressive mobs, distracting them and even defeating smaller mobs such as Rabid Beetles, Weevoles, and Poison Dartfrogs. A befriended Pog will follow the player into buildings and beg at food displays in Pig Shops.

If brought back to a base, Pogs, like Splumonkeys, will open Chests, Ice Boxes, (inactive) Crock Pots, Scaled Chests and Root Trunks, throwing aside items in search of food to eat. They cannot open Cork Barrels, however, and if the player cooks items in a Crock Pot, a Pog will be distracted from ransacking the base for a period of time, but the best way to stop this behavior is to lead them away from the base or kill them.

### Aporkalypse
During the Aporkalypse, Pog will turn hostile and attack all non-Pog entities. In addition, corrupted Pogs can no longer be befriended until the Aporkalypse is dealt with.

### Trivia
- According to Wickerbottom, the scientific name of the Pog is Otocyon Canis. This breaks the rules of the binomial nomenclature, as it is a combination of two genera. The Otocyon genus refers to the bat-eared fox, whereas Canis is the genus containing dogs, wolves, etc.
- According to Rhymes with Play #213, the word "Pog" is not a portmanteau for anything. (The truth is, it's the word "Dog" with an attempt to make it a cuter word by starting with a "P" instead of a "D

# Finding the Right Biome for Your Base

Finding a good biome to put your main base in can be difficult. Each biome has its pros and cons. This guide is meant to help the player decide which biome would be best for their personal needs by listing each pro and con.

## Savanna

The **savanna** biome can be identified by its yellow **turf**. Savanna biomes are commonly large, though can also be quite small. There are a range of pros and cons in the savanna biome. It is always a good idea to at least settle near a savanna biome, if possible, as they can be used for a range of materials, as well as protection against **hound**s and **Boss Monsters**.

### Overview

There is a quite a lot of **Cut Grass|grass** throughout the savanna biome. Enough so that the player will almost always have a supply on hand, even if they just set up nearby a savanna, especially if the savanna is larger. Grass can be used for **rope**, **trap**s, **Campfire|fires**, **Torch|torches**, and **Backpack|backpacks**, among many other things.

![A screenshot featuring a savanna with beefalo in it.](Savanna Land.png)

**Beefalo** also spawn in savannas, with a more frequent chance to spawn in the larger savannas. They come in herds of various sizes. They can be used as protection against hounds, as well as various **Boss Monsters**. As hounds will eventually lose interest in the player and attack other mobs, and all beefalo in the area will attack a monster that attacks one of them, it is easy to use them against **Hounds**. This is also true for any monster with an area of effect attack, such as the **Deerclops**. However, beware that tougher monsters with this AoE attack may be able to overpower and kill beefalo. Beefalo also occasionally drop **manure**, which can be used to make and fertilize **farms**, as well as fertilize certain **plants**. Beefalo can also be shaved, using a **razor**, for **Beefalo Wool|beefalo wool**, which can be used to make **Winter Hat|winter hats**, along with some other things. Beefalo will also go into mating season during **spring** (Or randomly, if **Reign of Giants** is not installed.) When in mating season, they will attack anything and everything, including the player. However, if the player is wearing a **Beefalo Hat**, they will not get attacked.

**Rabbits** are very frequent. They can be captured with **trap**s, and killed for **morsel**s. The live ones can also be used to make a **prestihatitator** and **Rabbit Earmuffs|earmuffs**. If the player is insane then they turn into **beardlings**, which can be killed for **Beard Hair|beard hair**, **monster meat** or **Nightmare Fuel|nightmare fuel**. During **Autumn**, **Summer**, and **Winter**, they can be used as a great food source. In **Spring**, however, their holes are closed up and they will not come out unless their hole is dug up, which will permanently get rid of the hole.

**Spider**s will rarely spawn in savannas, but on the occasion that they do spawn, they can be used to obtain **Spider Gland|spider glands**, which are a healing item, **monster meat**, which can be used as a crockpot filler or be eaten at a cost to the player, and **silk**, which can be used for **Sewing Kit|sewing kits**, **tent**s, **Top Hat|top hats**, and many other things. Spiders are easily killed and many even spawn a **Spider Queen|spider queen** which can be killed to the player's benefit.

**Tree**s and **Sapling|saplings** do not spawn in savanna biomes, posing a disadvantage to the player as they are both extremely important to survival. However, the player can dig up saplings and plant them in the savanna. Unlike many plants, they do not require **Fertilizers|fertilizer**. Trees can be planted using **Pine Cone|pinecones** or **birchnut**s. They do also not require fertilizer, so it is at little cost to the player.

Food sources like **Berry bush|berry bushes** also do not spawn in the savanna. This is yet another disadvantage, as berry bushes, **carrot**s, and other food sources can be eaten or used in the

## Recipe

**Crock Pot:**
- 2x Leafy Meats
- 2x Sweetener
- **Result:** Jelly Salad

## Examples

1. **Crock Pot:**
   - 2x Leafy Meats
   - 2x Honey
   - **Result:** Jelly Salad

2. **Crock Pot:**
   - 2x Leafy Meats
   - 1x Royal Jelly
   - 1x Twigs
   - **Result:** Jelly Salad

3. **Crock Pot:**
   - 3x Leafy Meats
   - 1x Royal Jelly
   - **Result:** Jelly Salad

## Tips

- This is a great food for Wigfrid players, since it restores a large amount of Sanity, and Wigfrid cannot eat Cooked Green Caps.
- If the player has developed a Leafy Meat farm through the use of Meat Bulb (Lureplant) on a boat and has access to Bee farms, the player can consistently restore their sanity easily.
- The player can use Mushroom Planters to farm Green Caps, which when eaten raw will drop the players sanity by 50 points at once. Combined with the 50 sanity gain from eating Jelly Salad, this allows the player to quickly manipulate their sanity at will.

## Trivia

- Jelly Salad was introduced in the Troubled Waters update.

# Survival Guide: Hamlet DLC for Don't Starve

This is a survival guide written for players starting out in the **Hamlet** DLC, which deviates in some aspects from the formula shared by the other DLCs in addition to adding many new features. This guide is for features and strategies exclusive to **Hamlet**. For players who have not played Don't Starve before, see [this guide](https://example.com/Guides/Getting Started Guide). This guide only covers the first few days of the DLC.

## Day 1

The first thing you will notice after waking up is your spawn point. Similar to **Shipwrecked**, the pieces of debris around you can be hammered for resources. More importantly, however, is a **machete** on the floor. This machete is vital to your survival, as the **Tall Grass** must be harvested with it. Begin harvesting **Saplings** as you would normally, and hack at the tall grass with your machete. Flip **Stone Slabs** to obtain flint for tools. You should also try to collect as many **exotic flowers** as you can find, as you can feed the pigs of the cities with those and earn money from collecting their **manure** - as they eat them (drop the flowers on the ground and let them feast, one at a time).

Your first priorities should be a **Pickaxe** and a **Torch**, and if you have any spare flint, an **Axe**. Try to avoid straying into the **Deep Rainforest** for now, and instead search for a **Cave Cleft**. Inside, there is likely to be at least one **Stalagmite**, which you should mine for more flint, rocks, and a gold nugget.

Back on the surface, make a **Science Machine**, a **Hammer**, and **shears**. Build yourself some essentials, such as a **Log Suit**, a **Spear**, and a **Backpack**. If you still have flint to spare, think about making a spare machete so that you won't run out of grass. Once you're done building everything, hammer the science machine and keep exploring.

## Day 2

Today should be spent exploring, as well as revisiting your spawn point to hammer the debris around it. Of specific note are the **Deflated Balloon** and the **Monogrammed Luggage**, for a free piece of cloth and a razor. If you come across the **Painted** **Biome**, explore it and pick up any gold and iron on the ground, while keeping a safe distance from **Gnat Swarms**. If you come across the **Cultivated** Biome, make a note of it and keep exploring. Also, if you find a **Peagawk** near the edge of the map you can try and run it into a corner. The feathers can be made into a gas mask or traded.

## Day 3

Today, it's time to head into the city proper. Head through the cultivated biome and look for the slated turf and aristocratic pigmen. The pig civilization uses **Oincs** as currency, and traders will give you oincs in return for certain items. The items they accept can be determined by their appearance. The best way to make money early on is to use your shears to trim **Hedges** for **clippings**, which can be exchanged with the **blond-haired pig** in return for one oinc apiece with no cool-down. The razor can also trim hedges but the shears are better since they give twice as much. Another fairly efficient way of making money is to give refined goods, such as rope which can be farmed by killing hanging vines, to the **mechanic pig**. However, most traders only accept goods once a day, so it's important that you look for duplicate types of traders if you want to make a lot of money fast.

Once you've gotten about 50 oincs, look for **Swinesbury City Hall**. In here, you can buy the **Deed of home ownership** to give yourself a safe haven: the **Slanty Shanty**, however it can be bad if you have more experience because it is far from important biomes, so I'd recommend making a base outside near important biomes like the **Lily Pond** biome. If you haven't found it already, the deed can be read like a **Message in a Bottle** to reveal the location of the house. Inside the house, you are completely protected from darkness. The first time you enter, put your Deed on the shelf or on the floor, as you no longer need it to access the house. Inside will be two pieces of charcoal on the floor, as well as a c

# Reign of Giants Cave Base Guide for Summer Survival

## Why Build?

In Reign of Giants, Summer can be exceptionally hostile due to several reasons:

- **Smoldering**: Structures risk catching fire.
- **Overheating**: Players can quickly overheat and take damage.
- **Dragonfly**: The summer giant is extremely difficult to handle.
- **Red Hounds**: They spawn during Hound waves and can set structures on fire.

A cave base can mitigate these issues:

- Reduced heat means no smoldering.
- No giants in caves.
- No Hound waves in caves.
- Easier to defend against Depths Worms compared to above-ground threats.

## Preparation

### Finding the Right Cave

- Choose a Plugged Sinkhole close to your year-round base for quick access.

### Preparing the Entrance

- Install a light source and build a Hound trap near the entrance.

### Pre-building Structures

优先级从高到低，以下结构是洞穴基地必备的：

1. **Endothermic Fire Pit**: Essential for survival in summer.
2. **Birdcage**: Renews seed and egg supply, converts Monster Meat into Fresh Eggs.
3. **Crock Pot**: Converts Monster Meat into edible food.
4. **Ice Flingomatic**: One is needed to keep crops hydrated.
5. **Endothermic Fire**: Prototype this if not pre-built.
6. **Improved Farm**: Set up to four with a stack of Manure.
7. **Ice Box**: Cools Thermal Stones and prevents food spoilage.
8. **Fire Pit**: Used for cooking during summer.
9. **Siesta Lean-to**: Restores sanity and cools off.
10. **Thermal Measurer**: Indicates when summer ends.
11. **Meat Effigy**: Highly recommended.
12. **Alchemy Engine**: If prototyping craftables at the cave base.
13. **Drying Rack** (optional): Useful for making Jerky.
14. **Pig House** (optional): Renewable source of Meat.

### Items to Bring

- Stack of Cut Grass and Twigs for building.
- Healing items like Healing Salve, Honey Poultice, or Jerky.
- Stack of Seeds for farming.
- Nitre for building Endothermic Fires.
- A Bird for the Birdcage.
- Walking Cane for mobility.
- Portable Light Source like a Miner Hat or Torches.
- Tam o' Shanter for sanity.
- Protection like a Log Suit and Tentacle Spike.
- Two Thermal Stones for temperature management.
- Fuel like Boards or Beefalo Wool.
- Hound's Teeth for crafting Sewing Kits.
- Food that doesn't spoil quickly.
- Manure for Improved Farms.
- Tools for resource collection.
- A Backpack, Piggyback, or Krampus Sack for carrying resources.

## Location

When selecting a location for your main base:

- Ensure it's safe and quick to access from the entrance.
- Be close to food sources and Light Bulb sources.
- Choose a shaft of natural light to minimize lighting needs.
- Provide natural protection from threats and an emergency escape route.
- Avoid locations too close to Rabbit Hutches.

## Setup

### Base Camp

Set up essential structures: Birdcage, Endothermic Fire Pit, Crock Pot, Ice Box, and Thermal Measurer. Place your Bird in the Birdcage and perishable items in the Ice Box.

### Resources

Collect resources like Flint, Rocks, Green Mushrooms, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Berry Bushes, Guano, and Light Bulbs. Replant crops within range of your Ice Flingomatic. Watch for Spider Dens and collect Monster Meat and Silk.

### Farm

Place your Ice Flingomatic in a light shaft and set up Farms, Berry Bushes, and Crops. Fertilize with Guano, Rot, and Manure. Set up a Tree farm around a light shaft and manage Treeguards.

### Protection

Create a Rock Lobster pen with enough Rocks to deal with Depths Worm waves.

## Upkeep

### Managing Hunger

- Primary food source initially is Meatballs cooked in a Crock Pot.
- Harvest Monster Meat from Depths Worms and Spiders.
- Earthquakes can provide Morsel from falling Rabbits and Moleworms.
- Harvest Berries during the Day to spawn Gobblers for Drumsticks.
- Eels can be fished from Ruins ponds if needed.

### Managing Sanity

- Monitor Sanity due to constant drain in caves.
- Use Siesta Lean-to, Cooked Green Caps, Tam o' Shanter, and Jerky to maintain Sanity.

### Managing Temperature

- Use Thermal Stones in a Backpack or Piggyback to "supercool" next to an Endothermic Fire.

The Village biome is found in the Ruins. It was once the residential area of the Ancient's civilization. Splumonkeys are frequently found in the area, along with numerous Cave Banana Trees. Much of the area around the crumbling buildings resembles the Wilds, and the occasional Pond, Light Flower, and Lichen can be found.

The crumbling buildings are denoted by blocks of light and dark Runic Turf, and within, both intact and broken Relics can be found.

# Gnarwail

### Exclusivity to Don't Starve Together
The Gnarwail is a neutral **Mob** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**.

### Structure Info
- **Health:** 1000
- **Diet:** **Meat**
- **Damage:** 50
- **Walk Speed:** 1.875
- **Run Speed:** 5 (10 dive)
- **Spawn From:** 
- **Drops:** ×4 **Raw Fish**, **Gnarwail Horn**

### Quotes
- **Wilson:** My, what a big horn you have.
- **Willow:** Geez, look at the nose on that thing!
- **Wolfgang:** Big fish think it can poke holes in Wolfgang's boat?!
- **Wendy:** I cannot escape its piercing gaze... or horn.
- **WX-78:** DON'T YOU DARE POKE YOUR NOSE AROUND HERE
- **Wickerbottom:** It appears to be a variation of the Monodon monoceros.
- **Woodie:** That thing looks like it could do some damage.
- **Maxwell:** Perhaps it could be reasoned with.
- **Wigfrid:** Draw your weapon and fight me, beastie!
- **Webber:** Woah, it's got a spear on its head!
- **Winona:** Yeesh, uh... nice whale?
- **Warly:** Mon dieu, don't skewer me!
- **Wortox:** Now now, no need to put a dent in my dinghy.
- **Wormwood:** Pointy head
- **Wurt:** You a weird looking fish, florp.
- **Walter:** Unicorns of the sea.
- **Wanda:** Another obviously made-up creature.

### Behavior
Gnarwails are neutral toward players and are sometimes seen noding. They chase and eat other **Ocean Fishes**. When attacked, they drill **Boats** with their Horn, damaging them and creating leaks. The Horn can be attacked and destroyed without killing the Gnarwail, dropping one **Gnarwail Horn**. If a Gnarwail doesn't have a horn, it will attack by jumping into their targets, creating **Waves** in the ocean. They attack anything that isn't located on a boat with their jump attack only.

Gnarwails can be befriended by giving them **Meats**. They follow for 25 **Hunger** per day for up to 2.5 days. Follower Gnarwails will regularly toss **Items** floating in the **Ocean** towards the player.

When not hunting ocean fish, Gnarwails attack Monsters that come too close, including **Cookie Cutters**, **Malbatrosses**, **Skittersquids**, and **Rockjaws** with their jump attack.

During **night**, they sleep unless provoked or already in combat.

Gnarwails will despawn if the player travels far away enough such that they are unloaded from the player's vicinity.

### Trivia
* Gnarwails were introduced in the **Hook, Line, and Inker** update.
* When a Gnarwail does its jump attack, an E-Guitar can be heard.
* Even though they are neutral animals, they are considered hostile mobs in the game files and attacked by Malbatrosses.
* Its name may be a pun on Narwal and Gnarly, given its rock guitar aesthetic, in addition to wail, as in the wail of a guitar.
* As stated by Wickerbottom, the Gnarwail is a variation of **Monodon monoceros**, which is the common narwhal in real life.
* Like the Whales in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**, Gnarwails drop Raw Fish, despite themselves being marine mammals.

## Introduction

The hostile world of Don't Starve becomes even more dangerous with the addition of boss enemies. This guide is designed to assist newer players in combat against these formidable foes.

## Deerclops

### Regular Don't Starve

Deerclops, the original boss of Don't Starve, is encountered during Winter and poses a significant threat to your Structures. If you choose to engage, be prepared for a challenging fight.

### Wilson

Wilson, with his average attributes, can deal with Deerclops through kiting, utilizing a Campfire and a Spear for combat.

### Willow

Willow, with her lower health, should avoid tanking and instead start a forest fire to kite Deerclops in the flames.

### Wolfgang

Wolfgang can defeat Deerclops easily with a full stomach, using just a Spear and staying warm by a fire.

### WX-78

WX-78 does not need armor or sanity items if fully upgraded, but kiting is recommended otherwise.

### Wickerbottom

Wickerbottom should bring On Tentacles to distract Deerclops and kiting is advised due to her low sanity regeneration.

### Wendy

Wendy should rely on kiting and use Abigail as a distraction if necessary.

### Woodie

Woodie can transform into the Werebeaver to sustain his transformation and kill Deerclops or choose to kite as a human.

### Maxwell

Maxwell, with his low health, should avoid Deerclops and summon Puppets to lower his health and sanity, making him weaker.

### Non-direct methods

Recruit Pigs, Bunnymen, or set Tooth Traps as alternate combat methods against Deerclops.

## Reign of Giants and Don't Starve Together

Deerclops gains new abilities in Reign of Giants, including the power to freeze his foes. The general strategy remains the same, but certain characters like Maxwell face increased danger.

## Bearger

Bearger, the giant of Autumn, is passive but dangerous, seeking food and breaking structures. He is considered one of the best axes in the game due to his ability to knock down trees.

### General

Bring healing items and spare weapons to combat Bearger.

### Wilson

Wilson can whittle, kite, or tank against Bearger, using powerful armor and healing items.

### Willow

Willow can use fire to stay sane and deal damage, kiting in the flames.

### Wolfgang

Wolfgang can use his Mighty Form's damage buff with Darts and kiting is effective.

### WX-78

WX-78 can rely on gears for healing if fully upgraded.

### Wickerbottom

# Lunar Hail

![Lunar Hail Settings Icon](Lunar_Hail_Settings_Icon.png)

**Lunar Hail** is a weather phenomenon exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**.

## Spawns
- ![Moon Shard](Moon_Shard.png)
- ![Infused Moon Shard](Infused_Moon_Shard.png)

![Willow under Lunar Hail](Willow_under_Lunar_Hail.gif)

Once **Lunar Rifts** are activated, hail will periodically start falling in the form of **Moon Shards** and **Infused Moon Shards**. When they collide with the ground, they have a 25% chance to not break, but they only remain for 5 seconds, unlike resources that fall from **Earthquakes** in the Caves. If one of these falling objects hits a player, it deals 30 damage. Wearing armor reduces this damage as normal.

## Damage Prevention
A few things fully prevent damage from Lunar Hail:
- Standing under any **Tree**
- Equipping a **Hardwood Hat** crafted by **Woodie** with the Hat Carving **insight** unlocked
- Equipping an **Umbralla** in hand
- Wearing **Bone Armor** (on its normal 5 second cooldown)

And these things prevent the hail from falling in the area at all:
- The Umbralla activated on the ground
- The canopy of a **Great Tree Trunk** or **Above-Average Tree Trunk**

Lunar Hail happens every 10 days and lasts up to 90 seconds. Unlike regular **Rain**, these hail storms do not cause **Wetness**. If it is raining when a hail storm starts, the rain is overridden.

## Trivia
- Lunar Hail was introduced in the **Host of Horrors** update.
- On initial beta release prior to Update 575729, Lunar Hail would happen every 2 days and last up to 60 seconds.
- Beta update 576473 removed the hail's ability to damage creatures other than the player; the developers still intend to make it do this when they "expand on this feature along with a proper set of mechanics for protecting creatures."

# Mushrooms

There are three different types of **Mushrooms**. Some **Mushrooms** give extra sanity/health when eaten.

## Red Mushroom
**Red Mushrooms** can be found in **Grassland** or **Forest** biomes and can be easily identified by their red cap. They are only harvestable during **Day** time, during **night** and **dusk** they will bury themselves underground.

![Red Mushrooms during Daytime](Red 'shrooms.jpg)

## Green Mushroom
**Green Mushrooms** can be found in **Forests**, **Savannas**, and **Marshes** and can be easily identified by their green caps. They are only harvestable during **Dusk**; during **Day** and **Night** they will bury themselves underground.

![Green Mushrooms during Dusk](Green 'shrooms.jpg)

## Blue Mushroom
**Blue Mushrooms** can be found in **Forests** and **Marshes** and can be easily identified by their blue caps. They are only harvestable during **Night**; during **Day** and **Dusk** they will bury themselves underground.

![Blue Mushrooms during Night](Blue 'shrooms.jpg)

A buried mushroom cannot be harvested like normal but it can be dug up using the **Shovel**. Digging up a buried mushroom will produce 2 Caps of the respective mushroom but it will also prevent more mushrooms from growing. If not dug up, a mushroom will regrow shortly after the next **Rain**.

## Mushtrees
**Mushtrees** are organisms that can only be found in **Caves** or during the full moon on the surface in **Reign of Giants**. Mushtrees are, as their name indicates, a mixture between **Mushrooms** and **Trees**. Unlike "normal" mushrooms, Mushtrees cannot be picked or dug up, they have to be chopped down with an **Axe**. Upon being chopped they will drop the respective loot depending on which kind of Mushtree it was. Just like the mushrooms there are three types of Mushtrees; **Red Mushtree**, **Green Mushtree**, and **Blue Mushtree**. When a Mushtree is set on fire, it will burn to a crisp and then disappear dropping one **Ash** and one **Charcoal**. In addition to that all mushtrees provide light.

### Red Mushtree
After being chopped down the Red Mushtree will drop one **Log** and one **Red Cap**.

### Green Mushtree
After being chopped down the Green Mushtree will drop one **Log** and one **Green Cap**.

### Blue Mushtree
The Blue Mushtree is the biggest Mushtree and will drop two **logs** and one **Blue Cap**.

| Mushtrees in-game |
|-------------------|
| ![Red Mushtree](MushtreeRed.png) | Red Mushtree |
| ![Green Mushtree](MushtreeGreen.png) | Green Mushtree |
| ![Blue Mushtree](Mushtree.png) | Blue Mushtree |

## Usage
Each mushroom has a positive and negative effect on all the characters, amounts depend on if it is cooked or not. Mushrooms are treated as vegetables and as such they fit in any recipe that requires them.

Examples:
- Ratatouille: 4 Mushrooms
- Butter Muffin: Butterfly Wings, Mushrooms, Twigs

The **Collector** is a [Pig Trader](Pig%20Traders) [Mob](Mob) exclusive to the [Don't Starve: Hamlet](Don't%20Starve:%20Hamlet) DLC. He is a pig in a trench coat who buys various animal loot and trinkets for three [Oinc](Oinc)s. There is no limit to the amount trades done in a day.

* **Drops**: [Meat](Meat) 75%, [Pig Skin](Pig%20Skin) 25%

One Collector may spawn from a [Town House](Town%20House), and will wander randomly around their house and eat any edible items left on the ground, including [Pig Skin](Pig%20Skin). Every so often they will drop one [Manure](Manure) where they are standing, and if the player picks up that manure the Collector will approach them and give them one [Oinc](Oinc), along with an accompanying quote.
