## Overview
Dragonpie is a Fruit Food item cooked in the Crock Pot by using 1 Dragon Fruit and other fillers. It takes 40 seconds to cook. Adding any Meats will result in Meatballs or other meat-based recipes. Adding a Mandrake will result in Mandrake Soup. Adding 3 Sweeteners will result in Taffy. Adding more than 1 Durian will result in Monster Lasagna unless Twigs are also added. Adding an Eggplant and another Vegetable may result in Stuffed Eggplant. Adding Banana could result in a Banana Shake.

As it is not a meat food item, Wigfrid will not eat it.

## Downloadable Content
In all DLCs, Dragonpie increases the player's perceived temperature by 1 degree per second for 10 seconds when consumed. The same is true for Don't Starve Together.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, adding Banana, Ice, and Twig as fillers will result in Banana Pop instead.

In the Hamlet DLC, Dragonpie can be bought for 30 Oincs at The Sterling Trough Deli, making it the most expensive food from the shop.

## Spawning
The Tiger Shark can spawn in any season, triggered by certain player actions while on the ocean (in a boat). These actions and their season dependent chance to spawn Tiger Shark is summarized in the table below. When it spawns, unless it is near the den, it will be passive towards the player; this frequently results in it not being seen at all. Once reduced to 10% health, it will retreat towards the den. If it gets too far away, it despawns. After despawning, it cannot spawn again (either by actions or by approaching the Sharkitten Den during Monsoon season) for a certain amount of time. If it dies by any means, it cannot spawn again for 10 days, despite the current season.

| Action | Mild | Hurricane | Monsoon | Dry |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|-----|
| Respawn Time | 7 days | 5 days | 3 days | 10 days |
| Fishing Rod Fishing | 1% | 1% | 2% | 1% |
| Fishing Rod Reeling | 1% | 1% | 2% | 1% |
| Fishing Rod Catching | 1% | 1% | 2% | 1% |
| Spear Attacking | 0% | 1% | 2% | 0% |
| Sea Trap Baiting | 1% | 3% | 6% | 1% |
| Bug Net Netting | 1% | 3% | 6% | 1% |
| Meatballs Eating | 0% | 3% | 6% | 0% |
| Riding a wave | 0% | 1% | 5% | 0% |

## Behavior
Every now and then, the Tiger Shark will give some Bile-Covered Slop to its Sharkittens.

The Tiger Shark will not attack small creatures, the player or Packim Baggims if they stay away from its den. However, it will attack everything else like Wildbore, Spiders, Snakes, Sea Hounds, etc. on sight. It might be a good idea to bait these to the Tiger Shark if the player is having troubles with them. If playing as Wendy, the Tiger Shark will also attack Abigail while ignoring Wendy unless she attacks it first.

When fighting on land, the Tiger Shark will run directly towards its targets and will try to bite them, which will deal area damage. It will also use a ground pound attack if its target is too far, that will also destroy structures. The impact place is easy to spot as it makes a huge shadow on the ground. This attack is also used when the Tiger Shark goes from water to land.

# Walani

![Walani](Walani.png)

- **Health**: 120
- **Hunger**: 200
- **Sanity**: 200
- **Start Item**: [[Surfboard]]
- **Hunger Multiplier**: -1.2×
- **Sanity Multiplier**: -0.9× and +0.9×
- **Wetness Multiplier**: -1.2×
- **Spawn Code**: "walani"
- **Links**: [[Walani Quotes]] | [[Walani Clothes]]

## Surfboard

Walani starts with a Surfboard, which has ×1.3 the sailing speed of a [[Raft]] but only ×0.66 the durability. The Surfboard can be stored in the [[Inventory|inventory]] and crafted with 1 [[Boards]] and 2 [[Seashell]]s from the [[Nautical Tab]].

![Walani Surfing](Walani_special.png)

Walani can ride on Big [[Waves]] with her Surfboard, gaining 1 {{sanity}} and a ×5 (Small Waves) or ×7 (Big Waves) speed boost for a short time. She dries off from [[Wetness]] 20% faster and her Sanity changes 10% slower over time, excluding instantaneous changes. Walani does not have a sanity drain from [[Wetness]] itself, but has a drain from [[Wet]] [[Items]].

### Disadvantage

Walani has lower maximum Health and her Hunger drains 20% faster. Her Surfboard's limited durability can be an issue, and her Sanity drains and fills slower compared to other characters.

## Prototype Tips

- Walani starts with her Surfboard, so no need to gather materials for a [[Log Raft]] or [[Raft]].
- Boards can be acquired without a [[Science Machine]] by using a [[Hammer]] on [[Crate]]s in [[Beach|Beach Biomes]].
- Walani can hold [[Torch]]es while surfing, easing early exploration.
- A [[Captain Hat]] delays the loss of normal boat durability, and a [[Pirate Hat]] reveals more of the map while surfing.
- The Surfboard can only be hammered when deployed onto water but does not drop crafting materials.
- A [[Cargo Boat]] with a [[Cloth Sail]] matches the Surfboard's speed, but an [[Armoured Boat]] is faster, not counting wave riding speed.
- Surfing on Waves in the [[Ocean]] biomes is an easy way to restore Sanity.
- [[Purple Grouper]] and [[Tropical Bouillabaisse]] can be used to replicate the Surfboard's speed and sanity benefits in any direction.
- A [[Sea Yard]] is useful to keep Surfboards repaired, as [[Boat Repair Kits]] are inefficient on the Surfboard.

# Monsoon Season (Shipwrecked)

"The water is too rough!" - Wilson

## Overview
Monsoon Season, also known as Green Season, is a Season in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is equivalent to Spring. Monsoon Season is indicated with the world having a bluish-green tint. By default, it begins on day 37 and ends on day 58. During Monsoon Season, nights gradually become shorter with days becoming longer. Dusk stays longer.

## Wormwood Blooming
Wormwood will start to bloom during this season.

## Rain and Flooding
Rain during Monsoon Season causes patches of land to be flooded. The first days of monsoon seasons are relatively rain-free. However, as the season progresses, rain becomes more frequent and flooding worsens until most of the land is flooded during the end of the season. Lightning, while present, is less frequent than during Hurricane Season and Strong Winds do not occur. Frequent rain means Crops, Grass, Twigs, and other pickable plants will grow 33% faster.

## Enemy Chase and Tree Growth
Maximum chase time and range for enemies is increased by 33%. Trees take 25% less time to grow to the next stage.

## Flooding Management
The rains in Monsoon Season come in waves. Each wave will increase the size of the puddle that will flood the areas. Using Sandbags can permanently remove a puddle when done properly (see [Sandbags](Sandbags) and [Flooding](Flooding) for more information). Certain structures will no longer function when in a puddle. This includes but is not limited to iceboxes, crockpots, alchemy engine, and prestihatitator.

## Staying Dry
If the player must venture into flooded zones, an [Umbrella] combined with a hat with a water resistance rating such as a [Top Hat] or [Football Helmet] will prevent the player from getting wet. [Snakeskin Jackets] and [Snakeskin Hats] are good and cheap solutions to combat Wetness if no high-end gear were found from [X Marks the Spot] treasure chests. [Blubber Suits] and [Tar Suits] are perhaps the best gear because they completely make the player immune to Wetness, however they do not protect from lightning strikes.

## New Threats
[Poison Mosquitoes] start to appear during Monsoon Season spawning in the flooded areas. [Lureplants] will also begin to spawn in this season, rendering player-made flooring very effective to combat both puddles and Lureplants.

## Bees and Crabbits
Like in Spring, normal [Bees] become aggressive towards the player. [Crabbit Den]s collapse within the first days of this season. However, the [Sharkitten Den] opens up and a chance of [Tiger Shark] to spawn is the highest.

## Fishing
[Trawl Net] fishing yields as much catch as during [Mild Season].

## Transition to Dry Season
Monsoon Season is followed by [Dry Season]. The long-term goal of Monsoon Season is to prepare for Dry Season in advance. It is more easily done within the first half of the season where flooding is not much of an issue and rains are not very frequent.

# Things

Things are pieces used to build a portal to the next world. Each Thing has a designated [Set Pieces] that will spawn with it. There are five different pieces, and as such, 5 different Structures.

![Things are widely dispersed around the world.](Things_are_dispersed.png "Things are widely dispersed around the world.")

Things will tend to spawn with large distances separating them, and as such will encourage the player to explore the world to find all of them. A [Divining Rod] can help locate Things. One is given to the player in [Adventure Mode], or can be crafted.

Things can't be stolen by [Krampus] or [Splumonkey]s and won't be eaten by [Eyeplant]s.

# Grasslands Biome

## Overview
Grasslands are common biomes found in the world, generally safe areas with many types of useful resources. Players always spawn in a Grassland upon entry to a world, whether it be a small, zigzagged patch of green or a whole biome.

## Characteristics
- **Abundant Resources:**
  - Evergreen
  - Grass Tuft
  - Sapling
  - Flower
  - Carrot
  - Crow
  - Redbird
  - Birchnut Tree (Reign of Giants)
- **Occasional Resources:**
  - Berry Bush
  - Blue Mushroom
  - Red Mushroom
  - Green Mushroom
  - Beehive
  - Killer Bee Hive
  - Pond
  - Rabbit Hole
  - Fireflies
  - Mini Glacier (Reign of Giants)
  - Burrow (Reign of Giants)
- **Rare Resources:**
  - Mandrake Planted
  - Spider Den
  - Walrus Camp
  - Sinkhole
  - Worm Hole

## Terrain and Flora
Grasslands are characterized by their green Grass Turf and scattered Evergreens, Grass Tufts, Sapslings, Carrots, Flowers, and Berry Bushes. Flint can also be found on the ground occasionally.

### Fauna
Beehives and Pig Villages are commonly found on Grassland terrain. Rabbit holes appear sparsely in Grasslands, as do Ponds which spawn Frogs. Butterflies are commonly found here due to the abundant Flowers.

## Dangers
The primary dangers in Grasslands are Spider Dens, which are typically spread out, and Killer Bee Hives, which can sometimes be found in dense formations along with regular Beehives and many Flowers. Walrus Camps are also more likely to spawn here than in any other biome, creating a hazard in Winter.

> "Rocks will be ours!" - Webber

## Description
Rockyland is a biome characterized by an abundance of Boulders (both normal and gold vein versions) and Mini Glaciers, with a combination of Rocky Turf and barren turf. It is one of the native habitats of Tallbirds and their Nests, with up to four or five Nests in the biome. Crows are the only bird species that spawn here.

Rockylands have few plants, but occasional Evergreen Trees, Saplings, or Grass Tufts may be found on the edges.

Rarely, a branch of this biome infested with Spider Dens may be encountered, making travel dangerous. Gold Nuggets can also be found on the ground in this biome branch, making it a good, albeit risky, place to obtain gold for crafting a Science Machine.

## Planting Restrictions
Berry Bushes, Saplings, Grass Tufts, Spiky Bushes, and Evergreens cannot be planted on Rocky Turf. It must first be removed with a Pitchfork to plant. This turf can be combined with 1 Boards to produce Cobblestones, which are placeable Roads.

## Usage
Forest Turf can be used to plant various plants such as Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Lureplants, Pine Cones, and Birchnuts. It also does not stop the Lureplants' Eyeplants from spawning.

When placed on the Surface World in a large enough area, birds like Crows and Redbirds will start to spawn and land on these turfs. During Winter, Redbirds are replaced by Snowbirds.

## Tips
Players with very low Sanity may not be able to see Shadow Creatures on Forest Turf at dusk or night. This is especially true if one has been digging up many Graves, as they are typically found in Forests.

# Lunar Island

**Exclusive to Don't Starve Together**, the **Lunar Island** is a unique area introduced in **Return of Them**. It's a remote island originating from a chunk of the **Moon** (specifically, the **Alter**), located far out into the **Ocean** and accessible only by **Boat**, **Woodie**'s Weregoose form, or rarely, the **Telelocator Staff**'s random teleport. The island's arrival has increased the sea level of the Ocean near **The Constant**'s mainland in **Don't Starve Together**.

## Overview

When players step onto the island, a special effect replaces their **Sanity** with an **Enlightenment** meter. This meter rises at the same rate as Sanity decreases outside the island.

The Lunar Island consists of five different **Biomes**:

- **Rocky Beach**: Inhabited by **Anenemies** and contains **Reeds** or **Shattered Spider Holes**.
- **Lunar Archipelago**: Composed of small islands with **Sea Bones** and **Driftwood**.
- **Lunar Forest**: Mainly comprised of **Lune Trees** with some **Shattered Spider Holes**.
- **Lunar Baths**: Full of **Saladmanders** and **Stone Fruit Bushes**.
- **Lunar Mine**: Contains **Boulders**, **Moon Glass**, multiple **Celestial Fissures**, and **Inviting Formations**.

**Gestalts** are commonly found on the island. **Hounds** killed on the Lunar Island have a chance to become **Horror Hounds**. Aggressive **Moonrock Pengulls** will spawn during **Winter**, similar to normal **Pengulls** on the mainland.

## Tips

- To find the Lunar Island, look for several explored biomes forming a large bay or 'C' shape around open water. The location of the island tries to turn that 'C' into an 'O'.
- There are no **Sea Stacks** or deep water on the shortest routes between the main island and the Lunar Island.
- Woodie's **Weregoose** form is a great option for finding the Lunar Island, but avoid transforming back to Woodie over water.
- When playing as **Wortox**, planting **Flowers** at the Lunar Island and farming **Butterflies** for their drops is a good way to keep Wortox fed and lower Enlightenment.
- Utilizing the Lunar Baths, the island is a good place to set up camp in Winter, as the nights are long, keeping Enlightenment low. Hot Springs provide heat to combat freezing and light when **Bath Bombed**, but be aware of the Moon Cycle.
- **Wolfgang** can do well on the Lunar Island due to faster sanity drain. **Maxwell** struggles due to constant sanity regeneration, while **Walter** can keep his sanity/enlightenment at a fixed level.

## Trivia

- The Lunar Island was introduced in the **Turn of Tides** update.
- The island is a piece of **The Constant**'s moon that broke off and fell into the Ocean. This event is shown in the release trailer for **Turn Of Tides**.
- Rarely, the Lunar Island will spawn so close to the land that **Wortox**'s normal soul hop can reach it.

# Tropical Bouillabaisse
Tropical Bouillabaisse is a **Crock Pot** dish introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is made from a **Purple Grouper**, a **Neon Quattro**, a **Pierrot Fish**, and **Vegetables**, with a total **value** of 1.0. The cooked versions of the fish are also valid.

### Quotes

- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang does not know what to call this."
- Wendy: "A brief respite from the hunger."
- WX-78: "THIS WILL FUEL MY SUPERIOR MECHANICAL BODY"
- Wickerbottom: "An inventive twist on a traditional Marseille dish."
- Woodie: "It's a bit fishy."
- Maxwell: "Hm... Needs more fish."
- Wagstaff: "A delicious concoction of water borne animals!"
- Wigfrid: "Tis a fish feast!"
- Webber: "Mmm! Tastes like food!"
- Walani: "Eating a lot cures the desert island blues."
- Warly: "Such a decadent dish!"
- Woodlegs: "Tis a'hearty fish soup!"
- Wilba: "‘TIS NUM NUMS O’ FANCY STUFFS"
- Wormwood: "Glub Glubs?"
- Wheeler: "The fins are still in there. Just the way I like it."
- Choose: Wickerbottom

### Prerequisites
- Requires: **Purple Grouper**
- Requires: **Neon Quattro**
- Requires: **Pierrot Fish**
- Requires: **Vegetable**

### Recipe
| Item 1    | Item 2     | Item 3     | Item 4   | Tool  | Result          |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Purple Groupers | Neon Quattros | Pierrot Fishes | Vegetables | Crock Pot | Tropical Bouillabaisse |

### Examples
| Item 1     | Item 2     | Item 3     | Item 4     | Tool  | Result          |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Purple Grouper | Neon Quattro | Pierrot Fish | Seaweed | Crock Pot | Tropical Bouillabaisse |

### Tips
- The speed increase from Tropical Bouillabaisse will stack with **Coffee** for even greater **speed**.
- The protection from wetness and boat damage granted by this dish also allows the player to receive a speed boost regardless of which direction the player hits waves. Not only does it help greatly when dealing with the **Quacken**, **Sealnado**, **Tiger Shark**, and **Whale**s, but it also makes the **Encrusted Boat** an extremely speedy vessel especially during hurricane season when waves are prolific.
- While **Wigfrid** refuses to eat **Coffee** because it is not a **Meat** item, she is still able to eat Tropical Bouillabaisse to gain a small movement speed boost.

### Trivia
- Tropical Bouillabaisse was added to the **Shipwrecked** DLC more than a year after its official completion in the **Home Sea Home** update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.
- The code suggests that Tropical Bouillabaisse was originally intended to have two separate speed increases, one for land, and one for sea

- **Willow**: "I like him."
- **Wolfgang**: "He is like ringmaster, but more birdy."
- **WX-78**: "A FLYING MINION MIGHT BE USEFUL"
- **Wickerbottom**: "He's a rather curious character."
- **Woodie**: "There's just somethin' about him I don't trust..."
- **Maxwell**: "Just look at him, strutting around like he owns the place."

- **Wurt**: "Ooooh, is fancy Birdfolk."
- **Walter**: "Woah! A real bird man!"
- **Wanda**: "Hello there, Goodfeather. How long has it been?"

## Corvus Goodfeather's Role
The **Corvus Goodfeather** allows the player to access items in [Cawnival Creation Filter](#) while standing close to him. The filter only has the [Cawnival Sapling](#) initially. After purchasing the Cawnival Sapling, the rest of the filter becomes available. The players can purchase [Cawnival Token](#)s and [Cawnival Games](#) that are only available in this event.

Corvus is marked out on the map similarly to mobs like [Chester](#). When the player is playing a minigame, he will watch and comment on the player when they are playing the game well. Once the minigame ends, depending on how well the player did, he will give the player extra [Prize Tickets](#).

# Crawling Horror

![Crawling Horror](File:Crawling Horror.png){width=100px}

- **Health**: 300
- **Damage**: 20
- **Drops**: 1-2 Nightmare Fuel
- **Attack Period**: 2.5
- **Attack Range**: 3
- **Run Speed**: 3
- **Sanity Aura**: -100
- **Spawns From**: Nightmare Light, Ancient Statue, Ancient Statue Head, Low Brain

**Spawn Code**: "crawlinghorror" "crawlingnightmare"

**Special Ability**: Teleports when attacked

The **Crawling Horror** is a large tick-like Shadow Creature with many legs. It is the most common type of Shadow Creature. When the player's Sanity is above 15%, Crawling Horrors will wander around and move away from the player when approached, while also occasionally teleporting around the player's vicinity. Crawling Horrors become aggressive when the player's Sanity drops below 15%, and their Sanity aura will further decrease the player's Sanity by -100/min. A Crawling Horror will telegraph its aggression by standing upright and baring its teeth while producing a shifting, warping growl. Crawling Nightmares produce the same growl, but with an increased echo and distortion. This audio cue is also used when the Crawling Horror/Nightmare attacks.

## Crawling Nightmares

**Crawling Nightmares** are a version of Crawling Horrors encountered in the Ruins (and sometimes in regular Caves). Crawling Nightmares spawn from Nightmare Lights/Fissures, and are aggressive regardless of Sanity level.

The Crawling Horror has a slower movement speed than the player and can easily be outrun in order to avoid confrontation. If outrun by a great distance, Crawling Nightmares will return to the Nightmare Light or Nightmare Fissure they spawned from. Crawling Horrors, on the other hand, will just materialize closer to the player, as long as their sanity remains low enough.

Crawling Horrors, if spawned in while insane, show off a "pathfinding" behavior. They will stop this behavior once aggro is drawn. Crawling Horrors drop Nightmare Fuel and restore Sanity by 15 points when killed. Crawling Nightmares will drop fuel but will not restore Sanity.

## Fighting Strategy

Crawling Horrors, Terrorbeaks, and Swimming Horrors can be attacked if they are actively pursuing the player. Despite their intimidating appearance, individually they are very easy to fight: the basic tactic is to kite them, by walking close enough for them to attack, dodging the attack by walking back, then hitting them. Since they teleport away when damaged, the player won't be able to hit them more than once. However, they will occasionally pause to perform a "yelling" animation, during which it is possible to get one extra hit in without them teleporting, for a maximum of two hits. It is possible for them to teleport within melee range, allowing the player to land a second hit simply by holding the attack button (F by default).

While multiple Crawling Horrors are easy to deal with, a player with incredibly low sanity may have to fend off one or more Terrorbeaks alongside them. If this occurs, it is better to simply run and make distance in order to fight Terrorbeaks individually, due to their sheer speed.

Since they are only visible to the player, mobs cannot be recruited to defend against Shadow Creatures. However, there is an exception in Willow's Bernie, which is the only Mob in the game that's able to taunt Shadow Creatures and attack them.

Tornadoes spawned by the Weather Pain can stop a Shadow Creature's teleports due to its fast and continuous attacks. It is very useful for stopping a group of them during the Nightmare Cycle.

| Weapon | No. of hits for Crawling Horror |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Fire Dart | 71 |
| Fire Staff | 23 |
| Tooth Trap | 18 |
| Old Bell | 12 |
| Fishing Rod | 10 |
| Bug Net | 9 |
| Lucy the Axe | 8 |
| ... | ... |

## Downloadable Content

In the Hamlet DLC, Crawling Horrors and Terrorbeaks can chase the player through Lily Pond Biomes, attacking along with Swimming Horror. Also, Crawling Nightmares and Nightmarebeaks can spawn when non-Nightmarefuel items are given to the End's Well. Those spawned at End's Well are the same as in the Ruin, restoring no Sanity.

## Description
Trail Mix is a Fruit Food item introduced in the Reign of Giants DLC. It is cooked in a Crock Pot by combining 1 Roasted Birchnut, 1 Berry, and 1 Fruit.

### Stats

- **Hunger Restored**: 12.5
- **Sanity Restored**: 5

### Recipe
- **Roasted Birchnut**: x1
- **Berry**: x1

### Healing Benefits
Trail Mix is one of the cheapest healing dishes that can be made, restoring more Health than its components, making it a useful early game healing item. However, it restores less total Hunger than its individual ingredients, even for Walter.

### For Beefalo
Trail Mix is one of the better healing items for Beefalo, for whom it restores 120 health (due to their 4x food health multiplier). It can be made earlier in the game than Dragonpie and lasts longer than Beefalo Treats (15 days vs. 10).

- **Perk**: Throw-able, can be picked back up
- **Dropped By**: ![White Whale](34) ![X Marks The Spot](34)
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "harpoon"

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "I don't intend to harp on the issue."
- **Willow**: "Just need something to throw it at."
- **Wolfgang**: "Even Wolfgang's throws is mighty!"
- **Wendy**: "It brings naught but death."
- **WX-78**: "FLESHLINGS ARE WEAK TO SHARP FLUNG OBJECTS"

- **Wilba**: "ARMS WILBA FOR A SEA OF TROUBLES"
- **Wormwood**: "Throwy stick"
- **Wheeler**: "Looks like my pitching arm is going to come in handy."
- **Choose**: WX-78

The **Harpoon** is a ranged **Weapon** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It can be obtained from an exploding **White Whale** Carcass or can be found in **X Marks the Spot** treasure chests. When this weapon is used to attack, it will be thrown by the player and deal 200 damage upon hitting the target. The Harpoon will land next to its target and can be picked up.

## Prototype Tips
- Character damage modifiers apply to the Harpoon’s damage:
  - **Wolfgang** deals 250-400 damage in Mighty Form and is able to kill **Wildbores** in 1 shot at 225 hunger, **Dragoons** and **Crawling** and **Swimming Horrors** at 250 hunger, **Werepigs** at 275 hunger, and **Elephant Cacti** and **Terrorbeaks** at 300 hunger. It takes 2 shots to kill **Water Beefalo** at 225 hunger, **Blue Whales** at 263 hunger and **White Whales** at 300 hunger.
  - **Wigfrid** deals 250 damage and can kill Wildbores in 1 hit and Water Beefalo in 2.
  - **Wendy** and **Wes** only deal 150 damage but it is enough to kill **Crocodogs** and **Sea Hounds** in 1 shot.
- A Harpoon can be used to destroy **Beehives** in a single shot, which does not give a chance for the **Bees** to defend their home.
- **Elephant Cacti** take two hits from a Harpoon to destroy. With 10 uses, each Harpoon allows gathering 5 Elephant Cacti. Although there are much cheaper alternatives (such as burning rope next to the cacti or dodging the AOE needles, attacking with melee while wearing a log suit that can be crafted into a cactus armor when durability gets low, etc.) this is a quick and easy way to collecting Elephant Cacti.

## Placeholder Trivia
- The Harpoon can be seen stabbed in the **White Whale**'s head, which may be a reference to the novel **Moby-Dick**.

Cave Rock Turf is one of the [Turf](Turf) [Items](Items), acquired by digging Cave Rock Turf tiles with a [Pitchfork](Pitchfork). Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as [Fuel](Fire#Fuel).

Similar in appearance to the [Rocky Turf](Rocky Turf), the Cave Rock Turf is often found on [Stalagmite Terrain](Stalagmite Terrain) and in [Rocky Plains](Rocky Plains). The difference between Rocky Turf and Cave Rock Turf is that Cave Rock Turf has more cracks along its surface, and more importantly, Cave Rock Turf is unable to be crafted into [Cobblestones](Cobblestones).

[Berry Bushes](Berry Bushes), [Grass Tufts](Grass Tufts), [Saplings](Saplings), [Spiky Bushes](Spiky Bush), [Pine Cones](Pine Cone), [Birchnuts](Birchnut), and [Lureplants](Lureplants) cannot be placed on Cave Rock turf, and Eyeplants will not grow on it. Crows are the only [Birds](Birds) that will land on Cave Rock turf.

Cave Rock Turf has the second highest overlap priority of any turf in the game, meaning it will almost always appear "on top" when overlapping adjacent turfs. The only turf with a higher overlap priority is [Mud Turf](Mud Turf).

If brought to SW, [Floods](Flooding) can spawn on this turf.

# Knockback (Don't Starve Together)

**Knockback** is a unique stat exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. This attribute can be associated with an attack and is currently only available to the player character.

## Types of Knockback

- **Large Knockback**: Pushes the player back for some distance, requiring extra time to stand up. Can cause the player to fall off the **Beefalo**. <!--Need to confirm-->
- **Small Knockback**: Pushes the player back for some distance. <!--Need to confirm-->

Wearing **Marble Suit** or **Commander's Helm** can convert a Large Knockback into a Small Knockback, which doesn't cause extra durability loss. **Woodie's** wereform is immune to Small knockbacks and cannot be knocked down by Large knockbacks.

## Description
'''Savanna Turf''' is one of the [[Turf]] [[items]], acquired by digging [[Savanna]] tiles with a [[Pitchfork]]. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile, or it can be used as [[Fire#Fuel|fuel]].

Plants like [[Berry Bush]]es, [[Grass Tuft]]s, [[Saplings]], [[Spiky Bush]]es, [[Lureplant]]s, [[Pine Cone]]s, and [[Birchnut]]s can be planted on these Turfs. It will not also stop the Lureplants' [[Eyeplant]]s from spawning.

When placed on the [[Surface World]] and the area is large enough, [[Birds]] like Crows and Redbirds will start to spawn and land on these turfs. During [[Winter]] Redbirds are replaced by Snowbirds.

When brought to SW, [[Flooding|Floods]] can spawn on this turf.

# Crop Seeds

Crop Seeds are a specialized version of [Seeds](Seeds/DST), used primarily for [Farming](Farm Plant). In *Don't Starve Together*, Crop Seeds have different visuals but they have the same functionality as in *Don't Starve*. Initially, Crop Seeds have an assumed name related to their shape. Once the player has accumulated enough knowledge by researching the [Farm Plant](Farm Plant) with a [Gardeneer Hat](Gardeneer Hat), their name changes to the regular name.

They are obtained by harvesting [Farm Plant](Farm Plant)s, by hammering [Giant Vegetables](Giant Vegetables) or by feeding a Farm Plant crop to a [Birdcage](Birdcage). The Birdcage drops 1 seed per crop. The [Lord of the Fruit Flies](Lord of the Fruit Flies) drops 4 to 8 plant seeds upon death.

There is a 33% chance that [Carrat](Carrat)s will drop [Carrot](Carrot) Seeds upon death. [Durian](Durian), [Eggplant](Eggplant), [Pumpkin](Pumpkin), [Onion](Onion), [Garlic](Garlic) and [Pepper](Pepper) seeds can be obtained by trading with a [King of the Merms](King of the Merms).

When eaten, Crop Seeds provide 0.5 [Health](Health) and 9.375 [Hunger](Hunger). Like regular Seeds, Crop Seeds spoil in 40 days, and they turn into [Toasted Seeds](Toasted Seeds) when cooked.

The [Seed Pack-It](Seed Pack-It) will slow spoilage of any contained seeds by 50%.

## Description
Fungal Turfs are Turf items acquired by digging Fungal Turf tiles with a Pitchfork. Like other Turfs, they can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as fuel. They are only found in caves and come in three different colors: blue, red, and green. Variants of Mushtrees and Mushrooms can be found on these Turfs and they cover the ground of a Mushtree Forest. Plants like Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Lureplants, Pine Cones, and Birchnuts can be planted on all types of Fungal Turfs. Green and red will prevent Eyeplants from spawning when transplanted on the surface, while blue will not. All types of Fungal Turf, when placed on the Surface World in an area large enough, will only allow Crows to spawn on the turf. In SW, floods can spawn on this turf.

## Trivia
- Currently, red and green fungal turfs are referred to as the standard "Fungal Turf".

This page lists [Quotes] by [Wes]. When Wes examines something, he will perform random pantomimes. There are no specific actions for any one mob or item. The player can alt-click items and objects to examine them.

### Unused

| ![Wes mime2 unused.gif](Wes mime2 unused.gif) |

## Trivia

- Wes will still say "I can't do that" when attempting to do an impossible action (this is corrected in Don't Starve Together).
- Wes's original pantomime movements were animated by Alex Savin. [Alex Savin on Tumblr](http://alexsavin.tumblr.com/post/95278309045/): "Wes the Mime! Because he didn’t have any dialog strings in the game I animated these loop-able actions that he uses instead!" Posted on August 20, 2014.
- During the preview stream for [A Little Rain Must Fall](http://archive.li/OfRbm), developers said that Wes has an invisible bicycle, a likely reference to his cycling action.
- Additional pantomimes were added to DST for Wes's refresh update.
- According to Rhymes with Play #279, the pantomime in which Wes waves both his hands is based on the American Sign Language (ASL) sign for applause.
- The pantomime in which Wes puts a hand to his forehead and looks around is recycled from an animation for the Crabby Hermit.
- Wes is the only character without an actual quote.
- In Don't Starve Together's A Little Drama and QOL update, the game files include dialogue strings for Wes's soliloquy. These are never seen normally in-game since he is coded never to access dialogue strings. The text is in French, and translates to "Are you trying to understand my thoughts? How kind of you! I am flattered. :)"

# Warbucks

## Character Information

- **Name**: Warbucks
- **Image**: ![Warbucks](Warbucks.png)
- **Start Items**: 
  - ![Magnifying Glass](Magnifying Glass)
  - ![Ball Pein Hammer](Ball Pein Hammer)
- **Health**: 150
- **Hunger**: 120
- **Sanity**: 200
- **Spawn Code**: "warbucks"
- **Links**:
  - [Quotes](Warbucks quotes)
  - [Clothes](Warbucks clothes)
- **Sanity Multiplier**: -15 per food not prepared in a Crock Pot.

Warbucks gained **sanity** over time when he held **Oincs**. He gained, in a non-linear way, up to 40 **sanity** per minute if there was up to 200 Oincs in the player's inventory. Holding more than 200 Oincs did not increase his Sanity regeneration further. He also started the game with a **Ball Pein Hammer** and **Magnifying Glass**.

Because he was an explorer, his experience with treasure hunting tools allowed him to only consume half of what is normally consumed for the **Ball Pein Hammer**, **Magnifying Glass**, **Disarming Tools**, and **Gold Pan**.

## Sanity Regeneration Table

| Oincs in inventory | Sanity per minute |
|--------------------|------------------|
| 0-9                | 0                |
| 10-19              | 6.25             |
| 20-49              | 12.5             |
| 50-199             | 25               |
| 200 and more       | 40               |

## Disadvantages

Warbucks lost 15 **sanity** every time he ate **Food** not prepared in a **Crock Pot**.

## Tips for the Prototype

- Making Crock Pot dishes is difficult at the beginning of the game. When coupled with Warbucks' low maximum **Hunger**, the player was in danger of either starving or going insane quickly from eating raw food. Spending the first few days clearing the **Deep Rainforest** to collect the **Lost Relics** there, and then visiting **Pig City** gave the player enough Tenpiece Oincs to easily survive before a Crock Pot was made.
- Warbucks' ability to regain Sanity by holding Oincs in the inventory allowed him to manage it easily if the player had sufficient Oincs on hand. This was arguably even more useful than **Maxwell's** ability, as the player could have chosen to stop the sanity regeneration at any time, and control the rate at which it happened.
  - The downside was that this was a mid-game advantage since he started with no Oincs.

**Mud Turf** is one of the **Turf** items, acquired by digging Mud Turf tiles with a **Pitchfork**. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile, or it can be used as **fuel**.

Mud Turf can only be found in **Caves**. It is one of the two Turfs that connect or surround the **Sunken Forest**.

Plants like **Berry Bush**es, **Grass Tuft**s, **Saplings**, **Spiky Bush**es, **Lureplant**s, **Pine Cone**s, and **Birchnut**s can be planted on these Turfs, and **Eyeplants** will spawn normally from a Lureplant. Crows are the only **Birds** that will spawn and land on Mud Turf.

When taken to SW, **Floods** can spawn on this turf.

Mud Turf has the highest overlap priority of any turf in the game, meaning it will always appear "on top" when overlapping adjacent turfs.

- When a creature or player dies within 20 units of Wortox, they will drop a [[Soul]] – [[Webber]] will drop two Souls, [[WX-78]] drops none, and [[Giant]]s will drop 7-8. Souls vanish after 10 seconds, but can be picked up by Wortox. Souls have four uses:
  - They can be eaten, restoring +25 {{hunger}} but costing -5 {{sanity}}.
  - They can be released to heal Wortox and nearby allies in a AOE, and give Wortox small amount of sanity.
  - They can be used to "Soul Hop" (teleport) a short distance away, functioning identically to [[The Lazy Explorer]], before going on cooldown. Wortox can teleport twice in a row between cooldowns, if he is quick enough.
  - They can be used to teleport to any explored location on the map, costing up to 20 depending on distance.
- Negative [[Sanity]] effects from monsters are 0.5x effective on Wortox.
- Wortox's favourite food are [[Pomegranate]]s, raw and cooked, which restore an additional +15 {{hunger}} than usual. However, his food penalty still applies to them.

## Disadvantages
- Wortox's body craves Souls above all else, reducing the effects of other [[Foods]] by 0.5x; This applies to both positive and negative effects, however, meaning that Wortox loses less [[Health]] and/or Sanity from consuming foods like raw [[Meat]].
- Wortox can only hold up to 20 Souls, stating when he is nearly at his limit. If Wortox collects any more Souls, he will drop 10.
- Since Wortox is a demon, [[Pig]]s, [[Catcoon]]s, and [[Bunnymen]] are hostile towards him and will attack on sight.

## Prototype Tips
- To easily farm Souls, players can keep a few [[Flower]]s around their base and kill the [[Butterfly|Butterflies]] that spawn.
  - This method also allows the player to easily regain sanity by catching, planting, and picking Butterflies.
  - Other easy moveable mob spawners are spidernests & beehives.
- Because he's invincible while Soul Hopping, Wortox can use his Soul Hop ability to easily kite large mobs such as [[Deerclops]] and [[Bearger|Bearger.]] Players can simply attack until the opponent is about to attack back, then Soul Hop while the enemy is attacking.
- Wortox can release Souls he has captured after a fight to heal himself and his allies.
- Wortox can be extremely powerful when paired with a [[Wickerbottom]], as reading [[Books#Birds of the World|Birds of the World]] and [[Books#Sleepytime Stories|Sleepytime Stories]] in quick succession can result in many Souls captured.
  - He also works well with a [[Wolfgang]], as Wolfgang can easily destroy enemies for souls and Wortox can leave all of the physical food for Wolfgang.
- In a PvP server, killing a Wortox will result in all of his Souls being released.
  - This can used to the player's personal advantage, targeting Wortox so they can heal themselves after he is killed.
- Wortox's [[Don't Starve Together#Favorite Food|favorite food]] is both raw and cooked [[Pomegranate]], meaning he gains 2.8125 / 1.25 bonus {{Hunger}} when consuming the food despite his usual aversion to normal foods.

# Wheeler Character Information

![Wheeler](Wheeler.png)

### Stats
- **Health**: 100
- **Hunger**: 150
- **Sanity**: 200
- **Starting Items**: Pew-matic Horn, Navigadget
- **Speed**: 1.05× up to 1.17×

### Links
- [Wheeler Quotes](Wheeler quotes)
- [Wheeler Clothes](Wheeler clothes)

### Abilities
Wheeler starts with the **Pew-matic Horn**, which can shoot certain items to damage mobs, and the **Navigadget**, which directs the player to the nearest chosen item by placing the desired item into it. For example, placing **Twigs** within it will guide the player to the nearest pickable **Sapling**.

Wheeler's base movement speed is 5% higher compared to other characters and increases by 1% for every empty inventory slot. Items inside of backpacks are ignored, allowing her to move faster as long as all of her items are in a backpack and not in her main inventory.

She can also perform an action called "Dodge", which allows her to move swiftly over a short distance. The ability needs to recharge (1.5 seconds) before the player is able to do it again. During the dodge animation, Wheeler is completely invulnerable from all forms of physical damage, although any armor equipped will still be affected.

### Disadvantages
- Wheeler only has 12 inventory slots compared to 15 for other characters.
- Lower maximum health of 100.

### Tips
- Correct use of Dodge ability can enable Wheeler to be extremely proficient in close-quarters combat.
- Wheeler's Dodge ability and fast movement allows her to explore more efficiently.
- Wheeler's Dodge ability is very useful in fighting Spider Warriors and Boss Monsters.
- Wheeler's speed movement can stack with the Walking Cane or Stalking Stick, Magiluminescence, and the Sleek Hat to have a total increase of up to 67% movement speed while both items are worn.
- As a ranged weapon, Pew-matic Horn can be used to easily kill mobs that run away from the player.
- In the base game, Reign of Giants or Shipwrecked worlds, putting Boards inside the Navigadget allows the player to easily find the Wicker Basket.

The **Poison Mosquito** is a hostile Mob in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It is a yellow and purple colored version of the normal Mosquito, and its attacks Poison the target. It has a 50% chance to drop a Yellow Mosquito Sack and a 25% chance to drop a Venom Gland.

Poison Mosquitoes spawn either in Monsoon Season from Flooded tiles or via a bad outcome of the Slot Machine. Like Mosquitoes, they are fast-moving and can be caught with a Bug Net. They have a small yellow blood sac which grows with each successful attack. On the fourth successful attack, the Poison Mosquito will explode and cause additional damage to its surroundings.

### Prototype Tips
- A Seashell Suit or a Horned Helmet will prevent the player from being poisoned by the Mosquitoes.

### Trivia
- Unlike normal Mosquitoes which spawn from Ponds in the Marsh, the Poison Mosquitoes do not spawn from Tidal Pools in the Tidal Marsh.

> "These pigs have questionable taste in architecture." - Willow

## Description
A **Pig Village** is a settlement of **Pigs** and 5-9 **Pig Houses**, sometimes with a **Pig King** who's surrounded by **Obelisks**. Sometimes there are **Carrots**, **Flowers**, **Grass Tufts**, and **Berry Bushes** in farms of nine, fewer if the amount of those plants (other than Flowers) has been tweaked for **Sandbox Mode**. Some villages may also spawn with **Merm Heads**.

## Spawn Locations
Pig Villages usually spawn in a **Grassland** biome close to a **Forest** biome, though they rarely spawn in other biomes such as **Rockyland** or **Savanna**. A **Cobblestone** **Road** will usually lead to a Pig Village but there is a chance that it might not.

| World Size | Number of Villages |
|------------|--------------------|
| Default    | 1-3                |
| Medium     | 1-3                |
| Large      | 2-3                |
| Huge       | 2-5                |

## Other Associated Structures
* In the **Caves**, there is a special type of house (**Rabbit Hutch**) that **Bunnymen** live in.
* In **Marsh** biome, the Pig Houses and the Pigs are replaced with **Rundown Houses** and **Merm**s.
