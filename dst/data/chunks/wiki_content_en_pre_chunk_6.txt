## Description
Honeycombs are acquired by destroying Bee Hives and Killer Bee Hives, unless burned down (which yields Ashes).

Honeycombs are mainly used to build Bee Boxes and craft Beeswax, but can also be used in Taffy, Pumpkin Cookie, and Ice Cream recipes as a substitute for Honey or as a neutral filler in any other Crock Pot recipes. However, Honeycomb itself cannot be eaten.

The ideal time to get it from Bee Hives is right before Dusk when most or all bees are outside collecting pollen. The only ones that defend the hive are still inside until the player fights back, and one or two bees can be safely ignored with protective gear. Since Killer Bees don't leave their nest to collect pollen, there is no opportune time to attack a Killer Bee Hive, except for leading other mobs like Deerclops into them, to access its honeycomb.

Another option is luring them away by proceeding to run in large circles to keep them a fair distance. Since they are far slower than the player it becomes an easy task (even more so if there is a Road surrounding the nest). Then run back, destroy the hive and take the prize.

## Downloadable Content
In the Hamlet DLC honeycomb can be acquired by hammering down Antcomb Homes that are found within the rooms of Mant Hills.

**Skeletons** are the remains of other unknown adventurers who perished before the main character entered the world. They can occasionally be found in the wilderness, usually around [[Set Piece]]s, and often have random loot beside them. Skeletons can be struck with a [[Hammer]] to produce 2 [[Bone Shards]].

When defeated, a [[Big Tentacle]] can drop one.

Only 100 skeletons can exist in the world at one time, and any new ones generated after will vanish and leave [[Ashes|ash]] behind.

=={{Pic32|Gift Icon}} Downloadable Content==

In all DLCs, when the player dies, an identical skeleton with a special character [[Character quotes|examination quote]] will be left in that location with the player's items, implying that all set pieces are dead players. When examining their own skeleton, characters will say the following:

=={{pic|32|Placeholder}} Trivia==

* The model of the Skeleton is the same model as the unimplemented character [[Unimplemented Characters#Wilton|Wilton]] found in the ''[[Don't Starve]]'' files.
* The word 'Boon' means 'Favor' and given that skeletons make up the majority of boons, it's likely that this is a pun on the word "Bones".
* There is a type of skeleton in ''Don't Starve Together'' that appears to have a [[Spear]] stuck in it, though when hammered, it does not drop a [[Spear]].
* Before the ''[[Don't Starve/Version History|Quality of Life]]'' update, skeletons couldn't be struck with a Hammer to produce 2 Bone Shards in the base game.

## Behavior

Beefalo exhibit unique behaviors, such as forming herds and having mating seasons which affect their temperament and actions.

### Herds

Beefalo herds have a "home" location and tend to sleep closely packed together at night. Herds with less than four members may merge with others, and mating seasons significantly impact their behavior.

### Mating Season

Beefalo in heat are effectively hostile, targeting any nearby mob, player, or pet. A Beefalo Hat can negate these effects for the wearer.

## Hunting

Beefalo attack every four seconds, making them easy to kite by striking quickly and dodging. Various weapons have different numbers of hits required to kill an adult Beefalo.

## Domesticating/Taming a Beefalo

Taming a Beefalo takes time and resources but provides significant benefits, including high-speed transportation and a melee weapon with unlimited durability.

### Overview

Tamed Beefalo provide advantages over other speed boosts, mounted combat mechanics, and different attributes based on their temperament.

### Mounted Combat Mechanics

While mounted, the player can make melee attacks, and mobs' melee attacks will hit the Beefalo instead of the player.

### Mating Season vs. Taming

A fully domesticated Beefalo will not go into heat or be influenced by mating season, but heat poses problems during the taming process.

### The 4 Attributes of Taming

Domestication, Obedience, Hunger (and Health), and Tendency are the four statistics to keep track of while taming a Beefalo.

#### Domestication

Beefalo gain domestication while being ridden or while their hunger is above zero. A Beefalo can be tamed in a minimum of 15 game-days with a brush, 20 without.

#### Hunger (and Health)

Beefalo have a maximum of 375 Hunger and lose 300 per day. Various foods can be used to feed and heal Beefalo.

#### Obedience

Obedience represents a Beefalo's willingness to be ridden, with a 10-step scale from 1-100 in increments of 10.

#### Tendencies

Tendencies are the special perks a fully tamed Beefalo will receive, influenced by the conditioning during taming.

The Weevole Mantle is a craftable armor item exclusive to the Hamlet DLC. It is found in the Fight Tab. It requires 4 Weevole Carapaces and 2 Chitins to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The Weevole Mantle has 900 hit points worth of durability and absorbs 65% of damage taken.

It does not contribute to the movement speed reduction caused by the Heavy Fog during the Humid Season. However, it does not prevent equipment in the helmet slot from slowing down the player.

The **Vortex Cloak** is a wearable **Armor** and **Inventory** extension, exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. In order to craft it, the player must obtain a **Blueprint** from the **Ancient Herald** or found in treasure chests on X marks the spot in Shipwrecked. It requires 5 **Dark Tatters** and a **Night Armor** to craft.

The Vortex Cloak has 2 more slots than a **Backpack** and has 450 durability, blocks all incoming damage from creatures other than **Shadow Creatures** and the **Ancient Herald**. Each hit removes Sanity from the player equal to 20% of the absorbed damage. The Vortex Cloak does not break when it reaches 0% durability, but will not continue absorbing damage and will simply function as a **Backpack**. The Vortex Cloak prevents **Poisoning** from physical attacks and grants stun immunity like the **Thulecite Crown's** force field while it has greater than 0% durability.

The Vortex Cloak can be repaired by using **Nightmare Fuel** or **Dark Tatters** on it. Each Nightmare Fuel used restores the Vortex Cloak's durability by 10% (or 45 HP), and each Dark Tatters used restores durability by 100% (or 450 HP).

### Tips
- Unlike other armors, if the Vortex Cloak is equipped while another hat is already worn (Making it the primary armor as it was equipped last), the Vortex Cloak will continue to remain the primary armor even if the hat is unequipped and re-equipped, or if it is swapped out for another. If one wishes to use the Vortex Cloak as secondary armor (for instance, to reduce durability/sanity loss by equipping a **Football Helmet** to cover most of the damage), one must not be wearing a hat when it is first equipped.
- Large quantities of **Nightmare Fuel** can be acquired for repairing a Vortex Cloak by sacrificing items to the **End's Well** and killing the Shadow Creatures that spawn.
- If the player is riding a Beefalo while wearing a Vortex Cloak above 0% durability, the Beefalo will gain the effects of the stun immunity but will still receive damage as normal.
- The Vortex Cloak will prevent the **Masked Pig** from knocking **Oincs** from the player's inventory.

# Don't Starve

![Logo](Logo.png)

- **Developer**: [Klei Entertainment](Klei Entertainment)
- **Platform**: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, PS4, PSVita, Wii U, iPad, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, Xbox One, PS3
- **Release Date**: April 23rd, 2013
- **Genre**: Action-adventure, survival horror, sandbox, roguelike
- **Modes**: Singleplayer (Sandbox, Adventure)
- **Distribution**: Download, Steam

## Official Description

Don’t Starve is an uncompromising wilderness survival game full of science and magic. You play as Wilson, an intrepid Gentleman Scientist who has been trapped by a demon and transported to a mysterious wilderness world. Wilson must learn to exploit his environment and its inhabitants if he ever hopes to escape and find his way back home.

Enter a strange and unexplored world full of strange creatures, dangers, and surprises. Gather resources to craft items and structures that match your survival style. Play your way as you unravel the mysteries of this strange land.

### Key Features:

- Uncompromising Survival & World Exploration: No instructions. No help. No hand holding. Start with nothing and craft, hunt, research, farm and fight to survive.
- Dark and Whimsical Visuals: 2D characters and odd creatures inhabiting a unique 3D world.
- Randomly Generated New Worlds: Want a new map? No problem! At any time you can generate a new living and breathing world that hates you and wants you to die.

## Overview

Don't Starve challenges the player to survive in a wilderness environment for as long as possible. In Survival Mode, the only way the game ends is with the player's death or by restarting the game in a new random world through the use of the Wooden Thing. When the player dies they are awarded Experience for the number of days they survived. Each death provides experience, which is added to a cumulative total and used to unlock additional playable characters. Although death is permanent and the player's world will be lost when the game ends, various methods of resurrection can be found to stave-off the inevitable.

## Plot

The canonical game plot centers around Wilson, a gentleman scientist tricked by the mysterious Maxwell into building a machine which transports him to a strange world filled with monsters and other challenges. The player must help Wilson navigate the various worlds of Adventure Mode, which offer more difficulty as the game progresses. Wilson will begin to understand why Maxwell brought him into this world and the terrible secret of his power. Along the way, the player will find an extra character who can only be unlocked during Adventure Mode, and he will eventually confront Maxwell himself.

## Updates

The game's developer, Klei Entertainment, has committed to a series of game updates for at least 6 months after the game's initial release. A large portion of these updates have focused on adding a new environment (Caves) to the game, along with other new content and bug fixes.

On January 10th, 2019, Klei Entertainment released the Quality of Life update that added features that were formerly exclusive to Don't Starve Together. These features were added to the base game as well as all DLCs. 

On April 27th 2023, Don't Starve Mega Update was added, fixing many long existing bugs, balancing changes and further adding many QoL Changes from Don't Starve Together.

## Repaired By

- Log
- Living Log
- Twigs
- Boards

The Spelunker's Bridge Kit can be placed to make a bridge to across the gap in the Caves, as long as the gap is no more than 6 tiles wide. To place the Spelunker's Bridge Kit, the player needs enough kits to match the bridge’s length. It cannot be placed next to another Bridge or if one side of the edge is blocked.

The Spelunker's Bridge Kit cannot be placed in the Atrium Maze, Ancient Guardian Labyrinth and Ancient Archive either.

Once placed, the Spelunker's Bridge is immune to all damage except for Earthquake. Each bridge, regardless of its length, has 200 health, and each Earthquake reduces its health by 50. It’s recommended to use Reinforced Pillars to protect the bridge from Earthquake damage.

When damaged, Spelunker's Bridge can be repaired by Boat Patch, Driftwood Piece, Log, Living Log, Twigs and Boards, restoring the same amount as repairing Boats. If the bridge is destroyed, anything on it will fall into Abyss. Items and structures on the bridge cannot be retrieved back, but the players will be sent back to the nearest land with all their items intact.

# Slurtle Mound

![Slurtle Mound](Image:Slurtle Mound.png)

A **Slurtle Mound** is a large, slimy rock pillar found in **Caves** which spawns **Slurtle**s (90%) and **Snurtle**s (10%) when hit or after an **Earthquake**. Slurtles/Snurtles emerge from the mound after earthquakes to eat the fallen **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Nitre**, **Gold**, and **Gems**. Snurtles rarely spawn from the Mound and flee immediately instead of attacking the player. Snurtles, when given the opportunity, will eat Earthquake items in the same fashion as the Slurtle.

- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Resources**: 3x **Slurtle Slime**, **Broken Shell**
- **Renew**: No
- **Spawn Code**: "slurtlehole"
- **Spawns**: **Slurtle** (90%), **Snurtle** (10%)
- **Health**: 350

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "A den of 'ew'."
- **Willow**: "I should burn them out."
- **Wolfgang**: "Hole full of slugs."
- **Wendy**: "The slurtles pop out when they outgrow it."
- **WX-78**: "THEY DON'T WEAR THEIR SHELLS IN THERE"
- **Wickerbottom**: "A gastropod pod."
- **Woodie**: "Are you guys doing okay in there?"
- **Maxwell**: "That's revolting."
- **Wagstaff**: "It appears to be fashioned from combustible materials."
- **Wigfrid**: "Nöt where I'd chööse tö hang my helm."
- **Webber**: "Slimy and rocky."
- **Walani**: "The snail things come out of there."
- **Warly**: "Yuck!"
- **Woodlegs**: "They slurtle their way in there, d'they?"
- **Wilba**: "‘TIS LAIR OF SLIME BEASTIES."
- **Wormwood**: "Spiky Shell home"
- **Wheeler**: "No way I'm going near that."
- **Winona**: "There's something gross in there."
- **Wortox**: "The hole where all the slurtles go!"
- **Wurt**: "Ooooh, slimy!"
- **Walter**: "I have to see what's in there!"
- **Wanda**: "Strange. Anyway, moving on..."

## Strategy
- Slurtles, when attacked, will either strike back or hide in their shells. Their Mounds can be destroyed by using a group of **Bunnymen** or **Rock Lobsters**, or even kite them away and attack.
- One can make an explosive farm with Slurtle Mounds. Both Slurtles and Snurtles are flammable and explosive, and they'll follow the player if they have any minerals. Guiding them to any dangerous monster and making them explode with the **Fire Staff** can take out the larger monsters.

### Graves

**Graves** or **Mounds** are naturally-appearing objects in the world that can be found individually in **Forests** or in a large group in **Graveyards** (which are characterized by large shrouds of fog). They may be found with or without a nearby **Headstone**, though graves without headstones can only be found in graveyards. Graves can only be dug up once, and each world has a limited number of them.

Each grave dug with a **Shovel** has a 10% chance to spawn a **Ghost**, which will be aggressive towards the player. Otherwise, the player has a 50% chance of finding a random **

## Bramble Trap Mechanics
- Bramble Trap damage will not aggro nearby mobs, nor will it increase a player's **Naughtiness**.
- Bramble Traps are also fireproof.
- A Bramble Trap can be picked up and placed elsewhere at any time, regardless of having been triggered or not.
- The following **Mobs** will not activate Bramble Traps:
  - Batilisks
  - Bees and Killer Bees
  - Birds
  - Butterflies
  - Chester
  - Dragonfly
  - Glommer
  - Gnat Swarms
  - Lureplants (and their Eyeplants)
  - Mosquitoes
  - Mounted Beefalo
  - Packim Baggims
  - Poison Mosquitoes
  - Shadow Creatures
  - Vampire Bats

## Tips
- Although clustering these traps together can be dangerous, the player can avoid damage altogether from these by wearing a **Bramble Husk**. This makes farming large groups of enemies like Spiders simple and easy.

# Campfire

The Campfire is a key to basic survival in the world. It provides [Light](#), Heat and allows [Food](#) to be [cooked](#). It requires 3 [Cut Grass](#) and 2 [Log](#)s to create and is available from the beginning of the game. It is cheaper than a Fire Pit in terms of resources, but also less efficient, as it can not be re-lit. The [Fuel Values](#) will burn twice as fast, it is more susceptible to [Rain](#), and it is less safe, as it may set nearby [Category:Flammable Objects](#) on fire. When burnt out, the Campfire drops 1 [Ashes](#) or 1 Charcoal.

## Quotes
- Wilson: Sure beats darkness.
- Willow: I like fire.
- Wolfgang: Good bye dark times!
- Wendy: I might survive this night!
- WX-78: A TEMPORARY ENCAMPMENT
- Wickerbottom: A camp fire.
- Woodie: Now where's my guitar?
- Maxwell: How comforting.
- Wagstaff: Combustion at its finest.
- Wigfrid: Warm fire, warm Wigfrid.
- Webber: Sure beats the cold. And darkness.
- Walani: My cozy campfire!
- Warly: To keep the dark at bay.
- Woodlegs: Anyone know a good sea shanty 'side me?
- Wilba: 'TIS FWOOSHING
- Wormwood: Not too close
- Wheeler: I know a thing or two about hot air.
- Winona: It'll last me the night, hopefully.
- Wortox: This fire will slake my thirst for warmth.
- Wurt: Time for story-tell around fire, florp!
- Walter: Anyone want to hear a scary story?
- Wanda: It keeps the shadows at bay.

# Fire Pit

A Fire Pit is the center of most base camps. It provides light and heat, allows [food](#) to be cooked, and is a contained, safer fire than a Campfire since it will not set surrounding objects on fire. It requires 2 [Logs](#) and 12 [Rocks](#) to craft and, like the Campfire, is available from the beginning of the game. It is a persistent structure, unlike Campfires, and can be re-lit by putting fuel in it. A Fire Pit is also more efficient than a Campfire, as the fuel will last 2 times longer, and it is less susceptible to Rain. It drops no Ashes when it burns out, but destroying it will drop the materials needed to build it.

## Quotes
- Wilson: Sure beats darkness.
- Willow: I could watch it for hours.
- Wolfgang: Good bye dark times!
- Wendy: A flame to keep the horrors at bay.
- WX-78: A TEMPORARY ENCAMPMENT
- Wickerbottom: A fire pit.
- Woodie: It uses wood.
- Maxwell: A fire pit.
- Wagstaff: It ignites at the mere introduction of fuel!
- Wigfrid: Warm fire, warm Wigfrid.
- Webber: Sure beats the cold. And darkness.
- Walani: Oh, sweet enemy of darkness.
- Warly: To warm my fingers and roast sausages.
- Woodlegs: Need ta be careful ta not burn me legs.
- Wilba: TIS GOOD FWOOSHINGS!
- Wormwood: Not too close
- Wheeler: I know a thing or two about hot air.
- Winona: It's the pits out here.
- Wortox: This fire will slake my thirst for warmth.
- Wurt: Time for story-tell around fire, florp!
- Walter: Anyone want to hear a scary story?
- Wanda: It keeps the shadows at bay.

# Critters in Don't Starve Together

Critters, also known as Pets, are passive immortal Mobs in Don't Starve Together, introduced in A New Reign. They look like baby versions of some other Mobs in the game and can be obtained from the Critters Tab while standing next to the Rock Den. Each pet requires two Items to adopt, an item related to the mob and a specific food made with a Crock Pot.

## Characteristics

Critters will make noise when hungry, but won't die if not fed. Critters can be fed anything edible, including Winter's Feast Eternal Fruitcake, Rot, and Rotten Eggs. Any food given refreshes the critter's hunger time to its maximum. Critters have a hunger time of 2 days after which they will be considered starving. Because critter hunger is handled using the same system as food spoilage, the rate at which they become hungry is affected by weather the same way other perishable items are.

There is a "mini-game" around critters' maximum hunger time. Players can increase this time to up to 4.5 days (5.5 for "Plump" critters) in the increments of 0.5, by feeding the critter when it is between its 20% and 50% hunger time remaining. When it is fed when with less than 20% hunger time remaining, this maximum time will decrease. Feeding the critter when it has above 50% of its hunger time remaining has no effect on the maximum hunger time. A critter can be "pet" by clicking on it, triggering a small animation.

## Description

A **Burrow** is a naturally occurring object from the **Reign of Giants** DLC that randomly spawns in **Grassland** biomes. **Moleworms** will spawn at **Dusk** and **Night** from Burrows and start roaming around the area, looking for minerals and other ground-based items to store inside the Burrows.

Burrows can be dug up with a **Shovel** to randomly yield **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Nitre**, and **Gold Nugget**s. When dug, Burrows will also drop any item stolen by Moleworms. Burrows can store up to 50 inventory slots; any extra items that moleworm attempt to store, but cannot do so due to filled inventory, will pop out.

If a Burrow is dug up, the Moleworm that inhabited it will make a new one after some time. This makes Burrows renewable as long as the Moleworm is not also killed. If a Moleworm is killed, the Burrow will spawn a new Moleworm after 2.5 **Days**, in the same way **Rabbit Holes** spawn **Rabbits**. However, it is worth noting that even if all of the Moleworms and Burrows in a world are killed or destroyed, respectively, they are still renewable through both **Catcoons**, **Tumbleweeds**, and **Earthquakes**. Because Burrows drop minerals and Moleworms can create new Burrows, this makes Rocks, Flint, Nitre, and Gold renewable.

## Description
Snake Bones are a loot item exclusive to the **Hamlet** DLC. They are acquired after defeating the **Pugalisk** boss. They can be used in the **Crock Pot** to produce **Snake Bone Soup**.

Unlike **Twigs**, Snake Bones are considered an edible ingredient in the crockpot and can be used as filler for **Meatballs**, **Pierogi**, **Fishsticks**, **Honey Nuggets**, etc.

Snake Bones can also be **Hammer**ed to obtain 2 **Bone Shards**.

## Usage

### Hammering Snake Bones
- **Item:** Snake Bone
- **Count:** 1
- **Tool:** Hammer

### Cooking Snake Bones

- **Willow**: Drat, won't burn.
- **Wolfgang**: Ugly, ugly, ugly.
- **Wendy**: Not very attractive.
- **WX-78**: A NIGHTMARE INDICATOR

- **Wortox**: Hyuyu, how spooky!
- **Wurt**: Creepy.
- **Walter**: Woah! Is this what they looked like?
- **Wanda**: What's left from a time long ago.

**Ancient Statues** are structures found in the [[Ruins]] and part of the remnants of the [[Ancient Civilization]]. When mined, they will drop a [[Gem]] and 1 [[Thulecite]], plus a 5% chance of 1 extra Thulecite. The color of gem that drops will be the same type that appears on the statue, either in the staff or at the base. If the statue does not have a gem embedded in it, it will drop [[Nightmare Fuel]] in its place.

In ''[[Don't Starve]]'', the color changes when reloading the game or travelling to the cave level and back. This makes it possible to choose which gems the statues will drop when mined; gemless statues will remain gemless however. 

The appearance of the statues change depending on the current phase of the Ruin's Nightmare Cycle. They emit light during all phases, except "Calm". At the most intense state, the statues will be covered in Nightmare Fuel and gain a hazy glowing quality (though their light radius does not increase). If mined during the Nightmare phase, there is a 30% chance for a [[Shadow Creature#Terrorbeak|Nightmarebeak]] or [[Shadow Creature#Crawling Horror|Crawling Nightmare]] to spawn, with equal chances.

In the ''[[Hamlet]]'' DLC, gems in Ancient Statues can be removed with a [[Ball Pein Hammer]].

**Trivia:**

- Even though they can't be mined, broken versions of the Atrium Statues can be found in the game files.

**Bugs:**

- The damaged versions of these statues will revert to its original form after saving and reloading the game.

## Scrapbook Info
The Ageless Watch can be used to reduce the age of Wanda; every use will lower her age by 8. It has a cooldown of 2 minutes and requires 1 Time Pieces, 2 Marble, and 1 Red Gem to craft.

Multiple Ageless Watches have their own different cooldowns and can be used in quick succession to restore her age.

## Tips
When Wanda gets hit, her age will not change instantly, but gradually increase to ultimately match the damage received, so she can use the Ageless Watch to cut off the age increasing debuff and reduce the age she would have gained as a result.

### Description

The **Cawnival Tree** is a craftable structure that is only available during the Midsummer Cawnival event. Interacting with the placed tree will allow the player to ring a bell, summoning **Corvus Goodfeather** to fly to the tree. Placing the tree also unlocks new items in the **Cawnival Creation Filter** when the player interacts with Corvus Goodfeather. The Cawnival Tree can be chopped down with 10 hits of an **Axe** to return it as an item.

The appearance of the tree changes slightly as the player adds new decorations around the tree and up to three new **Crow Kid**s will fly in to wander around the Cawnival Tree. The decorations can be purchased at **Prize Booth**. When points of decorations reach 100, the tree gets to level 2 and has one more Crow Kid. When it reaches 200 points, the tree gets to level 3 and has a total of 3 Crow Kids.

# Mushtrees

Mushtrees are naturally generated objects that act as light sources inside **Caves**.

- **Wolfgang**: Big mushtree is big.
- **Wendy**: These are some strange trees.
- **WX-78**: IT IS ADVANTAGEOUSLY BRIGHT

- **Wortox**: Delightfully disgusting!
- **Wurt**: Look kinda tasty, florp
- **Walter**: That one's not in my handbook...
- **Wanda**: I wonder how it got so big? Rather, I wonder what it's been feeding on...
- **Choose**: Maxwell
- **Source**: When examining a Blue Mushtree.

## Description

The most common variant is the Blue Mushtree, which can be chopped down, providing 2 **Logs** and a **Blue Cap**. Using a **Shovel** or a **Regal Shovel** to dig up the stump that will provide another Log or burn it to yield 1 **Ash**. Mushtrees also come in green and red varieties, which drop a **Green Cap** and **Red Cap** respectively upon harvest, as well as a single Log. When set on **fire**, a Mushtree will eventually burn to a crisp and disappear, dropping 1 Ash and 1 **Charcoal**.

Unlike **Evergreens**, which drop **Pine Cones** that can be planted, there is no way for the player to regrow Mushtrees unless they reset the Cave they were chopped in with the **Seed of Ruin**.

## Downloadable Content

During **Full Moons** in all **DLC**s, **Mushrooms** (both in Caves and on the **Surface World**) will turn into Mushtrees. If a Mushroom-turned-Mushtree has been chopped, its stump will turn into a harvested Mushroom spawn point once the Full Moon ends.

## Tips

Chopping down Mushtrees is an easy way to get caps while in the caves. However, Mushtrees also provide a small but free and unending source of light. Illumination frequently means life or **death** in the caves, so discretion should be used when deciding whether or not to harvest.

## Trivia

- According to **Wickerbottom** and **Wagstaff**, Mushtrees are regular trees infected with fungal parasites.
- Wickerbottom also notes that the red and green mushtrees are "*Mycena luxaeterna*" and "*Mycena silvaelucens*" respectively.
- The fungal genus "*Mycena*" is known in real life for their bioluminescence.
- "Luxeterna" translates to English as "eternal light", and "silvaelucens" translates to "bright forest".

The **Cork Bat** is a craftable **Weapon** exclusive to the **Hamlet** DLC. It is found in the **Fight Tab**, requires 3 **Cork** and **Boards** to craft, and a **Science Machine** to prototype. Unlike other weapons, the Cork Bat has a noticeable delay between strikes, although the attack speed is faster than unarmed attacks. After each strike, the Cork Bat makes the player unable to move or act for a brief time, which puts the player into disadvantage as this can hinder the player's ability to dodge enemy attacks in time. It should therefore be treated as cheap, readily available weapon if supplies aren't available for superior choices.

### Tips
- Due to how the Cork Bat hinders the player's ability to effectively dodge, it can be used against enemies with long pauses between attacks. One example is that of Shadow Creatures, which disappear after being hit and reappear further away.
- The Cork Bat is effectively used against mobs with less than 51 health, as it can instantly kill them, hence removing the need to dodge.
- A fully fed **Wolfgang** deals 102 damage with the Cork Bat, putting it over the 100 health threshold. This means that he can one shot mobs such as **Spiders**, **Bees**, **Mosquitoes**, **Snakes**, **Frogs**, and Red/Blue **Hounds**.
- The Cork Bat has no slowdown when used on a boat, making it ideal for ocean combat.
- The Cork Bat's slow attack recovery can be cancelled by **Wheeler**'s Dodge.

### Trivia
- The Cork Bat originally had red details on the hilt, but the color was changed in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet#Version History** update. The shape of it also changed a bit.

# Hello! I will teach you how I explore the map!

I always play as [WX-78], so I can stockpile food. I always go around the [ocean] to outline the map, then go fill in the inside. Avoid early battles, but set up a [Science Machine] for a [spear], [Log Suit] and [boards]. Perhaps even a [Football Helmet]   

## Gallery
![Armored Set WX-78](Armored Set WX-78.png)

If a [hound] attack occurs, wear all. Here are things you will have to confront:

1. Night
2. Food
3. [Treeguards]
4. [Spiders]
5. Clockworks
6. Sanity drain
7. Health loss
8. Hound attacks
9. Inventory space

These are avoidable:
- Fire damage
- [Overheating] (DST)
- Boss fights
- Spleunking
- [Maxwell's Door]
- Wooden thing set pieces
- General fighting

If anything is incorrect, please comment.

# Alchemy Engine

The '''Alchemy Engine''' is the tier 2 [[Science]] station. It requires a [[Science Machine]] to prototype for all characters except [[Wickerbottom]], and costs 4 [[Boards]], 2 [[Cut Stone]]s, and 6 [[Gold Nugget]]s to craft. Prototyping an [[Item]] using the Alchemy Engine will increase [[Sanity]] by 15.

...

</details>

## Downloadable Content

In the ''[[Reign of Giants]]'', ''[[Shipwrecked]]'', and ''[[Hamlet]]'' DLCs, as well as ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'', the 6 Gold Nuggets in the crafting recipe are replaced by 2 [[Electrical Doodad]]s.

In the ''Shipwrecked'' DLC, the Alchemy Engine can be [[flooding|flooded]].

## Tips

* An easy way to gather the crafting materials for an Alchemy Engine is to hammer down [[Pig House|Pig Houses]] for Boards and Cut Stones, and to mine [[Boulder|Gold Vein Boulders]] for Gold.
* The Alchemy Engine is able to unlock Tier 1 items without the need for a nearby Science Machine, so it may be beneficial to break down the Science Machine for resources after building it.
* Since Wickerbottom has Tier 2 items unlocked with the Science Machine, this machine is only necessary for crafting her book [[On Tentacles]].

## Trivia

* In the [[Version History|early Beta]] version of ''[[Don't Starve]]'', the game used a "[[Research points list|Research Points]]" system, instead of prototyping. Crafting this station cost 200 Research Points.
* As of the ''[[New Features#July 23.2C 2013 - Hungry For Your Hunger|Hungry For Your Hunger]]'' update, Tier 3 recipes crafted using the [[Shadow Manipulator]] have been moved to the Alchemy Engine, due to the separation of Science and [[Magic]].

# Spilagmite

![Spilagmite](Spilagmite.png)

A Spilagmite is a different kind of [[Spider Den]] found only in [[Caves]]. It spawns [[Spider/Cave Spider|Cave Spiders]] and [[Spider/Spitter|Spitters]]. Spiders will regularly spawn from a Spilagmite at a rate of 1 approximately every 4 minutes, unless something makes them spawn differently (e.g., something walks on the webbing or an earthquake occurs).

## Object Infobox

- **Spawn Code**: `spiderhole`
- **Resources**: [[Rocks]] x2, [[Silk]] x1.5, [[Spider Gland]] x0.25
- **Renew**: No
- **Tool**: Can be [[Tools#Mining_Tools|Mined]] with a [[Pickaxe]]
- **Spawns**: [[Cave Spider]] and [[Spitter]]

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: It's encrusted with old webbing.
- **Willow**: It's full of spiders.
- **Wolfgang**: Spiders everywhere.
- **Wendy**: It is infested.
- **WX-78**: SPIDERS DETECTED
- **Wickerbottom**: This is the source of the spider infestation.
- **Woodie**: I should skedaddle before they come out of there.
- **Maxwell**: How did that get down here?
- **Wagstaff**: I am very curious about its arachnid generating properties.
- **Wigfrid**: Webbing. Never a good sign.
- **Webber**: We could stand to live there.
- **Walani**: It's a hole. Full of SPIDERS.
- **Warly**: I have no reason to investigate any further.
- **Woodlegs**: Whut lives innna hole ain't worth me time.
- **Wilba**: A HOLE FROM WHENCE SPIDER COMETH
- **Wormwood**: Something hiding?
- **Wheeler**: Looks like a swell place to live.
- **Winona**: A rock filled with spiders. Great.
- **Wortox**: All webbed up!
- **Wurt**: Spiderfolk hole!
- **Walter**: Someone needs to dust more often, everything's covered in cobwebs!
- **Wanda**: I can hear them skittering inside...

## Spilagmite Mechanics

- A Spilagmite may contain up to 2 or 3 Spiders. The maximum may vary between Spilagmites.
- If the number of Spiders drops below the maximum, an additional Spider will spawn inside the Spilagmite in approximately 2 minutes.
- If an [[Earthquake]] occurs, all spiders outside will return to their home provided that home remains existing.
- Spiders spawned from a Spilagmite have a 33% chance to be a Spitter; the rest will be Cave Spiders.
- Unlike Spider Dens on the surface, the type of Spider spawned is always based on this probability and does not change due to circumstances (e.g., attacking the Spilagmite).

## Destruction

A Spilagmite can be destroyed by mining it with any [[Pickaxe]] or a [[Pick/Axe]], causing it to disappear and drop 1 [[Silk]] and 2 [[Rocks]], possibly with an additional Silk and [[Spider Gland]]. After two strikes, the Spilagmite loses its ability to spawn Spiders. Striking an active Spilagmite will spawn all remaining spiders still contained within.

## Sticky Webbing

Like surface Spider Dens, Spilagmites produce Sticky Webbing, which will alert the Cave Spiders and Spitters inside if a creature touches it. When the webbing is stepped on, two spiders will emerge simultaneously, provided at least two are inside the Spilagmite at the time. If any Spider is attacked within range of the Spilagmite, or the Spilagmite itself is attacked, all remaining Spiders in the Spilagmite will emerge to engage the threat.

If the spiders that emerged are not killed and lose interest in their foe, they will stay outside their Spilagmite and roam the area.

## Bugs

- Allowing a [[Clockwork Rook]] to collide with a Spilagmite sometimes crashes the game.
- The player can attempt to heal a Spilagmite with any healing item; however, a mined one will not return to its original state, despite how many healing items the player gives it.

## Quotes
- Wolfgang: "Is so fragile!"
- Wilson: "The coral's formed a reef!"
- Willow: "I wish I had a snorkel."
- Woodie: "Ripe for the picking."
- Maxwell: "This could likely support a wide array of life."
- Wagstaff: "A colorful collection of Cnidaria."
- Wendy: "The coral grows to escape the sea."
- Woodlegs: "Ye better steer clear, Woodlegs."
- Wickerbottom: "I adore marine invertebrates!"
- Webber: "A coral party!"
- Warly: "A rainbow searock."
- WX78: "PEAK CORAL PRODUCTION"
- Walani: "What a pretty coral reef."
- Wigfrid: "A hard and brittle place. I like it."
- Wilba: "PRETTY ROCKS 'NEATH THE WATER"
- Wormwood: "Rock party"
- Wheeler: "Really goes out of its way to be an obstacle, doesn't it?"
- Choose: "Wickerbottom"

When mined with a **Pickaxe**, Coral Reefs drop 2-4 pieces of Coral total. After being mined, they can be **Hammer**ed to drop 1-3 **Limestone**s and a **Coral Larva**. If the rock is not hammered, the Coral will fully grow back after 12 **Days**. It has a heavily increased grow rate during rain, similar to **Mushrooms**. It is also possible to replant Coral Reefs using **Coral Nubbins**.

## Trivia
- The option to replant Coral Reefs was added to the **Shipwrecked** DLC more than a year after its official completion in the **Home Sea Home** update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.
- Before the **Home Sea Home** update, the Coral Reef's Limestone used to sink, and the only way to retrieve it was by using a **Trawl Net**.

## Bugs
- Sometimes, Coral Reefs will not regenerate offscreen after 12 days when the player is too far away from them.
- Some Coral Reefs may spawn on top of (or very close to) other objects (like a **Seaweed Plant** or other Coral Reefs), making them impossible to harvest.

## Tips
- Tooth Traps are ineffective against Lureplants and their Eyeplants; Eyeplants will eat Tooth Traps.
  - Placing man-made Turf will prevent Eyeplants from spawning.
- A useful way to kill Pigs, or other mobs, without increasing Naughtiness, is to place food near the Tooth Traps (ideally so the trap will kill the victim before it reaches the food).
- Surrounding small groups of about 4 Berry Bushes with Walls and Tooth Traps allow farming Gobblers, which also protects unharvested Berries from them. When the Gobbler tries to exit, one of the Tooth Traps will kill it instantly.
  - Alternatively, 1 Tooth Trap can be placed in front of a Berry Bush, instantly killing a Gobbler that spawns from the bush.
- Tooth Traps can be an effective way to kill Boss Monsters, or other tough enemies, if they are densely packed into one area.
- A "panic room" can be made with as little as 10 Tooth Traps. It should be made
