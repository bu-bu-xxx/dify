## Origin

Maxwell's backstory is given in the Compendium. Formerly the king of the Nightmare Throne, he was once William Carter, a penniless man from London who dreamt of being a world-renowned magician. After gaining possession of the Codex Umbra, he embraced his new persona as a charismatic master of dark magic. His quest for more power led to his downfall, and he was trapped in the Constant, compelled to ensnare more victims.

- Maxwell's examination quote for Tallbirds reveals that he created them by accident through a failed experiment.
- Maxwell has a brother named Jack Carter, as revealed in the William Carter Puzzles.

### {{Quote|Hmmm. I wonder if these will burn.|Willow}}

**Willow** is the Second playable **Character** in *Don't Starve* that can be unlocked via **Experience**, when the player reaches 160 XP. She is also one of the playable Characters in *Don't Starve Together* (DST). She is a young woman who is obsessed with fire.

As part of the *Don't Starve Together* content updates, Willow received a character refresh on May 7, 2019.[^1]

Willow's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled *From the Ashes*. An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [[Compendium]]:

*Willow always regarded being brought to [[The Constant]] as a new beginning. It allowed her to leave everything behind, after all. From a young age, Willow seemed to possess a knack for attracting bad luck. Orphaned at a young age and forced to live in a children's home with cruel caregivers, she soon found her nights plagued by shadowy visions of terrible creatures... creatures that could only be held at bay by her faithful teddy bear Bernie. But when Bernie was taken away as punishment for what her caregivers saw as unfit behavior, Willow was left to fend for herself when the shadows came for her. That's when she learned that nothing holds back the darkness like a roaring flame. Nothing is more comforting than watching your troubles light up and crumble to ash...  It wouldn't be the last time Willow burned it all down to start anew.*

## {{pic|32|Placeholder}} Trivia

### In-Game
* Willow was added to the original Don't Starve Chrome build on August 7, 2012.[^2]
* Willow's voice is played by a flute.
* Willow has a [[Unimplemented Items#Player Skulls|skull]] in the game files.
* Willow's previous perk, before the [[Version History#July 2, 2013 - Strange New Powers|Strange New Powers]] update, was to light fires at her feet when in darkness, like she does when low on Sanity now.
* When struck by [[Lightning]] in DLCs, Willow, like most other Characters, is shown to have bones in her hair. In addition to this, she has bones in her skirt.
* Willow was the second Don't Star

# Krampus

## Behavior

Krampus is a neutral monster that steals the player's stored items and items left on the ground. It appears when players gain too much Naughtiness from killing innocent creatures too fast.

### Quotes

- Wilson: He's going after my stuff!
- Willow: Stay back, you big jerk!
- Wolfgang: Scary goat man! Run!
- Wendy: Hello, foul creature of the underworld.
- WX78: STOP! THIEF!
- Wickerbottom: It's a mythological holiday monster.
- Woodie: Back off, hoser!
- Maxwell: You'll never catch me!
- Wagstaff: He appears to be drawn to my moral ambiguity.
- Wigfrid: Yöu dön't scare me, göat!
- Webber: Give us back our things!
- Walani: Stealing isn't cool!
- Warly: What the devil!
- Woodlegs: What did ol'Woodlegs do?
- Wilba: 'TIS BIG MEANY
- Wormwood: Mean Branch Head
- Wheeler: Whoops. All those little bad acts have come back to haunt me.
- Winona: Some sort of... festive devil?
- Wortox: Heh heh. No hard feelings?
- Wurt: Big meanie!!
- Walter: Hey! Did you rifle through my supplies?
- Wanda: He really puts a damper on this time of year.

## Naughtiness

Naughtiness is generated by killing certain creatures. Once the player reaches a threshold of naughtiness, Krampus will spawn. After Krampus appears, the naughtiness level is reset to 0.

## Strategy

Krampus, especially when more than one spawns at the same time, can wreak havoc in a player's base without adequate preparation. Players are advised to pay attention to the signs of naughtiness, and only summon Krampus when preparations are complete; away from important items and the player's base.

## Downloadable Content

- In the Reign of Giants DLC, killing Glommer will immediately summon Krampii as it increases naughtiness by 50 points, the exact amount needed to spawn Krampus.
- In the Shipwrecked DLC, Krampus will be wearing a Floral Shirt on his visit to the islands.
- In the Hamlet DLC, Krampus has the ability to enter interiors.

## Tips

- Summoning Krampus at night will summon sleeping Krampii, including during a Full Moon, which allows them to be easily killed.
- Tooth Traps are not very effective against Krampus since there is a chance that he will steal the trap instead of activating it.
- Various forms of "Krampus traps" can be created utilizing their behavior of stealing items.

## Trivia

- Krampus was added in the Naughty and Nice update.
- Krampus is a beast-like creature from the folklore of Alpine countries, thought to punish bad children during the Yule season by whipping them into submission.

# WX-78

## Origin

WX-78's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled [[Animated Shorts and Trailers#Disconnected|Disconnected]].

An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [[Compendium]]:

''WX-78 was the result of an unorthodox experiment helmed by {[LoadEmpathyModLibraryExW()......ERROR_DATA_PATH_NOT_FOUND]} and Robert Wagstaff. The experiment turned out to be a [RESOUNDING SUCCESS], but Wagstaff was [A SHORT SIGHTED FOOL, AFRAID OF PROGRESS] and decided to put a stop to further tests. Adamant that the process that created them could still be perfected, WX refused to give up, continuing their experiments in secret. When Wagstaff discovered what they had been doing, there was a heated argument and01110100 01101111 01101111 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101 00100000 01110100 01101111 01101111 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101 00100000 01110100 01101111 01101111 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101''

## Tips

- WX-78 acts like a [[Lightning Rod]]. If any event launches multiple lightning strikes, such as reading [[The End is Nigh]], '''all''' strikes will usually target WX-78.
- Equipping an [[Umbrella]] alongside a hat that offers at least 10% rain protection (such as the [[Straw Hat]]) will completely shield WX-78 from Rain, preventing any damage from being taken.
- WX-78 players may want to avoid using items that offer Lightning immunity (such as the Umbrella or [[Eyebrella]]) if they require healing, though they will take a hit to their Sanity with each strike.
- Using the [[Ice Cube]] or [[Fashion Melon]] as protection from [[Overheating]] is not advised, as the Wetness gained from those items will damage WX-78.
- WX-78's gear consumption ability & light-providing circuits makes them one of the better equipped characters for traversing the [[Ruins]].
- Since they ignore spoilage and food loses all sanity restoration as soon as it turns stale, WX-78 players have at least double the time to utilize foods that grant high sanity but spoil quickly, giving them a distinct advantage over other characters in terms of sanity management.
- In DST, WX-78's [[Don't Starve Together#Favorite Food|favorite food]] is [[Butter Muffin]], meaning that they gain 15 bonus {{Hunger}} when consuming the food.

## Trivia

### In-Game

- WX-78 was added to ''Don't Starve'' in the ''[[Don't Starve/Version_History#January 15, 2013 – Spoiled Rotten|Spoiled Rotten]]'' update on January 15, 2013.
- WX-78's voice is played by what is explained as a "crazy processed synth".
- WX-78 has a [[Unimplemented Features#Player Skulls|Skull]] in the game files. Also, when struck by Lightning, a skeleton can be seen.
- WX-78 makes a unique creaking noise as they walk.
- Although they take damage from Wetness, WX-78 can eat watery foods such as [[Pomegranate]]s, [[Meaty Stew]], or even [[Watermelon]]s without being harmed.
- WX-78 is one of the original four Characters that were available during the closed Beta of DST.
- In DST, if the player communicates to others with the Y or U keys as WX-78, all messages will be sent in uppercase letters like their original dialogue.
- Most of their audio files are labelled Woodrow, which may indicate they were originally meant for an [[Unimplemented Characters|unimplemented character]] who also has their own audio files in the code. That, or Woodrow was an early iteration of their character.
- WX-78 is oddly inconsistent with their punctuation in quotes. For instance, they often leave the end of their sentences without a period.
- When WX-78 examines a [[Slurper]], they will say "IT VIOLATED MY SMELLING MODULE", but when they examine a [[Durian]], they will say "GOOD THING I LACK A NOSE". This inconsistency may be intentional for comedic effect or just an error.
- WX-78 was originally planned to speak in randomly generated binary.<ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/6745-wx78-the-autom

The Rain Hat is a craftable Dress item from the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC. It requires 2 Moleworms, 1 Straw Hat, and 1 Bone Shard to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The Sewing Kit repairs 50% of its durability.

When worn during Rain, it protects against Wetness gain by 70%. Additionally, it insulates the player against Lightning strikes and the electric shocks of a charged Volt Goat.

## Trivia
- Rain Hats require Moleworms to craft because the moleskin is known for its water-resistance.
- The crafting recipe used to require Tentacle Spots instead of Moleworms.
- Wearing this hat while standing under a Tree provides sufficient Wetness protection from rain.

# Wigfrid
Wigfrid is one of the two playable **Characters** exclusive to the **Reign of Giants** DLC. She is the seventh Character to be unlocked via **Experience**, with 1920 XP. She is also one of the playable Characters in **Don't Starve Together** (DST). Although Wigfrid has the appearance of a **Valkyrie**, she's just a stage actress.

## Origin
Wigfrid's backstory was revealed in the animated short **The Curtain Calls**. The short is officially summarized in DST's **Compendium**:
"Wigfrid always knew she was meant for the stage. Her debut performance was an instant sensation, launching her from obscurity to overnight stardom. Fans delighted in her portrayal of a noble and fearsome Valkyrie warrior, and she in turn took great pains to fully embody the role. She was perfect for it... perhaps too perfect. Every part she played afterward seemed to fall flat, never again achieving that magical quality that had once drawn audiences to her performances like bees to honey. As Wigfrid’s stardom slowly began to fade, she retreated to the memories of her glory days, losing herself in her fantasies...''

"Until one day, she was lost entirely."

## Trivia
### In-Game
- Wigfrid was added to **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** in the **A Feet of Strength** update on March 12, 2014.
- In **Don't Starve**, anytime Wigfrid uses the letter "O", she says it with umlauts ("Ö"), even if there are two in a row. In DST, only the first of consecutive "O"s will have an umlaut. Umlauts can be toggled in the settings, using the "Umlautify" option.
- Wigfrid is voiced by very processed brass horns.
- Despite Butterfly Wings/butter muffins being made from an animal, she cannot eat them.
- Wigfrid’s birthday is listed as March 23rd in the **Compendium**.
- While being described as excellent in combat, Wigfrid's bonuses are outclassed by those of other characters; most also have higher Hunger and Sanity while lacking her inability to eat non-meat foods. On the other hand, Wigfrid is the only character to have combat bonuses in so many fields (attack power, damage resistance, starting equipment, and health/Sanity regeneration), and she also lacks the other characters' weaknesses; overall, she is a "Jack of all trades, master of none" type of character when it comes to fighting.

### Lore
- Wigfrid dislikes **Mushrooms**, according to her **examination quotes**.
- Wigfrid is able to break character, as shown by her quotes when entering/leaving light ("And the curtain falls."; "I step intö the light!") and when examining a **Top Hat** ("It döesn't match my cöstume.") or a **Pirate Hat** ("This hat cönfuses my character... I mean, my söul.").
- Wigfrid's DST **loading screen vignette** is accompanied by text that reveals a bit about her acting skills: "The valor and confidence of a Valkyrie didn't always come naturally to Wigfrid. She cultivated her strength and persona over many years through sheer force of will."

### Cultural References
- Wigfrid is referred to as **Wathgrithr** in the game files, which comes from the name of a Valkyrie, Ráðgríðr (Rathgrithr).
- Wigfrid's role as an actress may be a reference to the famous opera cycle by Richard Wagner called **The Ring of The Nibelung**. Her name may be a reference to the same opera cycle's main character Siegfried, but the character is possibly based on the main female character, a valkyrie named Brynhilde.
- Her motto for DST is a reference to a **Shakespeare quote**.
- Toni from **Rhymes with Play** #201 said that Wigfrid's Victorian skin is based on an illustration by Alphonse Mucha, which depicts Sarah Bernhardt as Prince Hamlet from the **titular Shakespeare play**.
- Wigfrid's Contender skin set is called "The Ultimate Performer", which may be a reference to **The Ultimate Warrior**, a professional wrestler. Her mask even calls to mind The Ultimate Warrior's famous face paint.
- Her The Snowfallen skin possibly refers to frost giant or **Jötunn** from norse mythology.
- Wigfrid Magmatic quote ref to **Surtr** from Norse mythology.
- Wigfrid Magmatic description ref to **Ragnarök

They can be used in the Crock Pot and count as 0.5 units of Meat and 1 unit of Fish. They are specifically required to cook the Tropical Bouillabaisse. Purple Groupers cannot be dried using a Drying Rack.

# Deconstruction Staff

## Overview

The Deconstruction Staff is a craftable item found in the Ancient Tab. It requires at least a Broken Pseudoscience Station to craft, and costs 4 Nightmare Fuel, 2 Living Logs, and 2 Green Gems to craft. It can also randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when the latter is damaged with a Hammer, Gunpowder, etc. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Deconstruction Staves cannot be prototyped and can only be crafted within range of an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

## Usage

When used on a craftable Structure, the Deconstruction Staff returns 100% of the ingredients needed to craft it. However, when used on an Item, the Staff will return a percentage of the materials equal to the remaining durability, rounded up. If Gems were used in the crafting process, they will not be returned and will always "shatter" instead. With each use of the Staff, Characters will lose 20 sanity and the Staff will lose 20% of its Durability.

### Content Downloadable

In the Reign of Giants DLC, players have a small (0.02%) chance of finding Green Gems inside Tumbleweeds, thus making Deconstruction Staves renewable.

In the Hamlet DLC, the Deconstruction Staff is one of the two items that can permanently destroy Town Houses, Pig Shops, Watch Towers, Lawn Decorations, Intricate Topiaries, and Hedges that cannot be destroyed with a Hammer. The other is the Executive Hammer.

| Thulecite Wall | Thulecite×0.167 | Thulecite×1 | Green Gem×0.24 Living Log×0.2 Nightmare Fuel×0.52 | Thulecite×0.753 |

## Tips

- Since Green Gems are so rare, the best use for Deconstruction Staffs is on Items or Structures that require very rare or non-renewable materials (e.g. items from the Ancient or Magic Tab).
- Some items that are created using a single non-renewable ingredient (e.g. Pan Flute) can be deconstructed and crafted again to extend their usage, since the Staff will always return at least one of the non-gem materials used.

# Crafting

Crafting is an in-game mechanic that allows players to craft or make **Items** and **Structures**. This is done by selecting an item or structure to be crafted in one of the 19 **Crafting Tabs** (including **DLC**s, and **Character-Specific** tabs). Provided the player has sufficient materials in their inventory and, if necessary, has **unlocked** the item recipe, they will receive 1 or more of the crafted item. Below are the crafting tables for the different game modes available. The availability of crafting recipes are further affected by game version, the player's world (Game Mode), special **Events**, etc.

## Unlocked

Unlocking for the first time will grant the player 15 **Sanity**. Once unlocked, items can be crafted any time.

### Prototype

Generally, each Item or Structure must be **"prototyped"** at a particular **Prototyper** or through other means to be unlocked. Once the item has been unlocked, it can be crafted anywhere, anytime (so long as the required materials are available). Tier 1 items can be unlocked at either a **Science Machine** or **Alchemy Engine**. Tier 2 items can only be unlocked at an Alchemy Engine, ETC.

*Some recipes require the player in a specified world to be available. (Removed in Hamlet version)
**Some recipes require the player to be in a specified world to Prototypeable. (Add in Hamlet version)

Standing near the Prototyper allows prototyping new recipes. The following is a list of all the Prototypers:

| ![Science Machine](Science Machine.png) | [Science Machine](Science Machine) Tier 1 |
| ![Alchemy Engine](Alchemy Engine.png) | [Alchemy Engine] Tier 2 |
| ![Prestihatitator](Prestihatitator.png) | [Prestihatitator] Tier 1 |
| ![Shadow Manipulator](Shadow Manipulator.png) | [Shadow Manipulator] Tier 2 |
| ![Sea Lab](Sea Lab.png) | [Sea Lab] Tier 2 |
| ![Piratihatitator](Piratihatitator.png) | [Piratihatitator] Tier 1 |
| ![Hogus Porkusator](Hogus Porkusator.png) | [Hogus Porkusator] Tier 1 |

## Blueprint

## Webber's Switcherdoodle

## Crafting Station

Crafting Station is similar to Prototyper, except that they do not unlock the recipe for the player after they make it, so the player must return to Crafting Station if they want to make the item again. In the **Hamlet** DLC, the interior areas of **Slanty Shanty** can be considered to be a hidden Crafting Station. The Key to the City can be carried in the inventory, making it movable unlike other Crafting Stations.

The following is a list of all the Crafting Station:

| ![Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station](Broken Pseudoscience Station Build.png) | [Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station] |
| ![Ancient Pseudoscience Station](Ancient Pseudoscience Station.png) | [Ancient Pseudoscience Station] |
| ![Obsidian Workbench](Obsidian Workbench Build.png) | [Obsidian Workbench] |
| ![Key to the City](Key_to_the_City.png) | [Key to the City] |

## Crafting Tab in Don't Starve

There are 19 **Crafting Tabs** in **Don't Starve** and its **DLC**s for different **Items** and **Structures** that can be crafted.

| ![Tools](Icon Tools.png) | [Tools Tab] |

## Webber

'''Webber''' is one of the two playable [[Characters]] exclusive to the {{Giants|l}} DLC. He's the only one of the two that is not unlocked via [[Experience]]. He's also one of the playable Characters in [[Don't Starve Together|''Don't Starve Together'']]. Webber looks like a humanoid spider, though he's actually a child that was fused with a spider that tried to eat him. He received a character refresh exclusive to DST in June 2021.<ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/129647-dont-starve-together-return-of-them-eye-of-the-storm-now-available/] Posted on May 5, 2021.</ref>

{{#ev:youtube|https://youtu.be/h7XSEqWGxGI|alignment=left|dimensions=300}}

Webber's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled ''[[Animated Shorts and Trailers#Along Came A Spider|Along Came A Spider]]''. An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [[Compendium]]:

''Once upon a time, there was a young boy who lived with his family on a small farmstead. Though they lived humbly, the boy's home was filled with love, and he grew up happy and kind. The boy might have lived contentedly for the rest of his days if not for the sudden arrival of an old aquaintance[sic], who came to the house beseeching the boy's father for his expertise on a strange and secretive project...''

# {{Navbutton/Separation}}
## {{See also|Food}}
To see what type of the Food is, please refer to: [Food Type](#).

These "food values" measure how plentifully an ingredient can fulfill a recipe's need for certain food groups, plays in and **only** in [Crock Pot](#). Combined ingredients' food values (in addition to [#Priority|recipe priority]) are what determine an attempt's final dish; for example: [Honey Ham](#) requires a meat value greater than or equal to 2.0, so in addition to [Honey](#), its ingredients can be 3 Jerky; 2 Jerky & 1 filler; or 1 Jerky & 2 [Drumstick](#)s, but 1 Jerky, 1 Drumstick, & 1 filler won't cut it.

The overall set of food values for an attempted dish is the sum of its individual ingredient values. In attempting a dish like ![Monster Meat](#) ![Meat](#) ![Meat](#) ![Meat](#) ![Berries](#), the component values are:
- +1 meat, +1 monster
- +1 meat
- +1 meat
- +0.5 fruit

When added up, the final dish's set of values will be 3.0 meat, 1.0 monster, and 0.5 fruit. resulting in [Meaty Stew](#).

Some ingredients value for two food groups; for example: raw [Tropical Fish](#) provides 1.0 fish unit & 0.5 meat units (though [Cooked Fish Morsel](#) provides 0.5 fish units & no meat units).

## Meat value

There are 13 basic **Meat** [food](#) [items](#) in-game. There is one additional Meat in the **[Reign of Giants]** DLC, 11 additional Meats in the **[Shipwrecked]** DLC, two additional Meats in the **[Hamlet]** DLC, and eight additional Meats in **[Don't Starve Together]**. Most meats are dropped by [Mobs](#) as loot, and [fish](#) can also be obtained from [Pond](#)s with a [Fishing Rod](#). If a mob dies from burning, the cooked variant of meat will be dropped instead (if available). Many of the meats can be dried on a [Drying Rack](#), resulting in [Jerky](#), a much longer-lasting food item with different [Hunger](#), [Sanity](#), and [Health](#) bonuses.

Mobs such as [Pigs](#), [Spider](#)s or [Hound](#)s will eat any form of dropped meat on the ground, including [Pig Skin](#)s. Additionally, [Bunnymen](#) will be aggressive towards the player if they have any item on this list.

There are 10 [Crock Pot](#) recipes that require Meat. There are two additional recipes in the **Reign of Giants** DLC, four additional recipes in the **Shipwrecked** DLC, three additional recipes in the **Hamlet** DLC, and one additional recipe in **Don't Starve Together**. [Warly|Warly's](#) [Portable Crock Pot](#) also has a recipe that requires meat in **Don't Starve Together**. An [Egg](#) is counted as an egg in a Crock Pot, and as meat elsewhere. [Fishes](#) are counted as both fish and meat in a Crock Pot, and as meat elsewhere.

Different [Meats|Meat ingredients](#) have different meat values.

### Foods with meat value of 0.5
- ![Morsel](#) ![Cooked Morsel](#) ![Drumstick](#) ![Fried Drumstick](#) ![Frog Legs](#) ![Cooked Frog Legs](#) ![Small Jerky](#) ![Fish](#) ![Cooked Fish](#)![Cooked Eel](#) ![Eel](#) ![Moleworm](#) ![Shark Fin](#) ![Dead Dogfish](#) ![Raw Fish](#) ![Fish Steak](#) ![Tropical Fish](#) ![Purple Grouper](#) ![Cooked Purple Grouper](#) ![Pierrot

## Scrapbook Info
Used to mark a spot, and then used again to teleport to that spot. 8 minute cooldown. Even works between the Cave and the Forest.

The Backtrek Watch gives Wanda the ability to set a waypoint in space, and teleport to that spot at any time. The Watch has an 8 minute (1 day) cooldown, and is able to transport the player between shards (meaning between Surface and Cave in normal game). After the watch has been activated, the examination changes to "Is it time for us to take a dip in the timestream?" letting the player know whether or not a destination has already been set. Should the destination be set within a different shard (usually the Caves if you are within the Surface shard and vice versa), her examination will change to "It'll be a big jump, but I can make it!". It requires 2 Time Pieces, 2 Gold Nuggets and a Walrus Tusk to craft.

The Football Helmet is a wearable Armor, crafted in the Fight tab. It requires 1 Pig Skin and 1 Rope to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

It has a Durability of 450 and absorbs 80% of all physical damage. Not factoring the armor's durability, the Football Helmet effectively increases a player's hp to 750 for the average 150 hp survivor.

The Football Helmet can be given to a Pig or Bunnyman to wear to increase their HP by 450.

The Football Helmet may also be found in an Ornate Chest, which spawns in the Ruins.

## Downloadable Content

In the Reign of Giants, Shipwrecked and Hamlet DLCs, the Football Helmet provides 20% Wetness resistance.

In the Hamlet DLC, the Football Helmet is used to craft the Mant Mask.

## Usage

Recipe:
- item2: Chitin
- count2: 5
- item1: Football Helmet
- count1: 1
- result: Mant Mask
- tool: Science Machine
- dlc: Hamlet

## Tips

The Football Helmet is valuable, as it keeps the player protected without losing the Body slot for items such as a Backpack or an Insulated Pack so the player can be more efficient in collecting resources while staying safe. It is recommended to keep at least 1 Football Helmet with you just in case of a potential ambush.

## Trivia

- The Football Helmet was added in the The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You update.
- In American football, the football was once made out of animal leather and called a "pigskin".

The {{sanity}} Sanity icon, represented as a picture of a brain, is located near the character's {{hp}} Health and {{hunger}} Hunger. Characters can gain and lose sanity in various ways. A small animated arrow appears over the {{sanity}} icon, indicating an increase or decrease in Sanity. The size of the arrow signifies the rate of gain or loss.

As sanity decreases, the player's vision becomes shaky, over-saturated, and bright, whispers are heard, and [[Shadow Creature]]s start to appear. These creatures become "physical" and aggressive and will attack the player when their sanity is below 15%. When sanity is low, the player's character covers their ears and closes their eyes while rocking back and forth, as if experiencing a bad headache.

Being alone in the wilderness will take its toll. Generally speaking, being in close proximity to [[Monsters]], [[Darkness]], [[Rain]], eating bad or raw [[Food]], or using various magic items decreases sanity; while wearing certain [[Dress|clothing]], eating [[Jerky]] and [[Crock Pot]] food, being near friendly [[Pigs]], and [[sleeping]] increases sanity. See the Sanity Tables below for a complete list.

![Opened console in the game](Console.jpg)

## Console
Console is a developer interface in **Don't Starve** and **Don't Starve Together**. Players can open a console menu by pressing **~** (English/French), **^** or **ö** (German Keyboard Layout) **æ** or **ø** (Scandinavian Keyboard) or **ù** (Azerty Keyboard Layout) and "Ñ" in the Spanish Keyboard. It can be hidden again by pressing **Ctrl + L**. However, the feature must be enabled in the settings file located at the following location:

- **Windows, Mac:** `<Documents>\Klei\DoNotstarve\settings.ini`
- **Linux:** `~/.klei/DoNotStarve/settings.ini`

Opening settings.ini, players should make the following changes:

```ini
[MISC]
ENABLECONSOLE = true
```

If a player wishes to disable the console once it has been enabled, they will have to navigate to `\dont_starve\data\scripts\main.lua` and set the "CONSOLE_ENABLED" line to false.

The Portable Crock Pot is a character-specific Item that Warly begins the game with. It acts as a Crock Pot that can be moved and replaced. It must be placed on the ground to cook anything.

While cooking, the Portable Crock Pot gives just enough light to ward off Charlie, but the sanity drain is equivalent of staying in total darkness, therefore, this is not recommended. It can also make exclusive recipes.

## Recipes

## Trivia

- The Portable Crockpot was exclusive to the Shipwrecked DLC, until it was introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Warly Character Update.

## Bugs

- In Don't Starve: Shipwrecked, if the player places a Portable Crock Pot inside a Cargo Boat or Chester, exits the game and then relogs, a second Portable Crock Pot will appear in the player's inventory as the game considers the original one to be missing.
- The same bug will occur when the player enters a Cave without the Portable Crock Pot in the inventory. Relogging is not necessary for this to occur.

## Quotes

"Mmm...Smells good!" - Wormwood

## Overview

Wormwood is one of three Characters introduced in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. He appears to be an animate plant, akin to Treeguards, though he has a green cut stone on the front of his chest. Wormwood is friendly while a little eccentric, addressing things such as insects as "Bzzters" and birds as "Tweeters."

On June 6, 2019, Wormwood was added to Don't Starve Together as the second DLC character after Wortox. He is available to Hamlet owners on Steam for free. For all other players, Wormwood can be purchased either through the Wormwood Chest, which includes his Roseate skin set, or through the Wormwood Deluxe Chest, which includes the Roseate, Oasis Bound and Hollow skin sets. He can alternatively be woven with 2,700 Spools.

Wormwood has many unique abilities pertaining to Plants and plant-like Mobs, and he has access to unique crafting recipes that can help with healing and defense. He is able to plant Seeds without the use of a Farm, and he is treated neutrally by Mobs such as the Lureplant and Snaptooth Flytrap. He also seems to have some sort of kinship with plants, addressing most of them as "Friend," or things similar. Because of this, he loses Sanity when plants around him die, and he gains Sanity when he himself plants them.

Wormwood loses Sanity when plants within a five-tile radius are destroyed, even if the damage is not caused by him. Sanity effects from planting or destroying plants is reduced the further it happens from Wormwood.

## Origin

Wormwood's creation is shown in the animated short Lunar Roots. A green gem fell from the moon, landing on an ancient stone monument in the middle of overgrown rubble. Over a long period of time, a vine encircled the gem and eventually formed a humanoid figure sitting on the monument. The figure, Wormwood, opened his eyes and looked at his hands. He admired the tropical scenery, mimicking the flapping wings of the Butterflies with his leaf fingers. Trying to fit in, he imitated Parrots and Pogs, but he scared them off. Feeling downtrodden, he sat at the base of the monument and tucked himself under a nearby vine. He gave it a pat and smiled to himself. He went to sleep and bloomed along with the nearby plants while under the full moon.

## Trivia

- Wormwood was introduced in the February 7, 2019 Character update during the Hamlet DLC's Early Access phase.
- Wormwood's voice is a didgeridoo.
- Wormwood's quotes use the font Henny Penny and are green in color. He is the only character to have a unique font and text color.
- In Don't Starve Together the green color was replaced with white because text color is used in that game's chat system to differentiate

# Ice Cube

The Ice Cube is a craftable Dress Item from the Reign of Giants DLC. It requires 2 Electrical Doodads, 4 Rope, and 10 Ice to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

## Description
Science, on the rocks.

## Perks
- Prevents overheating in Summer or Dry Season.
- Increases wetness over time.
- Walking speed reduced by 10%.

## Crafting Recipe
- Ingredient 1: Electrical Doodad (x2)
- Ingredient 2: Rope (x4)
- Ingredient 3: Ice (x10)

## Tips
- Placing an Ice Cube in the Ice Box will completely stop it from melting.
- The Ice Cube is good addition to the Thermal Stone near the Endothermic Fire Pit and/or in the Ice Box for long trips during Summer.
- The Ice Cube will make inventory and equipped items Wet, causing Sanity loss. This can be used to become insane for farming Nightmare Fuel.
- Even with maximum wetness, Maxwell will not lose any sanity, making this hat rather valuable for him during summer. That being said, the faster food spoilage and slippery weapons are still large downsides to using the Ice Cube for extended periods of time.
- Dress Items with Wetness resistance, such as the Rain Coat, do not reduce wetness from the Ice Cube.
- While wearing the Ice Cube, being near a fire will slowly get rid of player wetness and will prevent the player and the player's items from becoming wet.
- It costs less Ice overall to just build a new Ice Cube than refueling an existing one with Ice, since the latter gives 0.8 days of durability per Ice instead of 0.4.
- Storing important items in the Piggyback will prevent them from becoming wet.
- Wurt does not lose sanity from the Ice Cube's Wetness.

## Trivia
- The description "Science, on the rocks." refers to the bartending terminology "On the rocks" for a drink served over ice cubes.

# Ancient Tab

![Ancient Tab Icon](Ancient_Pseudoscience_Station.png)

> "A solid piece of history." - Wilson

The **Ancient Tab** allows players to craft objects using the **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**, whether broken or repaired. Items under this tab cannot be "prototyped" and then made on the go in the future; to craft an item under this tab, the player must be near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station, regardless of how many times the item has been crafted. This tab can also be accessed with the **Brain of Thought**.

## Craftable Items and Structures

The following items and structures can be crafted in the Ancient Tab:

'''Woodie''' is the sixth playable [[Character]] unlocked via [[Experience]] in ''[[Don't Starve]]'', with 1600 XP. He is also one of the playable [[Character]]s in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' (DST). He is a stereotypical Canadian lumberjack with a love for chopping [[Trees]] and a mysterious curse.

In DST, he received a character refresh on September 12, 2019.<ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/109374-warly-is-now-available-in-dst/ Warly is Now Available in DST!]. Posted on July 25, 2019</ref><ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/111377-woodie-character-update-next-week-news/ Woodie Character Update Next Week + News!]. Posted on September 6, 2019</ref>

## Origin
{{#ev:youtube|https://youtu.be/d0r0WfV2y5s|alignment=left|dimensions=300}}
Woodie is notorious for having very little known about his character. His biography in DST's [[Compendium]] reveals a bit about himself:

''Hailing from the pine-covered mountains of the great white north, Woodie is an unassuming yet strangely mysterious man who keeps his past close to the vest (or in his case, the flannel). He is never seen without his signature bushy beard or trusty axe Lucy, who herself is a bit of an enigma. The other Survivors are not quite sure whether Woodie is simply mad, or if there might be something else to the seemingly inanimate object. Sometimes they swear they can hear a jovial female voice speaking to Woodie when no one else is around...''

In the animated short ''[[Animated shorts and trailers#Tree's A Crowd|Tree's A Crowd]]'', his DST exclusive forms Weremoose and Weregoose are given the spotlight. The short is officially summarized in the Compendium:

''As the power of the moon has grown, so too have the effects of Woodie's curse. Woodie soon found that his form would shift into not only the Werebeaver, but a Weremoose and Weregoose as well. As his changing forms became more unpredictable, Woodie resolved to find a way to have more control over his curse. Using every bit of knowledge he'd gained from his time in the Constant (and some additional tips from Ms. Wickerbottom) he soon discovered that his transformations could in fact be

# Health

**File:HealthMeter.png|thumb**

> "For documenting my pain." - Wendy

**Health** is a measurement of overall physical well-being. Unlike **Hunger** (and in many situations **Sanity**), Health typically does not drain over time. Health is lost instantly when a character is hit by an enemy attack, eats harmful food such as **Monster Meat**, eats **Rot**, or harvests from thorny plants like the **Spiky Bush**. In **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** (RoG), Health is lost instantly when harvesting from **Cacti**. Health is lost continually while the character is **burning**, **starving**, or **freezing**. In RoG, characters also lose Health while **overheating** and in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** (SW), while **poisoned**. Losing all Health results in **death** (although not necessarily the loss of the game). Health can be seen on the heart-shaped gauge in the upper-right corner of the screen, which shrivels and empties as the character's Health is depleted. Note that having a **Meat Effigy** lowers max Health. **Wanda** in DST does not have a health meter, instead, she has an age meter. Her meter corresponds approximately to 150 health.

* Wolfgang has 200 Health by default (his Health limit rises to 300 with a full belly and drops to 150 when starving). This is not true for **Don't Starve Together** as his health cap is only 200.

* WX-78 begins with 100 Health and is capable of increasing their Health Cap up to 400 by eating **Gears**. WX-78 begins 125 Health in **Don't Starve Together** and is capable of increasing their Health Cap by using **Hardy Circuit** and **Super-Hardy Circuit**s.

* Wilba's werepig form has 350 health.

* Wurt has 250 health when **King of the Merms** is alive.

**File:Slurtlethief.png|thumb|right|200px|Getting damaged depletes Health.**

## Healing

Health can be restored in a few ways. The most basic way to regain health is by eating **Food**, most of which typically provides 1-3 health when consumed. **Cooking** the food often increases the Health 1 or 2 points. There are also a few items whose sole purpose is to heal.

Wormwood is unable to gain health from eating food and must rely on other methods to restore it.

Certain food and items provide a greater health boost and are thus very valuable:

* **Crock Pot**: Several Crock Pot recipes provide substantial healing. **Fishsticks** [+40 hp] are an easy recipe to make. **Pierogi** [+40 hp] is a lot of people's go-to dish for its cheap recipe. **Dragonpie** [+40 hp] is excellent if the player manages to farm **Dragon Fruit**. In Shipwrecked, **Bisque** [+60 Hp] is food that can be easily produced, and is one of the most potent healing items in the game. However, regarding Crock Pot recipes in general, the player must make sure that the individual components (raw or cooked) won't heal more if eaten on their own.

* Cooked Crops: When cooked over a fire, **Eggplants**, **Potatoes**, **Dragon Fruit** and **Pomegranates** heal 20 hp.

* **Jerky**/**Small Jerky**: Jerky and Small Jerky restore 20 Hp and 8 Hp respectively and last for a very long time. If primary concern is health, and the player's only food source is **Meats**, they should be made into jerky. Jerky can be used in a **Crock Pot** as normal meat, if needed.

* **Spider Gland**/**Mosquito Sack**: **Spider

# Red Gem
The Red Gem is an Item used to craft several Magical items. It can be used to craft the Fire Staff, Night Light, Life Giving Amulet, and Purple Gem.

## Obtaining Red Gems
Red Gems can be obtained from Graves, as a drop from Red Hounds, from trading a Sextant to Wolly, from Earthquakes and Stalagmites in Caves, and from Ancient Statues, Broken Clockworks, and Ornate Chests in Ruins. They can also be found as a single, one time drop from hammering the Sunken Boat.

## Downloadable Content
### Reign of Giants
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Red Gems have a 0.02% chance to be dropped by Tumbleweeds.

### Shipwrecked
In the Shipwrecked DLC, Fishing with Trawl Net in deep Ocean has a small chance to catch a red gem. The chance is higher during Hurricane Season and Dry Season. Magma Piles in Magma Field biomes also have a chance to drop them.

### Hamlet
In Hamlet, Red Gems can be obtained by hammering A Smashing Pot, killing the Pugalisk, trawling in the Lily Ponds, finding them atop pedestals in Ancient Pig Ruins, and mining the Petrified Eggs in the BFB's nest.

## Usage

# Durability

Durability is a game-concept which limits the amount of usage an item or structure has. It generally applies to items which can be equipped, however there are some other items such as the [Sewing Kit] or [Pan Flute] which also have it. An item with durability can be identified by a percentage number in front of its inventory graphic. For example, an [Axe] will have a 100% over its icon when first created, and this number will change as the Axe is used. Different items use durability in different ways:

## Tools

[Tools] lose durability whenever they are used for their specific actions and in the same way as [weapons] do when attacking something. The 3 most common Tools ([Axe], [Pickaxe], and [Shovel]) also have special versions with a much higher durability ([Luxury Axe], [Opulent Pickaxe], and [Regal Shovel] respectively).

| Name | # of Uses | Special |
|------|-----------|---------|
| ![Axe] | 100 | Chops down [Evergreen|trees]. |
| ![Luxury Axe] | 400 | Chops down trees. |
| ![Pickaxe] | 33 | Mines [[:Category:Mineable Objects|mineable objects]]. |
| ![Opulent Pickaxe] | 132 | Mines mineable objects. |
| ![Shovel] | 25 | Digs up [[plants]]. |
| ![Regal Shovel] | 100 | Digs up plants. |
| ![Pitchfork] | 200 | Digs up [[turfs]]. |
| ![Hammer] | 75 | Deconstructs [[structures]]. |
| ![Sewing Kit] | 5 | Fixes up degraded clothing. |
| ![PickSlashAxe|Pick/Axe] | 400 as Axe (and weapon), 134 as Pickaxe | Chops trees and mines mineable objects. |
| ![Beefalo Horn] | 10 | Makes up to 5 [Beefalo] follow the player. |

## Survival items

[Survival] items lose durability when used by the player or when triggered by mobs. Some of them can be used as weapons but will lose durability much faster.

| Name | # of Uses | Special |
|------|-----------|---------|
| ![Bird Trap] | 8 | Captures [[Birds]]. |
| ![Trap] | 8 | Captures [[rabbit]]s and other small animals. |
| ![Fur Roll] | 3 | Restores [[sanity]] and [[health]] at the expense of [[hunger]]. |
| ![Tent] | 6 | Restores sanity and health at the expense of hunger. |
| ![Umbrella] | 20 (Only when attacking) | Prevents [[sanity]] loss from [[rain]]. |
| ![Bug Net] | 10 (4 when attacking) | Catches insects. |
| ![Fishing Rod] | 9 (3 when attacking) | Captures fish and eels in [[pond]]s. |
| ![Basic Farm] | 20 | Grows [[seeds]]. |
| ![Improved Farm] | 30 | Grows seeds faster. |

## Weapons

[Weapons] use Durability to determine the number of times they can hit something before breaking. A [Spear] for example losses 0.66% of its durability each time it is used to attack something, allowing it to be used 150 times. Each weapon has a different number of uses.

## Protection

Protective items include [Armor]s and [Walls]. Armors are items worn by the player. Armor's durability functions like extra [[Health]] for the character wearing it. Each type of Armor ([[Grass Suit]], [[Log Suit]], or [[Marble Suit]]) can absorb a certain amount of damage before breaking (225, 450, and 1050 respectively). When a character is hit, the armor takes a percentage of the total damage and the characters health takes the remainder. The number show on the armor's inventory icon is not actually the amount of damage it can still absorb, but the percentage of its own starting health (for example if a Grass Suit shows it has 50% durability left, it can still absorb 112 damage before breaking). Walls can be placed to protect or limit access to an area from other mobs. They can be attacked and destroyed, but can be repaired and even upgraded to last longer. [[Stone Wall]]s and [[Thulecite Wall]]s are the only non-flammable walls.

| Name | % Absorbed | Durability | Special |
|------|------------|-----------|---------|
| ![Hay Wall] | 100% | 50-100 | Flammable. |
| ![Wood Wall] | 100%

- **Links:** [Quotes](Wurt_quotes) / [Clothes](Wurt_clothes)
- **Sanity Multiplier (DST):** 

## Origin

Wurt is a Character exclusive to *Don't Starve Together*, who was released on October 24, 2019. Like Wortox, Wanda, and Wormwood, she needs to be unlocked, either by purchasing the Wurt Chest, Wurt Deluxe Chest, or Starter Pack addon to the Megapack Bundle or by weaving her with 2700 Spools. She is a young, curious Merm Guard.

Wurt's biography in the Compendium gives a bit of her backstory:

"Wurt is a little Merm girl who wants to bring her people back to their former glory (if they did indeed ever have a former glory... the evidence is a bit shaky on that front). A bit more open-minded than other Merms, she has taken to following the Survivors around and learning more about them. She is particularly fascinated by books with pretty pictures inside and an amazing thing the humans call "candy". Though she enjoys living in the swamp and being around other Merms, being the smallest and the youngest often makes her feel quite isolated, and she is enjoying the novelty of having some friends closer to her own age amongst the Survivors."

In the animated short "The Monster Marsh", an instance of her meeting the survivors is showcased. On a Hallowed Nights night, Wickerbottom reads a scary story to Webber and Wendy as they sit around a Fire Pit in the swamp. They are attacked by a mob of Merms, who trample through their camp as they give chase. Wurt follows them until she steps on Wickerbottom's book (which looks like the popular fairy tale "Hansel and Gretel"). She takes immediate interest in the story and sits at the base of a Spiky Tree as the survivors and Merms battle. After defeating the Merms and Spiders, a Tentacle takes them all out and one of their Candy Bags lands near Wurt. She helps herself to a piece of candy and continues to enjoy the book.

## Trivia

### In-Game

- Wurt's existence was accidentally leaked on October 12, 2019, when her Essential Wurt skin item was found in a Klei developer's Steam inventory.
- She has a unique idle animation in which she scratches one of her horns.
- When she was first implemented, she had many lines that implied she, like other Merms, could see in the dark. Most lines were later changed to remove reference to night vision. She will still say that she can "still see" when a Torch goes out, however.
- It was confirmed by Dan Sorce, a developer, that Wurt's voice is the combination of a sawtooth tone and the sound of gargling.
- Wurt's skull was found in the DST files as of May 6, 2021.
- Wurt's empowered appearance in her Toadstool costume is based on Misery Toadstool.
- The Victorian Wurt shows Wurt's transformation from a merm to a furry creature (apparently a goat). This is the opposite of what was shown in The Gorge event,

## Usage

The Telelocator Staff is a magical Item created from the Magic Tab. It requires a Shadow Manipulator to prototype, and costs 2 Living Logs, 4 Nightmare Fuel, and 2 Purple Gems to craft. The Telelocator Staff has 5 uses. Each use costs 50 Sanity.

- **Usage**: The Telelocator Staff is used to teleport the player or Mob (including Bosses) to a random location on the map. When used on a mob, Lightning will strike the mob where it was standing before being teleported (possibly setting it on fire). When used on the player, lightning will strike them at the location used and also at the location they are teleported to (potentially causing fires both times). Each use will increase world's moisture, that when high enough can start Rain.

- **Caves**: Using a Telelocator Staff in Caves will not teleport the target (even if a Telelocator Focus was built underground), but will cause Rocks and Gems to fall at the location where the spell was used (similar to an Earthquake). Note that falling Minerals can cause damage to players and mobs.

## Telelocator Focus

If the player built a Telelocator Focus in the world and stocked it with three Purple Gems, the Telelocator Staff will teleport its target to the point at which the focus is placed instead of to a random location. This consumes the gems.

The player can use the Telelocator Focus to teleport to a base after a long trip or quickly travel from one end of the world to another.

Note that since it is currently not possible to teleport to or within a cave, building one of these in a cave is just a waste of resources.

## Downloadable Content

- **Reign of Giants**: When using the Staff on a mob, lightning may strike the player instead. WX-78 will always be hit, even when standing next to a Lightning Rod (causing both the character and the rod to be struck).

- **Shipwrecked**: Mobs in the ocean cannot be teleported.

- **Hamlet**: The Pugalisk cannot be teleported.

# Wilson Percival Higgsbury

**The Gentleman Scientist**

## Character Overview

- **Image**: ![Wilson](Wilson.png)
- **Motto**: "I will conquer it all with the power of my MIND!"
- **Perk**: Grows a magnificent beard
- **Health**: 150
- **Hunger**: 150
- **Sanity**: 200
- **Spawn Code**: `wilson`
- **Birthday**: April 23
- **Survivability**: Slim
- **Favorite Food**: ![Bacon and Eggs](pic32|Bacon and Eggs)

## Origin

Wilson was the first of the playable characters to receive a backstory through an animated short, called **Forbidden Knowledge**. The events of this short were later officially summarized in DST's Compendium:

> While toiling away in his home laboratory late one night, Wilson was startled to hear a voice on the radio speaking directly to him. At first he feared he'd gone mad from too many late nights of experiments and accidentally-inhaled chemical fumes, but the voice assured him that it was no mere figment of the imagination. In fact, the voice had a proposition for him: if Wilson would build a machine according to their specifications, then he would be rewarded with secret knowledge, the likes of which no one had ever seen. Casting aside his better judgement (after all, what harm could come from making a vague bargain with a mysterious disembodied voice?) Wilson threw himself into constructing the machine. When at long last it was finally completed, the gentleman scientist had a moment of hesitation... a moment that might have saved him from his impending fate, had he been just a bit stronger of will. But at the voice's insistence, Wilson flipped the switch and activated his creation... and was never seen again. Well, at least not in this world.

## Trivia

### In-Game

- Wilson's voice is played by a "Harmon muted trumpet (mixed with some cup muted trumpet as well)".
- With a Puffy Vest, a Beefalo Hat, and the Beard at full length, Wilson can have the highest insulation factor in the game at 615.
- Wilson is one of the only three characters that get an insulation bonus from their Beard. The other two are Webber from Reign of Giants (RoG), and Woodie when played in DST.
- Wilson is the only character capable of producing Beard Hair from shaving. His Beard is also the only one to allegedly be made of human hair.
- Wilson is the only character unaffected by the Strange New Powers update, aside from Maxwell, who was not finished in time and got his new powers later on in the All's Well That Maxwell update.
- Wilson is the only character with no drawbacks. Even in RoG, his Beard needs to be grown to accelerate overheating in Summer, which is not required of Wilson during that season.
- Wilson has a skull in the game files.
- Before the November 14, 2013 patch, Wilson used to share a lot of examination quotes with the other characters. His quotes are also used as the default for every other playable character when new objects are implemented in a beta stage.
- Wilson can be used as a Steam chat emoticon.
- Team Fortress 2 promoted Don't Starve with a hat modeled after Wilson's hair, as well as a weapon based on the Ham Bat.
- When struck by Lightning in DLCs, Wilson, like most other characters, is shown to have bones in his hair.
- Due to the short "Inevitable," Wilson is one of the few characters to have received actual voice acting, along with Maxwell, Charlie, and Willow.
- Wilson with Shadow Courtier can see Ink Blight's names.
- The Mad Lab Shoes were only added on August 31, 2022, despite the fact that the full set became available a few years earlier. Those who bought any set of skins that included the Wilson’s Mad Scientist skin received a red chest with Mad Lab Shoes upon entering the game. The chest appeared before the player could open the daily gift. Mad Lab Shoes were added in update 520864.
- All skins in Halloween Costumes Sets reference one mob from the game. Wilson's is the Guardian Pig.

### Lore

- From June to July 2012, a series of blog posts featured field notes written in Wilson's point of view, in which he recorded his initial experiences building tools, encountering Beefalo, and creating Meat Effigies in The Constant.
- Kevin Forbes has described Wilson as "a person of independent means who has decided to apply his intellect, such as it is, to science," and has stated that despite identifying as one, Wilson is not a good scientist.
- Wilson's full name originates from promotional business cards Klei had made for a conference. Kevin Forbes originally wrote the name with Percival in

The Mad Scientist Lab is a craftable Structure introduced in the 2018 version of the event. It is found in the Prototypers & Stations Filter and Structures Filter and requires two Electrical Doodads and two Cut Stones to craft. It is always available to craft and does not require prototyping.

Standing next to the Mad Scientist Lab grants players access to the Mad Science Filter where they can conduct several experiments to produce potions. Each of these experiments causes the player to lose a certain amount of their Sanity.

Most of these experiments have several possible outcomes, however, they are all of positive effect for the players. As the cooking process takes a certain amount of time, their results are not immediately available for usage.

# Food

Food can be obtained by foraging, trapping, farming or hunting mobs. Food refills Hunger and may restore some Health along with Sanity, depending on the quality of the food eaten. Eating some foods, such as Monster Meat or Durians, can damage the player's health instead of restoring it. Some foods, such as raw Meat or Morsels, will damage a player's sanity if eaten. Mushrooms have varying effects on Health and Sanity depending on their color. Some special food items, such as Glow Berry, have additional effects when eaten.

Almost all raw food can be Cooked on a Campfire to increase the amount of Health/Hunger/Sanity restored or reduced, and sometimes remove Health/Sanity penalties from eating it. Some raw food items, most notably Meats, can be dried on a Drying Rack to produce long lasting food items with increased Health/Hunger/Sanity values. Additionally, a Crock Pot can be used for making foods that have additional benefits.

Food items also have other uses than eating them directly. Meat can be used as bait for carnivores, for the recruitment of Pigs, and as an offering to the Pig King for Gold Nuggets. A renewable way to gain Eggs is by giving meats to birds housed in Bird Cages. Meat is also a requirement to construct the Meat Effigy. Bunnymen can be befriended using Carrots and will become hostile if meat is in the player's inventory. Vegetables and Fruits can be used as bait for herbivores and given to Pigs to obtain Manure. Seeds can be used to bait Bird Traps.

Being of the most important items in the game, (and part of the game's namesake, to not starve) food is typically very valuable in any world; however, given the layouts of different maps and what spawns in them, food availability can vary from being abundant, to dangerously short. Food is affected by the seasons, which likely encourages the player to take advantages of seasonal diets and also take advantages of the food's shelf life.

With the introduction of Overheating mechanic in the Reign of Giants DLC (and carried over to Don't Starve Together and the Shipwrecked DLC), some foods are classified as hot or cold, providing an alternative way to combat Freezing and Overheating, respectively.

When players eat Foods that count as Meats, they will have a chewing animation and are not able to perform other actions for a relatively long duration. When eating Foods that are not Meats, they will just put it into their mouth very fast.

For Information on Food values and Priority, see the Crock Pot page.

| Yellow (21-49% Stale) | Restores 2/3 of Hunger, 1/3 of Health for a given food and doesn't restore any Sanity. |
| Red (0-20% Spoiled) | Restores 1/2 of Hunger for a given food, doesn't restore any Health and decreases Sanity by 10. |

The Antlion is a Mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in A New Reign. It appears in the Desert biome during Summer Season. The players can either appease or kill it, otherwise, it creates Sinkholes on the surface or Cave-in Boulder when a player goes inside the caves. The Antlion can be given a Thermal Stone at stage 1 to freeze it and start combat, or one at stages 4 or 5 to set it on fire and start combat. (If you want to use a hot thermal stone, you need to heat it by Antlion as it will loose heat instantly away from fire in summer, making this impractical)

## Behavior
Antlion first spawns in Summer when there is no rain and the ground is dry. 33 minutes and 36 seconds (roughly four days) after it spawns it will disturb the players unless tribute is paid to delay it. When the attack is complete, Antlion's disturbance timer will be set to 80% of the previous calm duration.

If it rains while the Antlion is Alive, it will despawn, respawning later with a reset timer at 33 minutes 36 seconds when the rain stops.

### Tribute
Players can contribute the following items to delay the Antlion's disturbance:

| **Days** | **Items** |
| --- | --- |
| 1/3 | Rocks, Egg, Second-hand Dentures, Bent Spork, Air Unfreshener, Leaky Teacup, Shoe Horn, Collected Dust |
| 2/3 | Melty Marbles, Gord's Knot, Tiny Rocketship, Ball and Cup, Frayed Yarn, Wire Hanger, White Bishop, Black Bishop, White Rook, Black Rook, White Knight, Black Knight, Gnome, Gnomette, Frazzled Wires, Lying Robot, Beaten Beater, Fake Kazoo, Toy Trojan Horse, Unbalanced Top |
| 1 | Cut Stone, Mismatched Buttons, Back Scratcher, Hardened Rubber Bung, Dessicated Tentacle, Lucky Cat Jar, Potato Cup |
| 2 | Thermbell, Red Crown |
| 3 | Beach Toy |
| 4 | Heat Stone Stage 2, Heat Stone Stage 3 |

For example, if one gives the Antlion an Egg, it would delay its attacks for 160 seconds, or 1/3 day. Giving the Antlion 10 Rocks will delay the disturbance timer by 3.3 days. One should keep

**Dense Turf** is a craftable **Turf** **Item** introduced in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as **Fire#Fuel**.

Dense Turf allows **Nettle Vine**s to grow and is also visually identical to the turfs found in the **Deep Rainforest** Biome. However, unlike the Deep Rainforest Turf, Dense Turf doesn't have randomly spawned jungle floor ferns that obstruct structure placement, shadows of leaves projected on the ground, a foliage effect on the sides of the screen, and it can be dug up with a **Pitchfork**.

**Grass Tuft**s planted on Dense Turf will grow into **Tall Grass** instead of normal one. Additionally, this turf allows **Cocooned Tree**s to convert regular **Rainforest Tree**s into cocooned ones.

When placed on the **Surface World** and covering a large enough area, no **Birds** will spawn and land on these turfs. In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, this Turf will not spawn **Flooding|Puddles**. Tides and expanding Puddles can still flood this turf, however.

## Trivia
- Dense Turf was added in the March 18, 2019 update.
- The fact that this soil is made with ash, and that when planting plants, they grow even higher level, can be a reference to the [terra preta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta) a soil made by the Brazilian natives with carbon ashes and organic waste that converted soils with poor mineral contents (jungle terrain) into farmland.

### '''Wendy Carter'''
Wendy Carter is the third playable [[Character]] in ''[[Don't Starve]]'' that can be unlocked via [[Experience]], with 640 XP, and one of the playable Characters in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' (DST). Wendy has a morbid personality; she always relates everything (even herself) to [[death]] and how depressing life is.

As part of the ''Don't Starve Together'' content updates, Wendy received a character refresh on March 19, 2020.<ref name="forumpost">[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/116359-wendys-character-refresh-is-coming-next-week/ Wendy's Character Refresh is Coming Next Week!] Posted on March 12, 2020.</ref>

{{#ev:youtube|https://youtu.be/7ozRwX35fHE|alignment=left|dimensions=300}}

A glimpse into Wendy and Abigail's pasts were shown in the animated short ''[[Animated shorts and trailers#Wish You Were Here|Wish You Were Here]]''. Wendy and Abigail Carter used to live near a cliff side overlooking the ocean. Under mysterious circumstances, Abigail died. As a result, Wendy became severely depressed. She started to dabble in spiritualism. The "Wendy's Nightstand" [[Vignettes|Vignette]] shows her diary, in which she related a strange dream where she could hear "the same song repeating over and over", thinking it was Abigail trying to communicate with her.

This information is also summarized in her biography entry of DST's [[Compendium]]:

''Wendy's tale of woe began with the untimely loss of her dear sister Abigail. Unable to accept the thought of life without her twin, Wendy began turning to the occult in the hopes of finding some way to communicate with the other side. After much trial and error, séance candles burned down to nubs and spirit boards thrown away in frustration, Wendy was nearly ready to give up and fall into despair... until finally, there was a sign.

The **Brush** is a craftable **Item** found in the **Tools Tab**. It requires 1 **Steel Wool**, 1 **Walrus Tusk** and 2 **Gold** to craft, and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. When used on a **Beefalo** one **Beefalo Wool** will be obtained, obedience level increased by 40% and domestication by 1.6% (domestication level only increases once per day).

## {{pic32|Prototype}} Tips
- The Brush can be used multiple times on the same Beefalo, but will only be beneficial the first time it is used per day. Thus, it should be used once per day on each Beefalo that is being tamed.
- Using a **Deconstruction Staff** will give back all the materials, enabling the creation of endless brushes with only 1 required Steel Wool.

## {{pic32|Placeholder}} Trivia
- The Brush was first introduced to **Don't Starve Together**. It was later added to **Don't Starve** in the **Don't Starve/Version History|Quality of Life** update.
- The Brush is considered to be part of **A New Reign**, even though it was introduced before the official start of the beta branch.

The Cat Cap is a Category:Hats Item in the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC. It is found in the Dress Tab, requires 1 Cat Tails and 4 Silk to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The Sewing Kit repairs 50% of its durability.

Cat Caps restore 3.3 Sanity/min while worn and are tier 1 warm clothing items, increasing the time a character can be without a fire during the Winter before Freezing. They have an insulation factor of 60.

Since Catcoons can easily go extinct on a map, and only drop their Cat Tails by chance, it is best to keep this Hat maintained with a Sewing Kit.

**Downloadable Content:**
Cat Caps are also included in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, however, they cannot be crafted. Instead, they can be bought for 10 Oincs at The Sow's Ear Hat Shop in the Pig City.

**Trivia:**
- Since Catcoon is a portmanteau of "cat " and "raccoon", this item is most likely based on the real life Wikipedia:Coonskin_cap|Coonskin Cap, made most famous by the frontiersman Wikipedia:Davy_Crockett|Davy Crockett. Wickerbottom's quote references this by saying "Not quite like Crockett's, but it'll do."
- Visually, the Cat Cap also resembles an Wikipedia:Ushanka|Ushanka Cap.
- In older versions of Reign of Giants, the Cat Cap had resistance to wetness and was dropped outright by killing Catcoons.

## Hunger

Hunger is one of the primary game mechanics, as it's the measurement which determines whether or not the character is starving. As a character gets hungrier, this meter will empty, and the stomach pictured will shrivel.

The default maximum hunger for characters is measured at 150, though many characters have different maximum hunger amounts:

- Wolfgang (300) (200)
- WX-78 (100-200) (125-200)
- Wes (113) (75)
- Wagstaff (225)
- Wigfrid (120)
- Webber (175)
- Walani (200)
- Warly (250)
- Wilbur (175)
- Wilba (200)
- Wortox (175)
- Wurt (200-250)
- Walter (110)
- Wanda (175)

Hunger drains at 9.375 points per minute or 75 points per game day, except for: 

- Walani, drain hunger 10% faster (10.3125 or 82.5)
- Warly, drain hunger 33% faster (11.25 or 99.75)
- Wilbur, drain hunger 33% faster (11.25 or 99.75) only when running on all fours
- Warly, drain hunger 20% faster (11.25 or 90)
- Wes (singleplayer only), drain hunger 25% faster (12.46875 or 93.75)
- Wormwood, drain hunger 0%, 33%, 66%, 100% faster (9.375, 11.25, 15.5625, 18.75 or 75, 99.75, 124.6, 150)
- Wormwood, drain hunger 0%, 6%, 13%, 20% faster (9.375, 9.9375, 10.59375, 11.25 or 75, 79.5, 84.75, 90)
- Wolfgang (singleplayer only), drain hunger from 0 to 200% faster (from 9.375 to 28.125 or from 75 to 225)
- Wilba in her Werepig form, drain hunger 400% faster (46.875 or 375)

Hunger drain can also be slowed or accelerated:

- To 60% of base rate by equipping a Belt of Hunger
- To 75% of base rate by wearing the Hibernation Vest
- To 80% of base rate by poisoning
- To 75% of base rate by equipping Funcap
- If a Slurper jumps onto the player it will start draining 3 points of hunger every 2 seconds and keep doing so, until it's detached from the head slot.
- Walter loses only half the normal hunger when Sleeping.
- Winona will drain 5 hunger when she speed-crafts something.
- Wolfgang has faster hunger drain when using the Mighty Gym.
- WX-78 has 20% slower hunger drain when using the Super-Gastrogain Circuit.

![Wilson hungry](Wilson_hungry.png)

When the Hunger meter is emptied, Health will begin to drain at 1.25 points per second until something is eaten or the character dies. Most food will restore the Hunger meter when eaten. The amount restored depends on the food eaten; cooked food typically restores more than raw food. Some

# Mobs

Mobs, or "Mobiles", are game entities which move around, technically creatures including Monsters and Animals. The term has been a part of video game jargon since 1978; it's not unique to Don't Starve.

Every Mob has its own unique behaviors, movements, attacks, drops, and uses. As such, learning the characteristics of each and every Mob becomes important to survival, done either through direct study and interaction or through external research.

Many mobs can be put to sleep by the pan flute and other features in the game.

## Classification

### Hostile Mobs
Hostile Mobs are always aggressive. These mobs attack anything nearby which they deem threatening.

### Neutral Mobs
Neutral Mobs are non-aggressive until provoked. Their threat is very often getting attacked, but it might be just about anything except proximity.

### Passive Mobs
Passive Mobs are always non-aggressive, even when attacked. These mobs will typically avoid the player, but exceptions exist.

These relationships are classified with regards to each others. A Mob which is hostile/neutral/passive towards all other Mobs is a true hostile/neutral/passive Mob.

For monstrous player characters (Webber and Wortox) some mobs are categorized differently. Bunnymen, Pigs and Catcoons will be hostile to them since these mobs attack monsters on sight, though Spiders will be neutral to Webber. Pigs will also be hostile to Wurt due to her being a Merm, but Bunnymen and Catcoons will be neutral.

## Characteristics

### Health (HP)
Health is measured in "Hit Points" (HP), an arbitrary unit invented to coordinate with damage.
Each hit taken from the player decreases its health by:
- attack damage * character damage multiplier
The number of hits required to kill a Mob is:
- Hits = mob health / attack damage

### Damage (DMG)
Damage is a subtraction of health from a Mob, measured in HP.
A hit against any Mob deals:
- attack damage = base attack damage / mob's armor

### Attack Period (AP)
The time from the start of one attack to the start of the next one, here measured in seconds.
A Mob's damage per second (or DPS) is calculated by either of the following
- DPS = total damage done / time taken
- DPS = attack damage / attack period

### Attack Range (AR)
The distance an attack can hit a target from, here measured in "units" which are equal to the horizontal thickness of a Wall, with the diagonal thickness of a Wall being √2 units.

### Sanity Aura (SA)
The amount of sanity a player gains or loses per minute when standing near the Mob.

### Walk Speed (WS) and Run Speed (RS)
Walk Speed is a mob's speed while idly wandering the world, and Run Speed is a mob's speed while either engaged in combat or fleeing. They are measured in units per second. The default Run Speed of most characters is 6.

The speed is affected by the mob's scaled size (determined by looking for inst.Transform:SetScale(X, X, X) in the mob's lua file), so the in-game speed is calculated as:
- WS/RS = speed * scale value

## Mob Interactions

This chart details the outcome of hostility if one mob is to meet another, the left vertical side of the column are the "spotters", and the straight horizontal side are the "spotted".
