# Axe

The Axe is a **Tool** that can be used to chop down **Trees**. It can be crafted at the beginning of the game with 1 **Twig** and 1 **Flint**. An Axe can also be used as a weapon, dealing 27.2 **Hp** damage on each hit. With either usage, an Axe has enough durability for 100 swings. When used to chop down Trees, Axe requires 5 chops for small, 10 for medium, and 15 for large Trees. Dead or burnt Trees require only one swing. Currently, the amount of chopping required is independent of the type of the Tree.

## Downloadable Content

In **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, Axes can be obtained from the **Slot Machine** and **Steamer Trunk**. Luxury Axes can be obtained from the Slot Machine and **X Marks the Spot** and by using a **Trawl Net** in the **Ocean**.

In **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, Axes can be bought for 5 **Oinc**s at the **Pigg and Pigglet's General Store** in the **Pig City**. Three of them are also required to craft the Pigg and Pigglet's General Store using the **Key to the City**.

### Scrapbook Info
"Well, A Rather Beautifully Intelligent System." Uses a complicated assortment of cogs and circuitry for computing.
Once a target has been selected, as long as it stays in range, the W.A.R.B.I.S. begins calculating optimal performance to fight the target.
The armor improves the wearer's speed as it analyzes the target, ending at a 30% speed boost.
When combined with the W.A.R.B.I.S. headgear, the two will sync up for a few moments sharing target information.

### Durability & Damage Absorption
- Durability: 730
- Absorbs 85% of all physical damage and a flat 5 Planar Damage.

### Speed Boost Analysis
| Stage | Time to reach | Speed Boost |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| 0     | Immediate     | +10%       |
| 1     | 10 seconds    | +15%       |
| 2     | 16 seconds    | +20%       |
| 3     | 20 seconds    | +30%       |

### Combination with W.A.R.B.I.S. Head Gear
The W.A.R.B.I.S. Armor can be combined with the W.A.R.B.I.S. Head Gear to get a damage boost in addition to the speed. The Head Gear will get synced with the current stage of the Armor within a few seconds, shown through waves at the top of the diagram, so the damage boost can be obtained without an additional analysis. When taking off the Armor or the Head Gear, the current state of the Analysis remains as long as the other is worn.

### Durability Repair
When the W.A.R.B.I.S. Armor's durability reaches 0%, it does not disappear; instead, it is unequipped and can no longer be equipped until repaired. It

## Description
Cave Lichen is a harvestable fungus found in the Ruins, commonly in the Wilds and occasionally Village Biomes. A small number can also be found in the Labyrinth near the Ancient Guardian. When harvested, it yields 1 Lichen and then takes 3-5 days to become harvestable again. It does not grow during Winter.

Cave Lichen cannot be relocated. They are flammable and will leave behind 1 Ashes when burned.

## Prototype Tips
Lichen counts as a vegetable and can easily be collected in large quantities facilitating certain Crock Pot recipes, due to the abundance of Cave Lichen in the Ruins.

## Trivia
Cave Lichen used to be green before it was changed in the Stuff of Nightmares update.

# Nightmare Lock

Don't Starve

## Object Infobox
- **Image**: Nightmare Lock.png
- **Spawn Code**: "maxwelllock"
- **Tool**: Divining Rod ![Divining Rod](32)
- **Biome**: Chess

## Quotes
- Wilson: Looks almost like a keyhole.
- Willow: Now I just need a key.
- Wolfgang: Scary lock!
- Wendy: Looks magical.
- WX78: KEY RECEPTACLE.
- Wickerbottom: Now I just need a key.

- Wheeler: Seems like the kind of thing I would want to unlock.
- Choose: Maxwell

The **Nightmare Lock** is a unique Adventure Mode structure used to trap the person sitting on the Nightmare Throne. It looks like a tiny version of the Wooden Thing with spikes surrounding it and can only be found at the epilogue of the Adventure Mode beside Maxwell. Also, a Divining Rod is required to unlock the lock. After unlocking, Maxwell (or whatever character was put there last) will be released, and the player's character will take his place on the Nightmare Throne. Back in Sandbox Mode, the player will become Maxwell (or whatever character was last on the throne) but will keep the items they had when they activated Maxwell's Door.

## Divining Rod Holder

- **Image**: Divining Rod Holder.png
- **Tool**: Divining Rod ![Divining Rod](32)

Divining Rod Holder is required for the final activation of the Teleportato in Adventure Mode.

---

## Trivia
- In older versions of the game, the Shadow Key (which shared the same model as a Purple Gem) was used to free Maxwell.
- If the player spawns a Nightmare Lock in a world and tries to unlock it with a Divining Rod, the game will crash.

# Downloadable Content

In all DLCs, Farms can catch on fire and burn down.

# Tips

- Improved Farms are more efficient for food production than Basic Farms, with twice the production speed and 1.5 times the number of harvests before requiring fertilization, while being only slightly more costly.
- As long as light is available to them, they can even grow crops in **Caves**. Any light source will do, even the light from multiple **Fireflies**.
- Since the crops do not spoil before harvesting, Farms can be used for a player's advantage to have a ready food supply for later, when food supplies may be rarer, such as during Winter.

# Trivia

- In **Don't Starve Together**, farming mechanics were overhauled in the **Reap What You Sow** update. The functionality of Farm Plots was replaced by and expanded upon with **Farm Soil**, a new type of turf produced by a **Garden Digamajig** and tilled with a **Garden Hoe** to grow **Plant Seeds**. With this update, Basic Farms and Improved Farms were no longer able to be crafted.

# Bugs

- If a farm catches fire while growing and is extinguished before burning, the farm will have a "cropless crop" where the leaves behind the fruit will open as if a harvest is ready, but with no

## Description

Evergreens are [[Plants]] generated randomly with each new [[map]] and can be naturally found anywhere except in [[Rockyland]] or [[Savanna]] [[Biomes]] (although they may still be planted there). Evergreens are most commonly found in [[Forest]]s and [[Grasslands]].

Trees are the primary source of [[Log]]s and [[Pine Cone]]s. They can be chopped down with an [[Axe]] or by [[Pig]] or [[Merm]] followers. A felled tree leaves behind a tree stump, which can be dug up with a [[Shovel]] for an extra Log.

Evergreens have a 4-stage life cycle (small, medium, large, and aged) which they continuously cycle through. The time for each stage to grow to the next one is, respectively, 0.625-1.25 days (5-10 min), 1.875-4.375 days (15-35 min), 1.875-4.375 days (15-35 min), and 0.3125-0.9375 days (2.5-7.5 min). Once cut, stumps do not regrow into trees nor do new trees spawn naturally; the only way to get more trees is to plant them with Pine Cones. Tree stumps, however, are treated as normal trees by the game: they are shown on the map as normal trees and they change their size from small to aging continuously like trees do. Planting a Pine Cone will produce a sapling tree which will grow into a small Evergreen in 0.3125-0.625 (2.5-5 min) day and follow the life cycle until it is chopped down or burned. The number of strikes needed to chop down a tree varies by its size and state

# Exclusivity: Don't Starve Together

## Meteor

### Object Info

- **Image**: ![Meteor](Image:Meteoralonediagonal.png)
- **Image Width**: 180px
- **Name**: Meteor
- **Renew**: Yes
- **Biome**: Rockylands
- **Spawns**: Moonrock Boulder, Smooth Meteor Boulder, Boulder
- **Spawn Code**: "shadowmeteor"

- **Wurt**: Weird rock.
- **Walter**: It came from outer space!
- **Wanda**: I never would have predicted I'd see a piece of the moon up close.
- **Choose**: Woodie
- **Source**: When examining a Moon Rock

### Description

A **Meteor** is an object that falls from the sky within **Rockyland** biomes near the **Mosaic** biome in **Don't Starve Together**. It can cause 50 damage to the **character** when it hits the ground. A Meteor's shadow grows larger as it becomes closer, making it possible to avoid being hit.

![Meteor Shadow](File:Meteor shadow.png)
![Moonrock Boulder](File:Moonrock Boulder.png)

When a Meteor crashes to the ground, the impact creates a crater, which looks like a dark scorch mark on the ground that fades away over time. If the Meteor isn't completely destroyed after the impact, it can drop some **Rocks**, **Flint** or leave behind a **Boulder** of the Rock, Flintless, or Meteor (or Moonrock) variant. A **Suspicious Boulder** may also be dropped from a Meteor once per world, from which a **Celestial Orb** can be mined. The Boulder can sometimes be partially destroyed, like those commonly seen in a **Desert** biome. The size of a crater depends on what is left behind. If the meteor was completely destroyed, leaving nothing behind, then the size of the crater will be small. If a Boulder was dropped, the size of the crater will be large.

On the main island, Meteor Showers are the only way of generating new **Moonrock Boulders** (or Meteor Boulders), acting as a renewable source of **Moon Rocks** on the surface. A small Meteor Shower will also trigger upon initiating the **Celestial Champion** fight after the **Lunar Siphonator** has been completed.

A meteor can act as an axe, shovel, pickaxe or hammer; a small meteor impact would equate to 1 swing from these tools to each object in the impact area, while a medium meteor would equate to 2 swings, and a large meteor would equate to 20 swings.

If a meteor collides with or near a structure, the structure will be destroyed. Some of the items used to craft the structure may be on the floor after the collision, but not all. Saplings or berry bushes damaged by a meteor usually leave behind the item version (such as after when dug with a **shovel**). If a meteor collides with a chest, all of the items inside will be thrown out (if hit many times, the chest will be destroyed, leaving boards behind). If a meteor collides with an item left on the ground, that item will be destroyed, leaving nothing behind. If a meteor collides with a tent that currently has a character sleeping inside, that character will immediately be woken up.

There is a second biome, besides the Mosaic, where meteor showers can spawn. This biome is partly Rockyland, and partly Grassland. The grassland typically has a very large number of berry bushes and other plants. The Rockyland section features boulders and usually includes Tallbird nests. This biome is not guaranteed to generate in every world; it merely has a chance of occurring. If this biome occurs in a world, the world will have two distinct areas that spawn meteor showers: one near the Mosaic biome, and one in the Rocky

Brambles are aggressive plants exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC.

They spawn during Lush Season in big lines, and can especially be found in the Rainforest, Deep Rainforest, Gas Rainforest, Plains, Painted, and Battleground biomes. They will not spawn or spread onto all crafted turfs. Due to these turf restrictions, they seem to avoid spawning in Lily Pond, Cultivated, and Pig City biomes.

They act as a wall, and prevent the player and most other Mobs from passing through (with the exception of Shadow Creatures).

A few days after Lush Season has started, Brambles will at random select to spawn. Out of all Brambles in the world, seven Bramble Blooms will select once to spawn. In the end of Lush Season, all Brambles will despawn within about 0-2 days.

If the player hits a Bramble in order to destroy it, it will damage the player 3 HP for each hit. Wormwood can avoid this damage by wearing the Bramble Husk. Using Ranged Weapons can also avoid the damage. When it is destroyed, other brambles in its line are destroyed along with it.

### Prototype Tips
* Bramble sites can be destroyed if the player builds a Structure or puts an item on it. One can also place crafted turfs to avoid them spawning.

The **Magic Flower** is a plant exclusive to the **Hamlet** DLC. It is created by planting **Magic Water** and will give off light as well as raise the player's sanity (roughly 0.6/second) in exchange for hunger (roughly -0.5/second) when they are standing close to it.

Similar to a **Meat Effigy**, the Magic Flower reduces max health when planted and will revive the player should they die. After resurrection, the player’s max health is returned and the flower is destroyed in the process. The Magic Flower can also be dug up with a **Shovel** to get the Magic Water and max health back.

## Prototype Tips
- The sanity and hunger drain auras from multiple Magic Flowers will stack. Care should be taken to avoid starvation as the player’s max health can become dangerously low depending on how many flowers are planted.

## Bugs
- Dying in a different world (any of the three DLC realms, as well as caves, ruins, and the volcano) and respawning from a Magic Flower that was placed inside any Hamlet DLC interior (Slanty Shanty etc.) will cause the player to be respawned out in the void of the world holding the respawn structure. It is recommended to use the command `c_warp("prefab")` to teleport the character back into the world, as walking back in can be problematic for world types such as Shipwrecked.

## Trivia
- According to Wickerbottom, the Magic Flower's species is **Narcissus poeticus**.
- The Magic Flower has unused animations for being hit or killed, though it functions much more like a plant than a mob in-game.

'''Seeds''' are a [[Food]] [[Item]] commonly left on the ground by [[Birds]]. While they can be eaten, Seeds are primarily used for [[Farming]] by planting them in a farm plot to grow crops. When planted, Seeds have a chance to grow into [[Corn]], [[Carrot]], [[Pumpkin]], [[Eggplant]], [[Pomegranate]], [[Durian]] or [[Dragon Fruit]] (''see [[Farming]] for further information''). Birds, [[Tallbirds]], [[Smallish Tallbird]]s, [[Smallbird]]s, and [[Pig]]s can eat Seeds and will pick Seeds up if they find them on the ground. Pigs that eat Seeds don't produce [[Manure]]. Seeds can be used to bait [[Bird Trap]]s.

In {{DS}}, when the temperature is 0 or below (which currently only happens during [[Winter]]), Seeds that have been planted will stop growing and cannot be forced to grow via [[Fertilizer]].

# Walrus Camp

## Overview
A **Walrus Camp** (or Igloo) is a naturally generated and indestructible structure that spawns [[MacTusk]], [[Wee MacTusk]], and [[Hound#Blue Hound|Blue Hounds]]. It's used as a base by these [[Mob]]s, known collectively as the [[Mactusk N' Son|MacTusk 'n' Son Scottish Nobleman Walrus Hunting Party]]. The Walrus Camp will only spawn mobs during [[Winter]]. Walrus Camps will spawn on all terrain, except [[Marsh|Marsh Biomes]]. The igloo often appears near [[Maxwell's Door]], and two or more will often spawn in a close vicinity to each other. The MacTusk Hunting Party will spawn about every 2.5-3 [[day]]s from a fully functioning Walrus Camp.

## Quotes
- **wolfgang:** How do they all fit?
- **wilson:** It looks warm and cozy inside.
- **willow:** Why does everyone have a nicer house than me?
- **woodie:** Walruses are nearby, eh?
- **maxwell:** The Walrusser can't be far.
- **wagstaff:** A dome shelter. Is a walrus capable of constructing that?
- **wendy:** This home is not a happy one, I fear.
- **woodlegs:** Campin's fer landlubbers.
- **wickerbottom:** Some kind of temporary habitation.
- **webber:** Maybe they'll invite us in?
- **warly:** Some outdoorsy types made this.
- **wx78:** I HEAR A FAINT OORKING
- **walani:** Sweet digs.
- **wigfrid:** A pröper winter camp.
- **wilba:** 'TIS FULL O' BIG-TOOTH UNPIGS
- **wormwood:** Ball of home
- **wheeler:** How adorable. They think they're people!
- **choose:** willow

## Empty Walrus Camp
When it's not Winter, an inactive Walrus Camp is a big dark brown circle on the ground, which can be walked over. Regardless of the season, the Walrus Camp appears as an igloo on the map.

## Strategy: Tentacle Spike
To kill [[MacTusk]] without taking too much damage, chase [[MacTusk]] far enough to the point where it will ignore the player and attempt to walk back to its home. It will continue to walk even if being hit by the player. Since the [[Blue Hounds]] are closer to [[Wee MacTusk]] and being too far from home, the player will be able to kill [[MacTusk]] without much trouble. After the kill, simply go back and finish off the [[Blue Hounds]].

Another way that works only once (before resetting) is to place [[Tooth Trap]]s and [[Bee Mine]]s in the area in front of the igloo where the hunting party will come out. A row of four Bee Mines and a few Tooth Traps around them is enough to take down the party.

Furthermore, as [[Wendy]], using a riled up [[Abigail]] to take the [[Hound|Hounds]] out while taking hits from [[MacTusk]] can be a viable strategy. Abigail can even outrun both [[MacTusk]] and [[Wee MacTusk]] while she stuns them upon dealing damage, making quick work of them without too much trouble.

## Farming
Since Walrus Camps keep respawning the party, it's possible to trap them or kill them as they spawn. One of the best ways is to build 3 or 4 [[Pig House]]s and make the [[Pigs]] fight the walruses and hounds. However, Pigs will only attack the hounds but not the 2 walruses unless provoked. It is advisable to make this during summer since these mobs are not around. A player can use a Hammer to smash a single wall to get the loot inside (as shown in Gallery) after the Pigs have killed the Hunting Party. Be warned that the player will not get meat drops since the surviving Pigs will eat the meat on sight.

If playing as [[Wickerbottom]], one method of farming can be using one of her [[Books]] "On Tentacles" to summon three [[Tentacles]] around the Camp. Then enclose it with walls in a tight space and make sure that the area is passable. There must be no single "exits" so that [[MacTusk]] and [[WeeTusk|Wee MacTusk]] have no chance of running away. This should preferably be done when it is not winter, so the Party is not present.

# Berry Bushes

Berry Bushes are **Plants** commonly found in **Grasslands** and occasionally **Forests**. They can be harvested to receive 1 **Berries**, after which they will need from 3 to 5 **Days** to regrow (**Rain** will reduce this time). Berry Bushes can be dug up with a **Shovel** and replanted in a new location. Doing this will require the bush to be **fertilized** before it will regrow any new Berries. If the player tries to dig up a Berry Bush without fertilizing it, it will result in 2 **Twigs** and the bush's destruction.

## Characteristics

- **Tool**: Can be dug with a **Shovel** (![Shovel](Shovel.png))
- **Picked**: Can be picked (![Berries](Berries.png))
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Resources**: ![Berry Bush Item](Berry_Bush_Item.png) and ![Berry Bush 2](Berry_Bush_2.png)<br>![Twigs](Twigs.png) (from Shovel on barren)
- **Renew**: Yes 
- **Biome**: **Grassland** and **Forest**
- **Spawn Code**: "berrybush" and "berrybush2"
- **Spawns**: ![Gobbler](Gobbler.png)

## Exclusivity

## Description

- **Scrapbook Description**: This needs some fertilizing after planting.
- **Stack**: 10
- **Burn Time**: 3 minutes.
- **Perk**: Can be replanted
- **Dropped By**: ![Berry Bush](Berry_Bush.png) and ![Berry Bush2](Berry_Bush2.png)
- **Spawn Code**: "dug_berrybush" and "dug_berrybush2"

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: Red berries taste the best.
- **Willow**: Mmmmm. Berries.
- **Wolfgang**: Is full of food-balls!
- **Wendy**: A snack perchance?
- **WX-78**: PERIODIC CALORIE DISPENSOR
- **Wickerbottom**: It's an Ardisia crenata bush.
- **Woodie**: Saskastoon berries?
- **Maxwell**: Reduced to eating berries. Sigh.
- **Wagstaff**: I detect a slight smell of primrose.
- **Wigfrid**: A fruit bush.
- **Webber**: Ripe for the pickin'.
- **Walani**: Awesome! That bush has berries!
- **Warly**: Berries!

- **Wortox**: Mortals say they're sweet to eat.
- **Wurt**: Snacks!
- **Walter**: Foraging is an important wilderness skill!
- **Wanda**: Aha! A ready supply of food!

## Tips

- A character with default hunger modifier needs 75 points of hunger per day, one cooked berries is 12.5 hunger, and at most berry bushes require 5 days to regrow, one may need (75 / (12.5 / 5) = 30) roughly 30 berry bushes to fully self sustain hunger off of berries alone.
- Allowing Roasted Berries to become Rot on the ground can be a quick source of fertilizer to renew the bushes themselves.
- Dropping a single berry in the middle of many berry bushes/a berry bush farm immediately attracts any gobblers that spawn, causing them to ignore attacks from the player allowing for easy dealing of gobblers.
- Berry Bushes can be transplanted to grow within the **Ruins**, making them an excellent food source.
- Planting Berry Bushes near one's base can make harvesting faster and less time-consuming.
- Planting lots

## Scrapbook Info

Creates a Polar Light.

## Description

The Moon Caller's Staff is a Don't Starve Together exclusive item, introduced in A New Reign. It acts similarly to the Star Caller's Staff, with the difference of having 50 uses and creating a Polar Light, that lasts 2 Days and cools the players down, as opposed to warming them like the Dwarf Star. If a Deconstruction Staff is used to break this staff, it will drop 4 Nightmare Fuel, 2 Living Logs and an Iridescent Gem.

The Moon Caller's Staff cannot be crafted. Instead, one must place a Star Caller's Staff on a Moon Stone during a Full Moon, after which it will immediately start turning into a Moon Caller's Staff. Two complete time segments (60 seconds) are needed for the transformation to be completed. Also note that this will also start spawning multiple Werepigs and Hounds which will automatically target the Moon Stone and attempt to destroy it in order to stop the transformation progress. Using a nearly depleted Star Caller's Staff will still create a Moon Caller's Staff at full Durability. Creating a Moon Caller's staff in this way, and subsequently using a Deconstruction Staff on it, is the only way to obtain a third Iridescent Gem to place in the Archive Switch besides using Wilson's alchemy.

A Moon Caller's Staff left in a Moon Stone will constantly generate chilling Polar Light with no added wear on the staff. Haunting a Moon Caller's Staff has a chance to activate it.

### Description
Lawn Turf is a craftable Turf Item exclusive to the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. It requires 2 Cut Grass and 1 Nitre to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as fuel.

### Natural Spawning
The Lawn Turf spawns naturally as part of several Set Pieces in the Pig City. These are often surrounded with Hedges and Intricate Topiary.

### Surface World Effects
When placed on the Surface World covering a large enough area, no Birds will spawn and land on these turfs. This turf prevents BFB from landing.

### Shipwrecked DLC
In the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC, this Turf will not spawn Puddles. Expanding Puddles can still flood this turf, however.

## Analysis
| Stage | Time to reach | Damage Boost |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| 0     | Immediate    | +5%         |
| 1     | 10 seconds   | +10%        |
| 2     | 16 seconds   | +15%        |
| 3     | 20 seconds   | +20%        |

## Tips
- **Due to gaining damage over time when fighting a single target, the helmet is extremely useful against Boss Monsters, especially those that do not summon minions.**
- **Due to requiring an Enlightened Shard, if the first Enlightened Crown is not deconstructed, players would have to fight the Celestial Champion again to obtain this helmet. The same also applies to the Armor.**

# Tallbird Nest

The **Tallbird Nest** is a naturally occurring object that randomly spawns in **Rockyland** biomes. Tallbirds will also spawn with nests (one Tallbird per nest) and will lay **Tallbird Eggs** there.

## Characteristics

- **Flammable**: Yes, can be burned.
- **Picked**: Can be picked ([Tallbird Egg](#)).
- **Image Gallery**:
  - ![Empty](Tallbird_Nest.png)
  - ![Full](Tallbird_Nest_Full.png)
- **Renew**: No, does not renew.
- **Biomes**: **Rockyland** and **Magma Field**.
- **Spawn Code**: "tallbirdnest"
- **Spawns**: ![Tallbird](#)

## Behavior

- The Egg can be taken from the nest, which will anger the owning Tallbird and make it chase the player. The Tallbird will lay another one after 3-5 days, and if killed, the Tallbird will respawn in 2.5 days.
- The Egg can hatch into an adult Tallbird if it is unharvested and the parent Tallbird is dead.
- At dusk, Tallbirds return to their nests to sleep, though they will wake up if anyone goes near them for a short duration or takes their Eggs.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, Tallbird Nests can be found rarely in the **Magma Field** biome.

## Tips

- Players should be careful when using fire around Tallbird nests as they are flammable and do not respawn if destroyed (except in **Don't Starve Together**).
- One must be prepared to kill or run away from the Tallbird after taking its egg, as it will pursue for a very long time.
  - If the player jumps into a **Wormhole**, the Tallbird cannot follow, making it easy to steal their Egg this way.

## Trivia

- According to **Maxwell**, Tallbird Nests are made out of **Beefalo Wool**: "It's made of dirty beefalo hair."

# Cawnival Games

The **Cawnival Games** are the games that are only available in the **Midsummer Cawnival**.

Only one snack can be given to a Crow Kid at a time, with the player having to wait (1 hour for Popcorn, 12 minutes for Corny Slush) before being able to give the same Crow Kid another one.

## Description
Nasty Spear Traps are traps exclusive to the *Don't Starve: Hamlet* DLC. They are found within Ancient Pig Ruins and activate periodically when a Mob or player is in close proximity, or by pressure plates. If the pressure plate spawned with an item on it, the traps will activate when the item is taken; otherwise, they activate when the pressure plate is stepped on or weighed down. In addition to damaging anything that is on top of them when they activate, Nasty Spear Traps act as a wall and prevent the player and most other Mobs from passing through (except Shadow Creatures). Nasty Spear Traps can be destroyed using Weapons, or instantaneously using Shears. Doing so will cause them to become Broken Spear Traps. They are not currently known to regenerate.

## Tips
- A Ham Bat can be used to destroy Nasty Spear Traps at no cost of weapon durability.
- A Torch can be used to destroy many activated Nasty Spear Traps at once at minimal cost.

*Winter's Feast*

## Quotes
- Wilson: "A feastival table."
- Willow: "Are we having company?"
- Wolfgang: "Is place for all of Wolfgang's friends!"
- Wendy: "A table for gatherings."
- WX-78: "IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR FEASTING"

- Wurt: "Is very fancy table."
- Walter: "The table's all set and ready for food!"
- Wanda: "An empty table isn't really much to look at."

## Scrapbook Info
- Only special Winter's Feast dishes can be placed on this table.
- When the "food" on this table is "eaten" it gives a Winter's Cheer buff to the survivor.
- The buff heals the survivor 0.5 Health per second, 10 Sanity per minute and 75 Hunger per day as well as halting the regular hunger drain.
- The buff's duration is based on how grand the feast is. More tables connected together, more survivors feasting together and a varied number of dishes will increase the duration of the buff.

## Buff Duration and Effects
| Dish | Number of Players Feasting | Duration | HP | Sanity | Hunger |
|------|----------------------------|----------|-----|--------|--------|
| Duplicated dish | Independent | 48s | 24 | 8 | 15 |
| New type | 1 player | 72s | 36 | 12 | 22 |
| New type | 2 players | 88s | 44 | 14 | 27 |
| New type | 3 players | 100s | 50 | 16 | 31 |
| New type | 4 players | 109s | 54 | 18 | 34 |
| New type | 5 players | 116s | 58 | 19 | 36 |
| New type | 6 players | 123s | 61 | 20 | 38 |
| New type | 7 players | 129s | 64 | 21 | 40 |
| New type | 8 players | 134s | 67 | 22 | 41 |

## Detailed Formula
The total duration of the buff starting from the beginning of the feast is given by (in sec):
\[ \text{Duration} = 7 + \text{time} \times [1.2 \times (\text{#type}) \times (\text{#player})^{0.3} + 0.8 \times (\text{#dish} - \text{#type})] \]
where time is the duration of the feasting in seconds, #type is the number of different dishes on all connected tables, #player is the number of players feasting, and #dish is the total number of dishes.

## Description
Birchnut Trees are Plants found in the Reign of Giants DLC. They are found mainly in Grasslands and frequently in Deciduous Forests. When chopped, they will yield 1-3 Logs and up to 2 Birchnuts, depending on the season.

If cut in its prime (the largest form), it will yield 2 Birchnuts in Autumn (colored leaves), 1 in Spring and Summer (green leaves), and no Birchnuts in Winter (leafless). Standing under one offers moderate wetness protection from Rain and slows Overheating.

## Downloadable Content
In the Shipwrecked DLC and Hamlet DLC, Birchnut Trees will not gain colored leaves in any of the seasons, and neither will they lose their leaves.

## Tips
- It is best to chop down Birchnut Trees in Autumn, since they drop an extra Birchnut, which means the player can more efficiently make a Birchnut Tree farm, or plant one Birchnut and use the other for a Trail Mix.

## Trivia
- The name "Birchnut" is a portmanteau of the words "birch" and "chestnut".
- Birchnuts also look similar to chestnuts, and the bark of the Birchnut tree looks similar to that of the birch tree.
- It may also be a pun on "beechnuts", the fruit and seeds of the beech tree. Wickerbottom says the species belongs in Fagales, which is the taxonomic order that includes beeches, chestnuts, and birches.
- In the first version of Reign of Giants, Birchnut Trees were simply named "Deciduous Trees". It's still named as such in the game's files.
- Pigs, and other mobs that are able to smash structures, are the only mobs that can destroy Poison Birchnut Trees.
- Despite having white bark, these trees drop normal logs with brown bark.
- During Autumn, the tree's leaves will change colors (red, brown, or orange) and can be seen falling off. This mimics real world deciduous tree color changes in the fall or autumn.
- Wilson's quote upon examination of a Birchnut Tree is different from what he would say about an Evergreen ("It's all Leafy. Most of the time." compared to "It's all Piney.").
- Birchnut Trees resemble the truffula trees from The Lorax by Dr. Seuss.

## Bugs
- If the player survives a night near the limits of the tree's attack range, there is a slight possibility that

## Usage

To dig up an **item** with the Shovel, right-click it from the inventory to equip it and right-click on the object. The player will dig up the object, and an item will appear on the ground.

Shovels can be used to dig up **Plants** such as **Berry Bush**es, **Grass**, and **Sapling**s in order to replant them in a more desirable location (usually closer to a base camp).

Shovels can also uproot Tree stumps for 1 **Log**, regardless of their size, and chopped **Mushtrees**, also for 1 Log. They can dig up **Rabbit Hole**s, but doing so will permanently remove the hole and prevent any more rabbits from spawning at that particular spot. Additionally, the Shovel can be used to dig up **Grave**s to acquire **Gravedigger Items** at the cost of -10 **Sanity** per Grave dug.

The digging animation for the Shovel can be cut short by moving after the player digs up anything. This speeds up the process of mass-clearing objects when holding spacebar.

## Trivia

* The Shovel was added in the **Turf!** update. Shovels were previously used to dig up **Turfs**, but this is now done by the **Pitchfork**.
* The Shovel used to cost 30 **Science Points** to craft and had a value of 1-10 Science Points, depending on its durability, while the Regal Shovel used to cost 200 Science Points to craft and had a value of 1-35 Science Points.
