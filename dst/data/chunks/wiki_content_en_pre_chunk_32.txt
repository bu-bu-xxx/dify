## In-Game Usage
When used, it puts out nearby **Fires** and reduces **Overheating** body temperature of the player by 50°, potentially causing the player to start **Freezing** if their temperature is low enough and fully dries all the characters nearby. However, it will never reduce the temperature below 2.5° in the **Shipwrecked** DLC.

## Don't Starve Together
In **Don't Starve Together**, the Luxury Fan will cool down all nearby players when used. Additionally, it will never reduce the temperature below 2.5°.

## Skins
In **Don't Starve Together**, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the **Belongings** page.

- **Woven - Elegant Flamboyant Fan** skin was introduced during the official **Year of the Carrat** event in 2020.
  - ![Flamboyant Fan Icon](Flamboyant_Fan_Icon.png) **Woven - Elegant Flamboyant Fan**: "Everyone will be blown away by this fancy feathered fan." ![See ingame](Flamboyant_Fan_Wilson.png)

## Trivia
- The Luxury Fan used to be called the "Down Thermantidote" and was directly dropped by the Moose/Goose.
  - Thermantidote is a portmanteau of the words "Thermal" and "Antidote".

The **Second Chance Watch** is a Character-specific Item which can be used to resurrect dead players. It can only be crafted by Wanda in Healing Filter and Survivor Items Filter. It requires 1 Time Pieces, 2 Living Log, and 4 Bone Shards to craft. If Wanda dies while having the watch in the inventory (not in a Backpack), it will drop on the ground for her to haunt. Haunting the Second Chance Watch will break it, giving back half of the materials used to craft it, including the Time Pieces. Only ghosts of Wanda players can haunt the watch to resurrect themselves. Wanda can also use it to revive Ghost Players, setting the watch on a 4-minute cooldown instead of destroying it. Players resurrected via a Second Chance Watch will be teleported to the place they died and will have the same stat penalty as a Life Giving Amulet.

### Trivia
- It is the only clock that drops from Wanda's body when she dies. All others will stay on her body, and she will have them when she respawns.
- Wendy and WX-78 are the only characters with differing lines compared to the other watches; all characters except for them have the same examination line for the Ageless Watch.
- Since the reviving point does not move with boats, being resurrected via the Second Chance Watch after dying on a boat that has been moved or destroyed causes the player to respawn on water and drown immediately.
- If a player died in a dangerous place, reviving them before clearing out the threats will usually result in dying again.
- Wanda cannot use a Second Chance Watch on Abigail.

- **Wheeler:** An adventuring hat, if I've ever seen one.
- **Choose:** Webber

The **Swashy Hat** is a loot **[Hat](#)** **[Item](#)** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It is acquired after killing the **Masked Pig**.

The Swashy Hat allows the player to "sneak" around normally hostile mobs without being attacked. This only works if the player keeps a certain distance from the mob, as getting closer will instigate an attack as normal. Being close to **Royal Guards** will draw instant aggression, but if the player returns to the same Guards without wearing the Swashy Hat, they will not attack the player.

Another benefit to the Swashy Hat is it allows the player to steal from **Farmer Pigs** and **Miner Pigs** in the **Suburbs** areas found on the outskirts of town without antagonizing the Royal Guards or causing panic. However, this feature only works during the **Dusk** and **Night** phase of the day. It should also be noted that during Dusk and Night the Guards will not assail the player for wearing this hat unless the player is within melee range. This is likely to prevent the player from being attacked immediately after picking it up, as it is equipped automatically unless something else is blocking the head slot already.

# Thermal Stone

The '''Thermal Stone''', also known as '''Heat Stone''', is a [[Survival]] item in ''[[Don't Starve]]''. It requires an [[Alchemy Engine]] to prototype and costs 10 [[Stone]], 1 [[Pickaxe]], and 3 [[Flint]] to craft. Its purpose is to delay body temperature change, preventing the player from [[Freezing]] in [[Winter]] as well as [[Overheating]] in [[Summer]] ([[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|RoG]]).

## Mechanics

A Thermal Stone acts as a heat source with an internal temperature between -20° and +90°. With the thermal stone in the inventory, the player's own body will attempt to reach a temperature given by the formula:
\[T_b = \frac{T_a + 2.1 \times T_h}{3.1}\]
where \(T_b\) is the target body temperature, \(T_a\) is the ambient temperature, and \(T_h\) is the temperature of the thermal stone. This formula means that both \(T_a\) and \(T_b\) are considered, only \(T_h\) is given 2.1 times the importance.

If the stone is on the ground instead, the target body temperature is instead given by:
\[T_b = \frac{T_a + T_h}{2}\]
which is simply the average (midpoint) between the ambient temperature and the thermal stone's temperature.

The temperature of a heated thermal Stone drops at a rate determined by 120 insulation, which is 1 degree every 5 seconds. This insulation is only used for determining the stone's own temperature loss and does not affect the player.

Cold Thermal Stones can be used in the [[Summer]] or [[Dry Season]] to prevent [[Overheating]]. A Thermal Stone can be cooled by placing it next to an [[Endothermic Fire]], in an [[Ice Box]], or in [[Snow Chester]]. Thermal Stones placed in Snow Chester will cool at half the rate that they would in an ice box.

While carried in any [[Backpack]], including the [[Insulated Pack]], Thermal Stones can still affect the player's temperature.

Can steal Thermal Stones, so caution must be taken, especially around [[Deciduous Forest]] biomes. Thermal Stones no longer emit light.

## Thermal Stone in Don't Starve Together

The Thermal Stone in ''Don't Starve Together'' has some differences from Singleplayer and its DLCs:
- Every time the Thermal Stone goes from Freezing White or Glowing Red to Gray, the Thermal Stone loses 12.5% of its durability. It can, however, be repaired with a [[Sewing Kit]], one use of which will fully repair it.
- A level 5 or Glowing Red Thermal Stone can emit enough light to ward off Charlie.
- Thermal Stones stored in Snow Chester will cool at the same rate of an Ice Box. Blue and gray Thermal Stones can be given to the [[Antlion]] to appease it, delaying its rage by 2.98 days. When offered white, yellow or red Thermal Stones it will become enraged.

## Temperature Stages

The stage of the thermal stone is determined relative to the ambient temperature and each stage emits a fixed temperature:

| Stage | Internal Temperature |
|-------|----------------------|
| ![Heat Stone Stage 1](Heat Stone Stage 1.png) | more than 30° below ambient temperature |
| ![Heat Stone Stage 2](Heat Stone Stage 2.png) | between 30° and 10° below ambient temperature |
| ![Thermal Stone](Thermal Stone.png) | between 10° below and 10° above ambient temperature |
| ![Heat Stone Stage 4](Heat Stone Stage 4.png) | between 10° and 30° above ambient temperature |
| ![Heat Stone Stage 5](Heat Stone Stage 5.png) | more than 30° above ambient temperature |

## Usage

{{Recipe
| item1 = Thermal Stone
| count1 = 1
| item2 = Papyrus
| count2 = 2
| tool = Bookcase
| result = Tempering Temperatures
| character = Wickerbottom}}

## Skins

- The '''<span style="color:#92B45F;">Loyal</span> Metamorphosed Flame''' skin was awarded for watching 6 hours of ''Don't Starve Together'' on Twitch from May 9, 2019 to July 25, 2019, and from January 7, 2021 to January 14, 2021. It is also available in the Klei Rewards shop for 1,200 Klei points.

# Books in Don't Starve

## Tips

- Pew-matic Horn can be used to easily kill mobs that run away from the player, kite the player or cannot move. Those include Birds, Koalefant, Krampus, Pigs, Mermen, Eyeplants, MacTusks, Tentacles, Big Tentacles, Moslings, Crabbits, Dogfish, Dragoons, Fishermerms, Floaty Boaty Knights, Wildbores, Hanging Vines, Royal Guards, Pikos, Snaptooth Flytraps, Thunderbirds, and Peagawks.
- Attacking Elephant Cactuses, Brambles, Bramble Blooms, and Jellyfishes with Pew-matic Horn won't damage the player, as it is a range weapon.

## Trivia

- "Pew-matic" is a pun of the word pneumatic, which would be in reference to the type of air horn the Pew-matic is based on, and the "Pew" noise it makes when fired. This is supported by Wickerbottom using the word "pneumatic" in reference to it.
- The Pew-matic Horn is one of three weapons that can be loaded by items, the others being Spear Gun and Blunderbuss.
- The Pew-matic Horn used to have 17, 34, or 37 damage and it could only be loaded with one item at a maximum stack size of 6 and accept items that can stack to 40. It also used to have 50, 75, or 100 damage.
- The Pew-matic Horn is [featured](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pew-matic_Horn) as a Ranged weapon in Terraria as a part of the "An Eye For An Eye" crossover event.

- 200 Lava Fissures (close range)
- 75 Slam (long range)
- 150 Lava Fissures (long range)

## Exclusive to Don't Starve Together

## Event: The Forge

## Quotes
- Wilson: You sure are big!
- Willow: He looks pretty haggard.
- Wolfgang: Large pig man cannot out-muscle Wolfgang!
- Wendy: Your death will be swift.
- WX78: YOU ARE STRONG, BUT STILL ORGANIC
- Wickerbottom: We best not underestimate that one.
- Woodie: Tough guy, eh?
- Maxwell: Well he's certainly no slouch.
- Wigfrid: Yöu shall be a wörthy öppönent!
- Webber: You don't look so tough!
- Winona: Let's cut him down to size!

## Behavior
The Grand Forge Boarrior will spawn in the 10th wave of the Forge after the 3rd Boarilla has sustained the appropriate amount of damage. Battlemaster Pugna will call out for the Boarrior, who will then spawn. He has four phases (Verify), progressing to the next after a certain amount of damage has been taken. Each phase adds a new attack to his arsenal.

## Tips
- The tossing from the Grand Forge Boarrior's vicious attacks can be countered by the Steadfast Stone Armor's and Steadfast Grand Armor's knockback resistance, but this is only viable for tank characters like Woodie, Wolfgang, and Winona.
- Use the very brief grace period of the start of Grand Forge Boarrior's final phase to immediately plan out destroying the incoming Pit Pigs and Battle Standards that will come.
- The range attack at the first part of its cycle is unkitable, but the following lava fissures can be sidestepped if enough distance is kept away from Grand Forge Boarrior's attack.

## Trivia
- The Grand Forge Boarrior's spawn code is "boarrior". However, it's impossible to spawn him in the regular game, while the Console is not available at all on The Forge servers.
- Unlike most mobs, his body doesn't disappear after a few seconds once he runs out of health. This implies that he's not truly dead, just knocked out or defeated. This trait was shared with the Rhinocebros at one point, until the Infernal Swineclops followed and kept this trait.
- "Boarrior" is a portmanteau of "boar" and "warrior".
- The Grand Forge Boarrior's hooks make a "tearing fabric-like" sound effect. He also roars after finishing his range attack.

# Sea Sack

## Exclusivity: Shipwrecked

### Item Infobox
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "seasack"
- **Ingredient 1**: Seaweed (Multiplier: 5)
- **Ingredient 2**: Vine (Multiplier: 2)
- **Ingredient 3**: Shark Gills (Multiplier: 1)
- **Tab**: Survival
- **Tier**: 2
- **Perk**: +8 Inventory slots. Slows stored food spoilage.

### Description
The Sea Sack is a backpack introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC, used to expand the character's inventory. It reduces the rate of spoilage of perishable items contained within by 50% (making such items last twice as long). It requires 5 Seaweeds, 2 Vines, and 1 Shark Gills to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The Sea Sack functions identically to the Insulated Pack from the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC except that it can float on the ocean.

As with all backpacks, the Sea Sack cannot be placed in inventory or Chests but can be dropped on the ground and used for storage. Like the Piggyback and Krampus Sack, it is not flammable. Holding an item over a Sea Sack that is on the ground will give the 'Store' option, allowing the Sack to be filled without equipping it.

Despite slowing the spoilage of Food items by the same degree, the Sea Sack does not work exactly like an Ice Box. It will not stop the spoilage of Ice and Ice Cubes and will not cool a Thermal Stone.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "I hate when food has that not-so-fresh taste."
- Willow: "I have to wear this soggy thing on my back?"
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang can carry even more things!"
- Wendy: "It slows the rot and decay."
- WX78: "LOCKS IN FRESHNESS"
- Wickerbottom: "Keeps my books and provisions cool!"
- Woodie: "It's for holding my treasures."
- Maxwell: "It won't make me stronger, but it'll give me more pockets."
- Wagstaff: "A sack that protects perishables, but it is made from perishables itself."
- Wigfrid: "Disgusting, but useful in its way."
- Webber: "Eww, it's wet and squishy."
- Walani: "Squishy."
- Warly: "Wetter is better."
- Woodlegs: "Me travels moist'ly hereout."
- Wilba: "TIS A BURDEN SACK"
- Wormwood: "Keeps belly stuff fresh"
- Wheeler: "Refrigerated pocket space!"
- Choose: Wigfrid

## Tips
- The Sea Sack could be used as a temporary storage for food in case of the players Ice Boxes malfunctioning due to flooding during the Monsoon Season.
- Alternatively, it can be used as a "sea Ice Box" if the player intends to fish with Trawl Nets multiple times in a row, and the fishing spot is far away from their base.

## Trivia
- Sea Sacks were introduced in the Release the Quacken update.

**Cobblestones** are a craftable **Turf** **Item** found in the **Structures Tab**. They require 1 **Rocky Turf** and 1 **Board** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as **Fire#Fuel|fuel**.

Cobblestones allow players to lay down their own **Roads**. Similar to natural Roads, they will **Player Speed|speed up** the player by 30%. Unlike natural Roads, Cobblestones can be moved using the **Pitchfork**. Small patches of it can be found in **Mosaic** biomes.

Plants like **Berry Bush|Berry Bushes**, **Grass Tuft|Grass Tufts**, **Saplings**, **Spiky Bush|Spiky Bushes**, **Pine Cone|Pine Cones**, and **Birchnut|Birchnuts** can't be planted on these Turfs, unless they were planted before the Turfs were placed. It will also stop the **Lureplants' Lureplant#Eyeplant|Eyeplants** from spawning.

When placed on the **Surface World** covering a large enough area, **Crow**s are the only **Birds** that will spawn and land on these turfs.

## Downloadable Content
In **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, the crafting recipe for Cobblestone requires **Magma Turf** instead of **Rocky Turf**. During **Monsoon Season**, this Turf will not spawn **Puddles**. Expanding Puddles can still flood this Turf, however.

When placed on the Surface World covering a large enough area, **Toucan**s are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs. During **Hurricane Season**, there are no birds that spawn and land on these turfs.

## Trivia
* Before the introduction of **Stone Road Turf** in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, Cobblestones were the only craftable Turf that provides a faster movement speed.
* Before Cobblestones were implemented, players were able to dig up **Road Turf**.
* Brick Flooring was added as part of the **Cult of the Lamb Crossover**.

## Battle Techniques

### Kiting

Kiting is a process wherein a monster's attack is dodged, and then the monster is hit immediately after, but before the monster can attack again. The Queen attacks relatively quickly, but she is slow, so it is possible to attack her in the pauses between attacks. Always kill the recently birthed Spiders/Spider Warriors, though, before attempting to attack the Queen again. As always, good armor and weapons help a lot. If fighting without armor, having a couple of traps set around to kill the spawned spiders is a good idea. However, the Spider Queen can drain one's sanity (unless they are [[Webber]] or [[Walter]]) completely within thirty seconds (200 sanity), so it is advisable to keep the distance somewhat. Sanity-restoring items such as [[Taffy]] and [[Mushrooms|Cooked Green Caps]] can be brought to counter the sanity drain.

### Pigs

Lure the Queen to a [[Pig Village]], and let the [[Pig]]s attack her. Due to the kiting combat behavior of Pigs, the Queen and her spawned Spiders have trouble hitting them. As long as the Spiders she hatches are kept away from the Pigs, they should kill her quite quickly. This method also can prevent serious sanity drain.

### Tentacles

If there happens to be a [[swamp]] nearby, lead the Queen to the swamp and over the [[Tentacle]]s as they attack most mobs that pass by. Expect about 3-5 destroyed Tentacles in the process

# Ice Cube

![Ice Cube Dropped](Ice Cube Dropped.png) ![Ice Cube](Ice Cube.png)

The Ice Cube is a craftable Dress Item found in the Clothing Filter and Summer Items Filter. It requires 2 Electrical Doodads, 4 Rope, and 10 Ice to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

## Properties

- **Health**: -6-10/min (only with WX-78)
- **Tier**: 2
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spoil**: 8 days
- **Overheating Resistance**: 240
- **Perk**: Prevents overheating in Summer or Dry Season. Increases wetness over time. Walking speed reduced by 10%.

## Quotes

- Wilson: Stay cool, boy.
- Willow: It's a real damper on my mood.
- Wolfgang: Why put big ice on head?
- Wendy: Keep a cool head.
- WX-78: HAT SEEMS DANGEROUS TO MY FUNCTION
- Wickerbottom: A perfect cube of ice.
- Woodie: I could chop it if I had to.
- Maxwell: Strap some ice to your head.
- Wagstaff: Freezes the brain and lowers my internal body temperature.
- Wigfrid: A chunk of cold.
- Webber: This should keep us cool.
- Walani: Keeps my head cold. And wet.
- Warly: Must I wear it?
- Woodlegs: Keeps me 'ead cool.
- Wilba: WILBA HATH COLD BRAINS
- Wormwood: Cool hat!
- Wheeler: Quite frankly, I don't care who sees me like this.
- Winona: There must be a more practical solution.
- Wortox: Horns on ice!
- Wurt: This a very good hat.
- Walter: There's got to be a better way to stay cool...
- Wanda: Simple and effective.

## Tips

- Placing an Ice Cube in the Ice Box will completely stop it from melting.
- The Ice Cube is good addition to the Thermal Stone near the Endothermic Fire Pit and/or in the Ice Box for long trips during Summer.
- The Ice Cube will make inventory and equipped items Wet, causing Sanity loss. This can be used to become insane for farming Nightmare Fuel.
- Even with maximum wetness, Maxwell will not lose any sanity, making this hat rather valuable for him during summer. That being said, the faster food spoilage and slippery weapons are still large downsides to using the Ice Cube for extended periods of time.
- Dress Items with Wetness resistance, such as the Rain Coat, do not reduce wetness from the Ice Cube.
- While wearing the Ice Cube, being near a fire will slowly get rid of player wetness and will prevent the player and the player's items from becoming wet.
- It costs less Ice overall to just build a new Ice Cube than refueling an existing one with Ice, since the latter gives 0.8 days of durability per Ice instead of 0.4.
- Storing important items in the Piggyback will prevent them from becoming wet.
- Wurt does not lose sanity from the Ice Cube's Wetness.

Tentacles are hostile [[Monsters]] that specifically spawn in [[Marsh]]es or [[Caves]], though they will not spawn on [[world]]-generated [[roads]]. [[Wickerbottom]] can summon Tentacles using ''On Tentacles'', one of her self-published [[books]].

When the player or mob approaches an area containing a Tentacle, bubbles will appear on the ground. Getting closer will cause the Tentacle to bulge out of the ground before extending fully. It will then try thrashing at anything within range, and will disappear back into the ground once there's no targets left.

Tentacles take three blasts from the [[Ice Staff]] to be frozen and cannot be put to [[sleep]] or set on [[fire]]. When killed, they will drop 2 [[Monster Meat]] and can drop a [[Tentacle Spike]] or [[Tentacle Spots]].

## Behavior
Tentacles are very dangerous because of their high damage and high [[health]]. They can only be seen once a creature or player gets relatively close, meaning that a careless player can easily walk into an area with many Tentacles without noticing them before being stun-locked and killed.

At first, there will be a barely noticeable bubbling patch on the ground, followed by a piece of tentacle that looks like a purple bubble, which appears just before the Tentacle surfaces. When a creature is in range, the Tentacle will emerge and twirl around once before snapping and standing straight up. There is a brief delay before it strikes again, they will often hit an entity twice during their attack animation.

As long as its current target is still in range, a Tentacle will not change targets even if something else attacks it, similar to [[Tallbird]]s.

If its target moves out of range, the Tentacle will sink back down into the ground; it cannot move around or give chase. After going back underground, Tentacles will stay hidden until another target moves into range or directly hits them, at which point they begin to attack again.

Due to Tentacles' aggressive nature, it is common to find drops from creatures they kill or from dead Tentacles killed by other creatures (usually Merms), lying on the Swamps. One Tentacle can sometimes kill a group of 4 [[Spider]]s on their own, though it depends on the situation. Due to this behavior, many players like to use Tentacles as a food and item supplier, especially when camping in or near a

## Limpets
Limpets are a Fish Food Item in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. They can be found growing naturally on Limpet Rocks and replenish over 3 days if not mined. They can also be found on Wrecks and replenish over 2 days if not hammered. They can be used in several Crock Pot recipes and give 0.5 Fish Value.

## Cooked Limpets
Cooked Limpets are obtained by cooking Limpets on a Campfire, Fire Pit, Star, Chiminea, or Obsidian Fire Pit. They do not deduct Sanity, unlike their raw counterpart, restore a tiny bit of Health, and take longer to spoil. They can also be used in several Crock Pot recipes, giving 0.5 Fish Value.

### Trivia
- Limpets are aquatic snails with a shell that is conically shaped. True limpets (in the Patellidae family) live on hard surfaces in the intertidal zone and are capable of locomotion, unlike barnacles or mussels. Such as in Don't Starve, limpets are eaten as seafood in many countries.
- Limpets make a small "splat" sound when picked.

# Gramophone

The **Gramophone** is a craftable **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced within the **From Beyond** updates and based on the Gramophone from **Don't Starve**. It can be crafted in the **Decorations Filter** with 3 **Gold Nugget**, 2 **Electrical Doodad**, and 1 **Gears** and requires an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.

## Description

Sit back, relax, and listen to the soundtrack of your nightmares.

## Crafting Requirements

- **Gold Nugget**: 3
- **Electrical Doodad**: 2
- **Gears**: 1

## Placement and Functionality

The Gramophone can be placed on a **Wooden Table** or on the floor. It will play a music track for 62 seconds if a **Record** is inserted. The music is heard within a range of 8 tiles, becoming much quieter the further the Gramophone is away and can also be turned on and off at the Gramophone. The played record will remain in the Gramophone unless it gets replaced by another record or gets destroyed. The Gramophone can also be used to tend **Farm Plants** within a range of 2 tiles.

## Durability

Even though the Gramophone is an item, it can be destroyed with a **Hammer**. The music the Gramophone is playing doesn't replace other in-game music, so 2 different music tracks can be heard at the same time.

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: "Oh no, I've seen THAT before."
- **Willow**: "Oh, Maxwell will love this."
- **Wolfgang**: "Is box that sings!"
- **Wendy**: "Shall we have a danse macabre?"
- **WX-78**: "IT'S AN OLDER MODEL"
- **Wickerbottom**: "The music was better back in my day."
- **Woodie**: "Look at this phonograph."
- **Maxwell**: "That accursed thing!"
- **Wigfrid**: "A mechanical songstress."
- **Webber**: "We could listen to that forever."
- **Warly**: "One song can evoke many memories. Perhaps too many."
- **Wormwood**: "Singing box"
- **Winona**: "Nothin' like some music to get through the workday faster."
- **Wortox**: "Ooo, music! I'm practically giddy!"
- **Wurt**: "Music come out of it, florp!"
- **Walter**: "It's almost as good as a radio. Almost."
- **Wanda**: "Shall we play something new or something old?"

* **Woven - Elegant Moonlight Diadem**: A gleaming headdress for an enlightened mind. ![Moonlight Diadem](Moonlight Diadem Icon.png)

## Tips
* Wigfrid is allowed to give other players the Battle Helm and Battle Spear, making her a great asset to the team. However, she is the only one allowed to craft it.

## Trivia
* Willow's quote, "It's got a name scratched on the inside... "W", uh..." is a reference to the fact that every character 's name starts with a W, even including Maxwell, which is in fact his stage name from better days; his real name is William Carter.
* Initially, Moonlight Diadem skin featured a star instead of Alter's symbol. It was changed presumably due to associations with the Star of David.

# Pig Traders

Pig Traders are **Mobs** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. Various Pig Traders (besides the **Mayor Truffleston** and **Pig Queen**) can be found wandering the **Pig City** during the **Day** and will retreat to their homes as soon as it is **Dusk**. Compared to normal **Pigs**, Pig Traders are taller, completely passive, elaborately dressed, have noticeable genders depending on their professions and will not turn into **Werepigs** during a full moon. Trading **Items** with these Mobs is the player's primary source of **Oinc**s.

## Souvenir Gifting
In the Palace City, the player can find several souvenirs inside the leftmost room of the **Palace**. If the player gives any of the souvenirs (either **Post Card of the Royal Palace** or the **Queen Malfalfa** statue) to any Pig Traders outside of Palace City such as those in **Swinesbury City** (the city with the City Hall building) or those from player-created Town Houses, they will reward the player with one of the following items:

- **Kabobs**
- **Pumpkin Cookie**
- **Taffy**
- **Oinc**
- **Butter Muffin**
- **Powdercake**

Each Pig Trader can only be gifted once. Afterwards, they will reject all souvenirs.

## Economy
Each Pig Trader has specific items they desire and will reward Oincs for such items. Attempting to trade an undesired item will result in rejection. Additionally, if the player is **Wilba**, Traders in the streets will occasionally gift basic resources such as **Twigs**.

# Telelocator Staff

## Overview
The **Telelocator Staff** is a craftable [Item] found in the [Magic Filter]. It requires a [Shadow Manipulator] to prototype, and costs 2 [Living Logs], 4 [Nightmare Fuel], and 2 [Purple Gems] to craft. The Telelocator Staff has 5 uses. Each use costs 50 [Sanity].

### Quotes
- **Wilson**: "It can show me the world."
- **Willow**: "It's quite a rush to use."
- **Wolfgang**: "It gives me a headache."
- **Wendy**: "I could escape if it were more powerful."
- **WX-78**: "I WILL CALL IT THE MINION_MOVER_3000."
- **Wickerbottom**: "The gem appears to focus the nightmare fuel."
- **Woodie**: "I wonder what this thing does."
- **Maxwell**: "Magic can do amazing things, when funneled through the right channels."
- **Wagstaff**: "So it is possible to bend three dimensional space. I knew it!"
- **Wigfrid**: "I ride thröugh the air and the sea!"
- **Webber**: "It makes my brain feel fuzzy."
- **Walani**: "It shows me things I never knew I could see."
- **Warly**: "Let us take a trip. I am not picky as to where."
- **Woodlegs**: "I prefer a fast ship and th'wind at me back."
- **Wilba**: "IT GIVETH WILBA ZOOM LEGS"
- **Wormwood**: "Poof Stick"
- **Wheeler**: "I like the teleporting. Could do without being struck by lightning, though."
- **Winona**: "So you're telling me this stick is 'magic'?"
- **Wortox**: "Hassle-free hopping."
- **Wurt**: "Make head feel funny, florp..."
- **Walter**: "But getting there is half the fun!"
- **Wanda**: "It's a bit clunky, but it'll do for now."
- **Choose**: "wx78"

## Usage
The Telelocator Staff is used to teleport the player or [Mob] (including Bosses) to a random location on the map. When used on a mob, [Lightning] will strike the mob where it was standing before being teleported (possibly setting it on fire). When used on the player, lightning will strike them at the location used and also at the location they are teleported to (potentially causing fires both times). Each use will increase the world's moisture, that when high enough can start [Rain].

## Telelocator Focus
If the player built a [Telelocator Focus] in the world and stocked it with three Purple Gems, the Telelocator Staff will teleport its target to the point at which the focus is placed instead of to a random location. This consumes the gems.

## Strategy
The Telelocator Staff can be used to provide a quick escape for the player, to teleport enemies away from the player (including bosses like [Deerclops]), to commence [Rain] at will (particularly useful during Summer), or to activate WX-78's [SYSTEM OVERLOAD] perk on demand. When self-teleporting, this may leave the player lost, as the destination will be random unless a Telelocator Focus has been placed and charged, so using the staff this way may be risky. If the player teleports to a densely flammable area, the effects of the lightning can cause large amounts of damage.

## Skins
* The **[Loyal Sorcerer's Staff]** skin was awarded for watching 6 hours of **Don't Starve Together** on Twitch from August 20, 2020 to September 24, 2020. It is also available in the Klei Rewards shop for 1,200 Klei points.
* The **[Woven - Elegant Shadowbeam]** skin was introduced in the **[An Eye for An Eye]** update in 2021, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's **Terraria**. Its rarity was **[Inspired - Elegant]** initially, but received change on August 19, 2022.

## Trivia
* The word "Telelocator" defines something which is able to locate at a distance.
* When using the staff, any followers the player had at the moment (including [Chester]) will teleport off-screen near the player's teleported location.
* The Telelocator Staff used to be a [Gemology] Tab item.

## Downloadable Content

- In the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, Garlands can be obtained from the **Slot Machine**.
- In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, Garlands can be bought for 2 **Oinc**s at **Miss Sow's Floral Arrangements** in **Pig City**.

## Tips

- In all **DLC**s and **Don't Starve Together**, wearing a **Wetness** wet Garland is actually more damaging to Sanity than it is helpful. In the base game this is not an issue since items do not get wet.
- Too many players making Garland can be disruptive to hives making honey, obtaining Butterflies for more flowers or Butterfly Wings for Butter Muffins. Using a Garland for as much as is needed and then sharing it is a more effective strategy until silk is able to be obtained regularly.

## Trivia

- The Garland was added in the **Insanity!** update.
- The Garland was a fan suggestion.
- Garlands used to be edible in the older versions of **Don't Starve**.

## Hunting Strategy
When fighting Big Tentacles, bringing a Fugu Hutch can provide a great advantage. The Hutch protects the player with its spiky exterior and can kill Baby Tentacles within their first strike, leaving an open area near void of the Baby Tentacles' attacks. The regenerative powers of Hutch negate any damage from the Baby Tentacles.

If one cannot find a Hutch, one can use the Tail o' Three Cats or Bull Kelp Whip to kill the Baby Tentacles while staying safe from the range of the attacks. With the Baby Tentacles out of the way, the player can strike the big tentacle once more.

Tentacles are always considered as Wet mobs, even when it isn't raining. This makes the Electric Dart always deal 150 damage. A Wolfgang with full Mightiness can deal 300

# Armor

**Armor** is any in-game **Item** that mitigates damage and protects the character from harm. It works by absorbing a portion of incoming damage in place of the wearer's (character or mob) **Health**. Note that an armor's **Durability** is decreased every time it blocks damage.

## Calculations

When the character or mob is wearing **both** chest armor and head armor, the total received damage would be distributed as follows:

1. Initial damage is absorbed by the **primary armor**.
2. Leftover damage is absorbed by the **secondary armor**.
3. Unabsorbed damage is then subtracted from the character's or mob's **Health**.

It is difficult to tell without getting hit first or using a mod which item is designated as primary or secondary armor. Re-equipping them or reloading the game **can** change this order. The damage subtracted from the character's **Health** is the same despite the order.

**Example**: Attack damage of a **Spider Queen** (80) to a character or mob equipped with a **Grass Suit** (primary armor) and a **Football Helmet** (secondary armor) will be distributed as follows:

- 80 × 60% = 48 damage is absorbed by the **Grass Suit**
- (80 - 48) × 80% = 25.6 damage is absorbed by the **Football Helmet**
- 80 - 48 - 25.6 = 6.4 damage is subtracted from the character or mob's **Health**

Calculation can be simplified to: 80 × (1 - 60%) × (1 - 80%) = 6.4

In a generic form:

```plaintext
damage * (1 - primary armor) * (1 - secondary armor) = damage taken
```

Note that the damage taken does not change when the primary and secondary values are switched, only how durability is lost is affected.

## Chest Armor
