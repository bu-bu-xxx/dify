### Description
The **Tea Tree** is a tree type exclusive to **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, found in the Cultivated Biome outside of the Hamlets. A fully grown Tea Tree yields 1 Twigs, 2 Seed Pods, and 2 Logs when chopped.

A Tea Tree may be infested, and will spawn a Piko or Orange Piko during the day or when chopped, as well as housing the Piko during evenings and nights. Pikos will continue to spawn from and return to the stump of a chopped Tea Tree. Once the stump is dug up, the spawner is destroyed. Piko-infested Tea Trees are created during world generation. Trees planted by the player will not spawn Pikos but can be infested with homeless Pikos.

Because any housed Piko will drop from the tree when it is chopped down, one of the drops will often be stolen immediately when chopping an infested Tea Tree. Pikos will bring stolen loot back to their respective trees. Stolen items may be recovered by chopping down the tree it was stored in.

Like other trees, Tea Trees have a chance to be Peculiar, making them investigable with a Magnifying Glass or Wagstaff's Spectoggles. Chopping down Tea Trees near Birchnut Trees can cause the Birchnut Trees to turn into Poison Birchnut Trees.

### Trivia
- According to Wickerbottom, the Tea Tree's species is Camellia Sinensis.

### Tips
- Tea Tree can be infested with Piko without destroying its previous spawner: If a Piko is captured and wrapped into a Bundling Wrap and opened, the Piko will become homeless thus will find and infest a nearby Tea Tree. However, the Piko might steal the Wax Paper immediately upon opening the Bundling Wrap before running and infesting a Tea Tree.
- Tea Trees, although easier to obtain their seeds from than Rainforest Trees, drop less logs than other trees, therefore, it is best to instead buy and plant Pine Cones from Ms. Sow’s Floral Arrangements and instead chop down Tea Trees for their seed pods, only chopping down Tea Trees in the early game whilst preparations are being made.

### Bugs
- When chopping Evergreen Trees next to Tea Trees a Tea Tree might turn into a Tree Guardian looking exactly like an Evergreen Tree. The same happens when chopping down Tea Trees next to Birchnut Trees.

# Hedges

Hedges are shaped bushes found in the Pig Villages in the *Don't Starve: Hamlet* DLC. They have two forms, cut and grown. While cut, the Hedges cannot be interacted with, but when grown they can be cut either by using a Razor which will result in 1 Clippings or by using Shears which will result in 2 Clippings. Hedges will have a 3% chance to grow every 0.5-1.5 days.

Hedges are not affected by Wickerbottom's Applied Horticulture.

Upon obtaining the Key to the City, the player is also able to craft all variations of Hedges in the City Planning Tab. Using nine Clippings and some Nitre returns three items each which can then be placed similar to Walls. Manual Hedges do not differ in any way from naturally spawning Hedges. Cone Hedge and Layered Hedge can also be used as Fuel for Fire, providing the same burning time as Cut Grass.

# Trivia

- The ability to craft Hedges in the City Planning Tab was introduced in an unnamed update after the official release of the Hamlet DLC.

# Ocuvigil

## Exclusivity
Don't Starve Together

## Structure Info
- **Tool**: Can be Hammered ![Hammer](Hammer.png)
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Icon**: ![Ocuvigil](Ocuvigil.png)
- **Image**: ![Ocuvigil Build](Ocuvigil%20Build.png)
- **Description**: The cartographer's most valuable weapon.
- **Ingredients**:
  - **1 Purple Moonlens**: Multiplier 1
  - **1 Compass**: Multiplier 1
  - **2 Boards**: Multiplier 2
- **Filter**: ![Tools Filter](Tools%20Filter.png) ![Magic Filter](Magic%20Filter.png)

## Quotes
- Wilson: That's an entirely scientific mapping tool.
- Willow: Pfft. It'll burn like the rest.
- Wolfgang: Wolfgang thinks is full of secrets.
- Wendy: Grant us the power of sight...
- WX-78: LOOKS DUMB
- Wickerbottom: Ah! A scrying orb.
- Woodie: That's an odd looking tree.
- Maxwell: This is a conduit for strong revelatory magicks.
- Wigfrid: May the secrets öf this land be divulged by the göds.
- Webber: Woah! I bet it sees so far!
- Winona: Someone's got their eye on me.
- Warly: It's watching over us.
- Wortox: Hyuyu! What a mischievous way to spy!
- Wormwood: Sparkly Stone see far!
- Wurt: How it float like that?
- Wanda: Good, this will help me get the lay of the land quicker.

## Tips
- Placing Ocuvigil next to Bee Queen's hive will keep the players informed whenever she respawns. There are multiple similar uses of this structure such as keeping an eye on the spider dens, the ruins awaiting to respawn.

## Trivia
- The Ocuvigil was added in the "East or West, Base is Best" update.
- It's referred to as a "sentryward" in the game files. Also, a similar structure with the same name and function exists in multiple MOBAs.
- The name "Ocuvigil" is a portmanteau of "oculus" and "vigil".
- It used to be crafted with a Yellow Moonlens, that was replaced by a Purple Moonlens in a later update, as Yellow Gems are not easily available in worlds without Caves.
- Placing Ocuvigil on a boat that's been moved with an oar used to result in a slow and random, but automatic exploration of the ocean. Creating such set would've cost 6 planks, compass and a purple moonrock. As of the Waterlogged Update, this can no longer happen, since boats now no longer retain their momentum after rowing only once.

- Rather than throwing in **Tenpiece Oincs**, it's much more efficient to throw in **Gold** if not in emergency, since Gold can be purchased with Tenpiece Oincs at **Swinesbury Mineral Exchange**.
- Players can turn basic items into Purple Gems at the End's Well by giving them to the well, killing the Shadow Creatures that spawn, and then giving the Nightmare Fuel received back

- Walter: Ready for a journey into the unknown Woby?
- Wanda: A bit redundant, but it'll work in a pinch.

## Description
The Lazy Deserter is a **Structure** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It is found in the **Magic Filter** and **Structures Filter**, and requires a **Desert Stone**, an **Orange Moonlens**, and three **Cut Stone** to craft. Its rare **Blueprint** can be obtained by giving a **Beach Toy** Trinket to the **Antlion**, by killing the Antlion, or as a random drop from a **Loot Stash**, after killing **Klaus**. The Lazy Deserter's main use is to teleport one player to another when both are connected by using two of them.

## Teleportation Process
To teleport, one player must first activate the Deserter from the destination side. This will initially take 15 **Sanity**, then lock the player in place and generate a constant drain of 40 **Sanity**/min. The second person, right after, must either activate the Deserter on the other side, or right-click on a **Desert Stone** in their inventory. This will make this player teleport to the first player that started channeling.

When channeling a Lazy Deserter, any nearby **Desert Stones** will levitate and have their "Spikes" jut out.

Teleporting will take 50 **Sanity**, just like using the **Telelocator Staff**. If the **Desert Stone** was used, it will get consumed in the process.

## Tips
Aside from teleporting, the Lazy Deserter can be used to rapidly lower the player's sanity at no cost. This makes it very useful for farming Nightmare Creatures for their valuable **Nightmare Fuel**.

It is especially useful for **Maxwell** as with his constant sanity regeneration combined with his large nightmare fuel consumption, he does not generally go insane naturally. The Lazy Deserter gives him a no-cost way to reduce his sanity, and while worm holes accomplish the same thing, worm holes take longer to use and cannot be moved.

In a similar manner, the above method can be used on **Lunar Island** to keep the player's **Enlightenment** low.

The Lazy Deserter works well when combined with **Wanda**'s **Backtrek Watch**. A Wanda player can teleport to one of their waypoints then use a Lazy Deserter to teleport other players to the same location. This allows multi-person teleportation to various locations without using up any **Purple Gems**.

## Trivia
- The Lazy Deserter was introduced in the **Against the Grain** update.
- The teleporting effect is called "townportalsandcoffin_fx" in the game's code.

# Polar Bearger Bin

![Closed](Polar Bearger Bin Dropped.png) ![Opened](Polar Bearger Bin Opened Dropped.png)

The Polar Bearger Bin is a craftable item in **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**. It can only be crafted while next to the **Brightsmithy**. It requires the following ingredients to craft:
- 1 Spark Ark
- 1 Thick Fur
- 3 Pure Brilliance
- 5 Moon Rock

## Description
A portable fridge. Cool.

## Stacking
Does not stack

## Filter
{{Pic32|Brightsmithy Filter}}

## Tier
30

## Spawn Code
"beargerfur_sack"

## Perk
6 storage slots for **Crock Pot** Foods. Contents receive 5% spoilage rate.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "There’s still fur on it. Chilling."
- Willow: "Can't believe we made a cooler out of you."
- Wolfgang: "Keep food cold and Wolfgang fed."
- Wendy: "I already carry the coldness within."
- WX78: "FLESHLINGS CAN BE USEFUL AFTER ALL"
- Wickerbottom: "A portable chilling unit. Well and good, but cold food makes my teeth ache."
- Woody: "Keeps things nice and frosty, eh?"
- Maxwell: "Portable indeed. Wilson can carry it."
- Wigfrid: "It will preserve the freshness of my kills."
- Webber: "We like our snacks cold."
- Winona: "Weirdest lunch bucket I've ever seen."
- Warly: "This will keep my ingredients fresh."
- Wortox: "Is that where the mortals pack food away for the winter?"
- Wormwood: "Carry belly stuff. Thanks Fuzzy!"
- Wurt: "Blegh. Better not get teddy hair in food!"
- Walter: "We can keep our snacks cold when we go exploring, Woby!"
- Wanda: "It can keep my perishables cold anywhere, anytime."
- Choose: Maxwell

## Scrapbook Info
A carriable container with 6 slots that can hold prepared food. The food stored in it will be preserved for a long time.

## Game Mechanics
The Polar Bearger Bin is a storage unit that can be carried in the inventory, much like the Tackle Box. It can be opened from the inventory. While on the ground, it can be opened or closed, and can be picked up. If you start moving with an open container in your inventory, it will instantly close.

The Polar Bearger Bin can contain and preserve up to 6 stacks of Food Items that were made in a Crock Pot or Portable Crock Pot, including those that are not perishable, such as Jellybeans. It cannot store any other food or items. The spoilage rate of dishes inside the Polar Bearger Bin is multiplied by 0.05, meaning the total spoilage time is multiplied by 20.

As long as the Polar Bearger Bin is closed, any dishes stored inside are safe from the spoiling effect of Toadstool's Spore Clouds.

## Trivia
- The Polar Bearger Bin was introduced in the **Host of Horrors** update.
- On beta release prior to update 576123, the Polar Bearger Bin did not drop the Spark Ark when deconstructed.
- On beta release prior to update 576473, the Polar Bearger Bin reduced spoilage by ten times rather than twenty.
- On beta release prior to update 576966, the Polar Bearger Bin did not grant dishes immunity to the Spore Cloud's effect.

## Ryftstal (Big)
**Object_Infobox**
- Name: Ryftstal
- Image: Ryftstal.png
- Tool: Can be [Mined](#) with a [Pickaxe](#)
- Resources: Pure Brilliance ×2
- Spawn From: Rift_Phase_1, Rift_Phase_2, Rift_Phase_3
- Renew: Yes
- Spawn Code: lunarrift_crystal_big

Ryftstals can be mined with the [Pickaxe](#), [Opulent Pickaxe](#), [Pick/Axe](#), and [Brightshade Smasher](#). It takes 29 strikes to mine a Ryftstal with an Opulent or normal Pickaxe and 16 strikes with the Pick/Axe and Brightshade Smasher. However, when using the normal or Opulent Pickaxe, a certain effect will occur every 2-5 strikes causing the character to be pushed back. It is possible to explode the crystal with either 2 [Gunpowder](#), 2 [Brightshade Bombs](#) or 20 [Slurtle Slime](#).

## Ryftstal (Small)
**Object_Infobox**
- Name: Ryftstal
- Image: Ryftstal Small.png
- Resources: Pure Brilliance ×0-1
- Spawn Code: lunarrift_crystal_small
- Imagetext: a smaller variant of the Ryftstal
- Tool: Can be [Mined](#) with a [Pickaxe](#)

Like its big variant, small Ryftstals can be mined with the [Pickaxe](#), [Opulent Pickaxe](#), [Pick/Axe](#), and [Brightshade Smasher](#). It takes 13-14 strikes to mine a small Ryftstal with an Opulent or normal Pickaxe and 8 strikes with the Pick/Axe and Brightshade Hammer. The pushback effect is still the same as its counterpart. It is possible to explode the crystal with either 1 [Gunpowder](#), 1 [Brightshade Bomb](#) or 10 [Slurtle Slime](#).

- **Choose:** Wigfrid

A **Cactus** is a form of flora from the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC found only in the **Desert** biome. **Cactus Flesh** can be harvested from the Cactus at the cost of 6 **Health**. Wearing armor will decrease the amount of damage taken. When harvested it will drop **Cactus Flesh** during any season, but only in **Summer** will it drop its **Cactus Flower**.

Cacti cannot be dug up with a **Shovel**. The player will have to wait for them to regrow in 4 (3 during **Spring**) days to be able to harvest them again. Unlike most other plants, Cacti can grow back during winter, unaffected by the cold. Therefore, Cactus Flesh can be easily farmed and used in lieu of farmed vegetables during Winter.

## Tips
- Wearing a **Bramble Husk** in **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** will allow the player to pick the cacti with no health loss, and also no damage to the armor itself. This makes **Wormwood** an effective Cactus farmer.
- The Health lost is mostly negated by using a **Football Helmet** or **Log Suit**. With either of these equipped when picking the cactus, one takes only 2 damage and eating the cooked flesh will reduce this to 1.

## Trivia
- Although there appears to be a dug up version shown in image files, there is currently no known way to dig one up.
- The Cactus is modeled after the typical **Barrel Cactus**.
- The Oasis Cactus variant was introduced in the **Against the Grain** update.
- Since the update **The Curse of Moon Quay**, Cacti are now renewable due to regrowth.

# Weathered Objects

_Weathered Objects_ are objects introduced in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. They can exclusively be found in the **BFB's Nest** biome, either in the heart of the nest itself, or scattered around the island.

These objects are made of basic materials, so they are likely here to allow the player to build tools (especially a **Pickaxe**) to escape the BFB's island if they haven't got one. However, all of these objects are non-renewable: when they are destroyed, it will be permanent.

# Critters Filter
![Filter Icon](Critters Filter.png)

**Exclusive to Don't Starve Together.**

> "Is there anything cute in there??" - Willow

The **Critters Filter** is a **Filter** in the crafting menu of **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It allows players to adopt **Critter** Mobs using the **Rock Den**. Similar to the **Ancient Pseudoscience Filter** and the **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**, Critters cannot be prototyped and then made on the go in the future; in order to adopt or abandon a mob under this Filter, the player must always be near the Rock Den.

## Adoptable Mobs

The **Brightshade Bomb** is a ranged weapon exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**. It is crafted at the **Brightsmithy** with 4 **Pure Brilliance**, 4 **Brightshade Husks**, and 1 **Infused Moon Shard**.

## Trivia
- Grazers are immune to Brightshade Bombs.
- Regardless of if PvP is enabled or not, it cannot damage other players, but it can still damage the thrower. Because the bomb deals planar damage, this is enough to instantly kill even most armored Characters, only excluding ones with more than 200 HP or possessing significant planar protection.

## Scrapbook Info
- Attracts a school of fish when thrown into the ocean.

The Fish Food is an Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. It can be obtained from the level 8 Crabby Hermit in exchange for 1 Empty Bottle.

Players can also use 5 Empty Bottles to trade Fish Food Blueprint with the level 8 Crabby Hermit. It requires 2 Rot, 3 Barnacles, and 1 Silk to craft 1 Fish Food.

Fish food can be thrown into the Ocean to attract nearby Ocean Fishes and create new temporary schools of fish if there are not too many fish nearby. This effect lasts 20 seconds.

When thrown, similar to the Napsack, it creates a cloud.

## Trivia
- Fish Food was introduced in the Return of Them update "She Sells Sea Shells".
- Fish Food originally cost 3 empty bottles, this was reduced to 1 in the "The Curse of Moon Quay" update.
- Fish Food Blueprint was added in the "From Beyond" update "Staying Afloat".

- **Wanda**: These walls always seem to catch fire at the most inopportune moments.

## Hay Wall Description
The **Hay Wall** is the weakest of the four Walls, a craftable Item and a deployable Structure that prevents the player's and Mobs' movement. Once built, it can be repaired or upgraded to a second tier with another piece of Hay Wall or enough Cut Grass. It can be attacked and destroyed, leaving a destroyed Hay Wall. **Hammering** the wall will yield two Cut Grass from the second tier and one Cut Grass from other tiers. It has a maximum of 100 health and 50 health when first built before upgrades. The Hay Wall is highly flammable and one should exercise caution when fighting **Red Hounds** near it, or during a **Reign Of Giants** **Summer**. If burned, they will drop one **Ash**.

In the **Shipwrecked** and **Hamlet** DLC, **Strong Winds** can erode and destroy Hay Walls.

## Recipe
- **Item1**: Cut Grass (Count: 4)
- **Item2**: Twigs (Count: 2)
- **Result**: Hay Wall (Count: 4)

## Trivia
- Prior to the **[[Version History#September 10.2C 2013 - A Moderately Friendly Update|Moderately Friendly Update]]**, walls could be repaired using healing items, such as the **[[Honey Poultice]]**.

# Honey

![Generic](Generic.png){: width="32px"} Honey is a **Sweetener** **Food** item created by **Bees**. Honey may be obtained by killing a Bee or **Killer Bee**, by destroying a **Beehive** or **Killer Bee Hive**, or by harvesting a **Bee Box**. Honey provides 3 health points and 9 hunger points when consumed.

## Harvesting

![BeeKeeper Hat](BeeKeeper Hat.jpg){: width="32px"} Typically, harvesting is a slow process with low risk. The **Beekeeper Hat** is a specialty item designed to reduce damage from Bees. The best source for Honey is Bee Boxes; however, early in the game when these are not available yet, Bees and Beehives are a good alternative.

Ideally, Honey should be collected when all the Bees are working outside - in this case they will ignore the player entirely. Bee Boxes contain 4 Bees. The first leaves immediately in the morning and one leaves every 37.5 seconds after. The best time to harvest then becomes about 4 hours into the day or right before dusk. Harvesting is perfectly safe any time during **Winter**, since the Bees will not come out of their boxes.

Destroying Beehives is trickier because it is harder to find an opportune time when all the Bees are out. With 6 Bees and one leaving every 50 seconds, the last worker will exit the hive 8.3 game hours (250 seconds) into the day, but dusk usually comes before this can happen. However, one or two Bees can be safely ignored for the short time it takes to smash the hive if one uses protective gear.

Since Killer Bees do not leave their hive to collect nectar, there is no perfect time to attack a Killer Bee Hive. Getting close to a hive will cause all the Killer Bees to leave the hive and chase the player a short distance before retreating unless there is another **Mob** nearby. If there is, the Killer Bees can be led into the other creature and, after they lose interest in the player, they will aggro the mob and attack. The player can then attack the Killer Bee Hive while the bees are in combat or have died.

**Wendy** can use **Abigail** to easily destroy hives: once Abigail is summoned, click to attack a Beehive and then cancel the attack by walking away. Abigail will still be offensive and attack and destroy the Beehive. She can also keep the Bees stun-locked, easily taking them out and allowing the player to collect the loot from the hive.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, Honey can be found in **Mant Hills**. **Honey Chests** contain Honey and can convert **Nectar** into honey. **Lamp**s can be hammered and **Antcomb Homes** can be **mined** to receive Honey and **Honeycombs**. The Queen Womant drops 5 Honey when killed.

## Usage

Honey can be used in **Crock Pot** recipes that require sweeteners, such as **Taffy**, **Pumpkin Cookies** and **Ice Cream**. In addition, the following recipes specifically require Honey.

- **Honey Poultice**: 2 Honey, Papyrus (Alchemy Engine)
- **Honey Nuggets**: Honey, Meats, 2 Filler (Crock Pot, Meat value of 1.5 or less)
- **Honey Ham**: Honey, 2 Meats, Filler (Crock Pot, Meat value of more than 1.5)
- **Powdercake**: Honey, Corns, Twigs, Filler (Crock Pot)
- **Fresh Fruit Crepes**: Honey, Butter, 2 Fruit (Portable Crock Pot, Shipwrecked, Fruit value of 1.5 or more)
- **Oinc**: Honey (Pig Usher, Hamlet, result count 4)
- **Gummy Cake**: Honey, Gummy Slug, 2 Filler (Crock Pot, Hamlet)

## Trivia

- Honey will rot in-game, unlike in real life. However, in-game honey does have an insanely long spoil timer, likely in reference to the fact that real honey doesn't spoil.
- While Honey is not produced by Bees in the Hamlet DLC, **Mants** appear to do so, this is a reference to the fact that real life ants are closely related to bees.

# Bio Scanalyzer

Exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, the Bio Scanalyzer is an item used by **WX-78** to scan organisms and gain crafting recipes for **Circuits** and **Bio Data**. 

## Description
- **Image Gallery:**
  - Normal: ![Bio Scanalyzer Build](Bio Scanalyzer Build.png)
  - Scanning: ![Bio Scanalyzer Scanning Build](Bio Scanalyzer Scanning Build.png)
  - Dropped: ![Bio Scanalyzer Dropped](Bio Scanalyzer Dropped.png)

- **Scrapbook Description:** Chirps when interesting biological targets are nearby. Will chase and scan interesting biological targets while WX-78 is close. Drops Bio Data when finished.

- **Filter:** ![WX-78 Filter](WX-78 Filter.png) ![Tools Filter](Tools Filter.png)

- **Ingredients:**
  - Electrical Doodad: 1
  - Silk: 1

- **Durability:** Infinite

- **Stack:** Does not stack

- **Perk:** Allows WX-78 to scan organisms to unlock circuit blueprints.

- **Spawn Code:** "wx78_scanner_item"

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** "I wonder if it dreams about scanning sheep?"
- **Willow:** "Heh, how mad do you think WX would get if I painted a mustache on it?" 
- **Wolfgang:** "It sleeps now."
- **... and more.**

## Scan History
When a Bio Scanalyzer creates Bio Data, it stores a history of the kind of creature that was scanned, which affects the amount of Bio Data given in subsequent scans. The amount of Bio Data gradually recovers over the course of the next 8 minutes (one day in the game).

## Prototype Tips
- Scanning creatures with a history penalty does not incur more penalty than what that data would incur from a full scan, so scanning multiple times per day is never inefficient.
- Deploying a Bio-Scanalyzer during longer boss fights can produce extra Bio-Data.

## Trivia
- The Bio Scanalyzer was added as part of **WX-78's Character Refresh Update**.
- Its designation is "J1-M1", and his name is Jimmy.
- Its design resembles the PotatOS from **Portal 2** and might be a reference to it.

## Bugs
- If Multiple Bio Scanalyzers are deployed at the same time, a bug can occur where a second scan completes while a Bio Scanalyzer is returning to WX-78's position but hasn't dropped its data yet.

## Description
Ballphin Palaces are naturally spawning Structures introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They are found on the Ocean in Coral Reefs, and spawn Bottlenose Ballphins. They can also be crafted using 4 Limestone, 4 Seaweed, and 2 Dorsal Fins, are found in the Structures Tab, and require a Science Machine to prototype.

Each empty Ballphin Palace respawns a Bottlenose Ballphin every 4 days. However, a Ballphin Palace can hold an infinite amount of Ballphins; The Palace Ballphins return to at dusk is determined by the creator of the ballphin herd (the first Ballphin in the herd). Since Ballphins will group together in herds of 12 and start living in the same Palace this usually results in most of the Ballphin Palaces being empty so they start respawning. Ballphins that live in Palaces cannot reproduce normally via mating in mild as the herd is deleted when all its members enter the Palace so there only means of reproduction is through an empty Palace respawning them.

As with most craftable structures, Ballphin Palaces (including naturally occurring ones) can be Hammered to return half of the resources needed to craft it.

## Tips
Unlike with Pig Houses, the lights of a Ballphin Palace will not go off when the player gets too close. This allows them to be used as a rather cheap nighttime light source, if the player's boat has enough durability to last a night at sea.

Bottlenose Ballphins do not react to the player destroying their palace, so these can be a decent source of Limestone if the player cannot find any Coral Reefs.

## Trivia
Ballphin Palaces were added to the Shipwrecked DLC more than a year after its official completion in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#November 21st, 2017 - Home Sea Home Update|Home Sea Home** update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.

# Lunar Rift

![Wagstaff and his portal](Wagstaff and his portal.jpg)

> "Be warned, assisting the Cryptic Founder will alter your world and cannot be undone. Much will be lost and gained in the name of Progress. Are you sure you'd like to continue?" — The Price of Ambition

## Activating
![ThePriceOfAmbition](ThePriceOfAmbition.png)

After players defeat the Celestial Champion, a Grainy Transmission will appear near a Lunar Essence Extractor and ask for an Enlightened Shard. Players can show the Enlightened Shard to Grainy Transmission and then give it to him. If the players choose not to give the Shard, Grainy Transmission will randomly appear on the surface of the world, and players can give him the shard then.

Once assisting Wagstaff, the world will change irreversibly:
- The Lunar Rift will spawn periodically.
- Abandoned Junk spawns and Wagstaff hints at their location periodically.
- Scrappy Werepig will drop different loot.

## Lunar Rift
The Lunar Rift is a dangerous phenomenon that appears in the world after assisting Wagstaff. It has three stages, and its presence affects the world in various ways, such as causing Lunar Hail and mutations in certain creatures.

| Phase | Radius | Grazer | Ryftstal |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1     | 1      | 1      | 0        |
| 2     | 3      | 3      | 4        |
| 3     | 6      | 6      | 12       |

## Effects to the World
While the Lunar Rift exists, it has several additional effects on the forest world:
- Lunar Hail happens periodically.
- Certain creatures are mutated by Gestalts after their death, becoming Crystal Deerclops, Armored Bearger, and Possessed Varg.
- Bright-Eyed Frogs have a 60% chance to replace a regular Frog during Frog Rain.

## Lunar Thralls
Each time the Rift spawns, a Lunar Thrall is randomly selected to be released into the world, and each Lunar Thrall is released in a different way. A full list of Lunar Thralls includes Deadly Brightshade, which appears when the Rift reaches its final stage.

# Night Light

- **Ingredient 2**: Nightmare Fuel (multiplier: 2)
- **Ingredient 3**: Red Gem (multiplier: 1)
- **Sanity Drain**: -3/min, up to +7/min (only with **Willow**)

## Description
Light the night with your dreams.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: It gives off a spooky light.
- **Willow**: It's like fire, but purple!
- **Wolfgang**: Is strange glow.
- **Wendy**: Eerie and yet beautiful.
- **WX-78**: UNKNOWN LIGHT SOURCE
- **Wickerbottom**: Curiously luminescent.
- **Woodie**: What kind of darkness is that?
- **Maxwell**: It burns with a beautiful glow.
- **Wagstaff**: Amazing. It emits a psychic attack along with light energy!
- **Wigfrid**: I'm more comfortable around my own fire.
- **Webber**: It makes our skin crawl.
- **Walani**: Lights the night with 'mares.
- **Warly**: And I thought fluorescent tubes were a bad invention!
- **Woodlegs**: Don't provide much comfort, do it?
- **Wilba**: WILBA LIKETH SHINY THING
- **Wormwood**: Glowy
- **Wheeler**: It's like a garden light fueled by evil.
- **Choose**: woodlegs

The **Night Light** is a **Magic** **Structure** in **Don't Starve**. It requires a **Prestihatitator** to prototype and costs 8 **Gold Nuggets**, 2 **Nightmare Fuel**, and 1 **Red Gem** to craft.

The Night Light provides a refuellable light similar to a **Fire Pit**, and can only be fueled using Nightmare Fuel. One Nightmare Fuel provides light for 175 seconds, and reaches maximum output with 3 Nightmare Fuel. It does not provide warmth, so it will not prevent **Freezing**. Once placed, the Night Light cannot be moved (only destroyed/deconstructed).

Standing next to an active Night Light lowers **Sanity** by 3 per minute (except for **Willow**, who gains up to +7/min). Being near the Night Light at dusk or night increases the total Sanity drain to 8 points per minute. The Sanity drain can be avoided by standing some distance away.

The Night Light's ghastly flames can still be affected by **Night Hand**s.

## Downloadable Content
In all **DLC**s, when a Night Light begins to smolder, it will not burst into flames, but instead, lights up as if it were fueled. Also, Night Lights can be extinguished by an **Ice Flingomatic**, **Luxury Fan**, or **Ice**. Also it does not provide warmth to cause **Overheating** during **Summer** or **Dry Season**.

## Tips
Night Lights can be a useful light source in **Caves** and **Ruins**, where there is an abundance of Nightmare Fuel. It also has niche use on **Maxwell**, as it can make it easier for him to go insane due to his constant sanity regeneration, and his dependence on Nightmare Fuel makes it more likely for him to have spare amounts to fuel the Night Light. Otherwise, it has no use on the surface where Nightmare Fuel is not as plentiful and materials to fuel other fires are.

## Trivia
- The Night Light was added in the **Insanity!** update.
- The Night Light used to share its model with **Maxwell's Light** in the older versions of **Don't Starve**.
- The gem on a Night Light has five corners. However, the Red Gem used to craft it only has four.
- In older versions, the **Fire Staff** could be used as a way to fuel Night Lights. One shot fueled it for 175 seconds, the same as 1 Nightmare Fuel.

The **Brightshade Sword** is a [[Weapon]] exclusive to [[Don't Starve Together]], introduced in [[From Beyond]]. It can only be crafted while next to the [[Brightsmithy]], requiring 4 [[Pure Brilliance]] and 3 [[Brightshade Husk]]s to craft.

The Brightshade Sword deals 38 physical damage and 30 [[Planar Damage]] for a total of 68 damage. The sword also deals 10% more total damage to [[Shadow Aligned]] creatures, for a total of 74.8 damage. Planar damage pierces through the protection of worn [[Armor]] and [[Planar Entity Protection]].

If the [[Brightshade Helm]] is equipped, the Brightshade Sword deals 10% more physical damage and an additional 5 planar damage for a total of 76.8 damage (or 84.5 damage to Shadow Aligned creatures). Therefore, equipping the helm turns the Brightshade Sword into the strongest general purpose melee weapon in the game, except for [[Wanda]]'s [[Alarming Clock]] and [[Wigfrid]]'s [[Charged Elding Spear]].

[[Wormwood/Don't Starve Together|Wormwood]] with the [[Wormwood/Don't_Starve_Together#Lunar_Guardian|Lunar Guardian II]] Skill has a 20% chance to spawn a vine that deals 70 physical and 15 planar damage when attacking with the Brightshade Sword.

When the Brightshade Sword's durability reaches 0%, it does not disappear; instead, it is unequipped and can no longer be equipped until repaired. It can be fully repaired by one [[Brightshade Repair Kit]].

### Trivia
- While it appears as a sword made of light, the Brightshade Sword is not a light source like the [[Morning Star]], nor does it prevent damage from [[Darkness]] like the [[Brightshade Helm]].
- Wilson's quote for the Brightshade Sword is a reference to Lightsabers, laser melee weapons in the Star Wars franchise that make a distinct sound. People playing with prop/toy lightsabers often mimic their sound.

The **Sea Chest** is a craftable **Structure** introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is found in the **Structures Tab**, requires a **Science Machine** to prototype, and 4 **Boards** and 1 **Tar** to craft. It works similar to a regular **Chest**, but can only be placed on the **Ocean**.

Because **Krampus** cannot spawn in the sea, he cannot break or steal items from Sea Chests.

### Trivia
- The Sea Chest was added to **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** more than a year after its official completion in the **Home Sea Home** update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.
- The Sea Chest shares its appearance with the **Octopus Chest**.

- Choose: Wilson

**Carpeted Flooring** is a craftable Turf Item. It requires 1 Beefalo Wool and 1 Board to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Like other turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as fuel.

Players can find Carpeted Flooring around Chess biomes; for example, a Wooden Thing's spawn location has several among the Checkerboard Flooring. There are also some Set Pieces that spawn a few tiles of Carpeted Flooring.

Eyeplants cannot spawn on this Turf, making it an expensive and artificial way of protecting oneself from Eyeplants. Plants like Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Pine Cones, and Birchnuts can't be planted on these turfs, unless these were planted before the turfs were placed.

When placed on the Surface World and the area is large enough, Crows are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs.

Although 1 Beefalo Wool is used to craft the Carpeted Flooring and Beefalo Wool is mainly used to craft warm clothing for Winter, Carpeted Flooring does not provide the player with any warmth.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, this Turf will not spawn Puddles. Expanding Puddles can still flood this Turf, however.

## Trivia
- Carpeted Flooring was introduced in the "A Little Rain Must Fall" update.
- Before the "Hungry For Your Hunger" update, Carpeted Flooring required the Shadow Manipulator to prototype.
- In older versions of Don't Starve, Carpeted Flooring could be found in the same area as Maxwell's Door, along with Marble Pillars.

# Tall Grass

## Exclusivity
Exclusive to **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC.

## Object Infobox
- **Image**: ![Tall Grass](Tall Grass.png)
- **Tool**: 
  - Machete, Luxury Machete: yields one Cut Grass after three hits.
  - Shears: yields two Cut Grass in one cutting.
  - Shovel, Regal Shovel: yields one Cut Grass and gives a Grass Tuft to be replanted.
- **Resources**: 
  - Cut Grass ×1 (Machete, Luxury Machete)
  - Cut Grass ×2 (Shears)
  - Cut Grass ×1, Grass Tuft Dug (Shovel, Regal Shovel)
- **Spawns**: Weevole (up to three during the evening, night, and when the tuft is hacked or sheered)
- **Renew**: No
- **Biome**: Plains, Rainforest
- **Spawn Code**: "grass_tall"

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It's too tough to pick with my hands."
- Willow: "This grass is tough!"
- Wolfgang: "Very sturdy grass."
- Wendy: "Alas, I'm too weak to pick it."
- WX-78: "TOWERING GROUND PARTS"
- Wickerbottom: "I need an implement for that."
- Woodie: "Don't worry your head about this one, Lucy."
- Maxwell: "Oh, joyous occasion. I've found grass."
- Wagstaff: "The obstinacy of this grass requires something sharper than my hands."
- Wigfrid: "Surely 'tis the grass of Jötunheim!"
- Webber: "It's taller than we are!"
- Walani: "It's too much work to pick it with my hands."
- Warly: "Too long to cut it with my hands."
- Woodlegs: "As tall as the sky."
- Wilba: "AS LONG AS THE DAY IS MERRY"
- Wormwood: "You're so tall!"
- Wheeler: "Tall grass like that is going to need a machete."

## Description
'Tall Grass' is a **Plant** exclusive to **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, which can be found in the **Plains** and **Rainforest** Biomes. Just like the **grass** in the base game, it yields **Cut Grass**, but only with the help of a tool. Unlike **Grass Tuft**, Tall Grass takes 4 days to regrow (rain will reduce this time) and never withers because of high temperature. However, like Grass Tuft, Tall Grass does not grow during **Winter**.

## Growth and Infestation
- Depending on the biome/turf Tall Grass is planted in, it will grow as a different plant. If the Grass Tuft is planted on **Wild Plains Turf**, **Rainforest Turf**, **Deep Rainforest Turf**, or **Dense Turf**, it will grow as a Tall Grass, and there will be no need to fertilize it. But if it is replanted in any other biome/turf, it will grow as an ordinary one, and the player will have to use **Manure**, **Guano**, or **Rot** beforehand in order to fertilize it.
- Tall Grass tufts may be infested with **Weevole**s. Harvesting, digging up or burning an infested Tall Grass tuft will remove the infestation. Game attempts to create new infested grass each time the grass regrows as long as there is no other infested grass nearby (within 3 pitchfork tiles).

## Trivia
- Tall Grass used to be yellow, but the color was changed in the **Quality of Life** update.
- Before the update Rev. 307715, digging up the Tall Grass with a Shovel would yield no Cut Grass.

- Choose: Webber

A **Dung Pile** is a naturally spawning object introduced in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC**, which can mostly be found in **Tall Grass** biome.

## Resources
Each Dung Pile will yield up to 3 items when dug. To obtain them, the player can either use their bare hands, or a **Shovel**: 
- **Bare Hands**: It will take 3 hits for the Dung Pile to be completely dug, and the player will lose 10 **Sanity** at each hit, for a total of -30 sanity per Pile.
- **Shovel**: The 3 items will be yielded (and the Dung Pile completely dug) at once, without any Sanity loss.

**Manure** and **Rocks** are the two most common items found in a Dung Pile, and at least one of these will be found each time a pile is dug. **Bone Shards** is also a common resource. More rarely, one can find **Flint**, **Grass** or **Twigs**.

The Dung Pile can spawn a **Dung Beetle**, along with its **Dung Ball**, which makes Rocks and Flint renewable. Be careful though: even if the first spawn doesn't destroy the Dung Pile, if a Dung Beetle is deprived of its Dung Ball, it will return to the closest Dung Pile, destroying it to make a new Dung Ball out of it.

It's a flammable object, and will yield an **Ash** if set on fire.

## Tips
- While the Dung pile is renewable only via **BFB** spawning, it's better to let the Dung Pile in place and wait for a **Dung Ball** to spawn if there's any need of rocks or manure.
- If the player digs in a dung pile when playing as **Wormwood** the player will gain 10 sanity per dig for a total of 30 sanity per dung pile.

- Wolfgang: "This is bush. Of vines."
- Wendy: "They look as if they want to choke something."
- WX78: "NATURE IS CHAOS"

- Woodlegs: "Ya look like a tangled pile o'riggin'."
- Wilba: "HATH THE TWIRLY ROPES."
- Wormwood: "Ropey friend."
- Wheeler: "Ropey friend"

## Description

Viney Bushes are plants found in the Jungle biome in the Shipwrecked DLC. A Viney Bush can be harvested with a Machete to obtain a Vine. Harvested Viney Bushes regrow in 4 days. They are not affected by Winter cold. Some Viney Bushes contain Snake Dens. When these are approached, or attempted to be hacked with a Machete, Snakes will spawn and attack the offender. Additionally, the Snakes will leave the den at Dusk, roam around all night and go back to their den at dawn. Snake infested Viney Bushes will make hissing sounds and periodically shake, allowing them to be distinguished from normal Viney Bushes. Each Snake den contains up to 3 Snakes. If one or more of the Snakes are killed, a new one will spawn every 90 seconds to replace them.

Viney Bushes can be dug up with a Shovel and replanted elsewhere. Viney Bushes planted by players will not spawn snakes. Planted Viney Bushes require Fertilizers to grow. Using a Shears on a Viney Bush will result in 2 Vines instead of the usual one.

## Tips

- A Spider Den next to a Snake Den will result in nightly battles between the two. Monster Meat will be eaten if not picked up quickly, but Spider Glands, Silk and Snakeskin will be left on the ground. Wearing a Spiderhat while collecting will prevent spiders from attacking.

## Bugs

- If the bush is chopped down while the snakes are outside, the bush will look fully grown when the snakes return to it.
- If a Snake Den Viney Bush withers during Dry Season, the bush will look fully grown when the snakes spawn.

# Dreadstone Outcrop

The **Dreadstone Outcrop** is a mineable object in **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**. It appears on top of the first **Nightmare Fissure** that a player approaches while there is an active **Shadow Rift**.

## Drops
- **Dreadstone** ×3

## Tool
Can be **Mined** only by reinforced tools. 
![PickSlashAxe](PickSlashAxe)

## Spawns
- **Miasma**
- **Shriek**
- **Rasp**

![Spawns](Miasma, Shriek, Rasp, Jitters, Rictus)

## Exclusivity

## Rift Content
Shadow Rift

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: It's coming from deep down in those chasms...
- **Willow**: It's growing from way down below.
- **Wolfgang**: Scary rock comes from scary place...
- **Wendy**: Do I dare imagine what kind of darkness it grew from?
- **WX-78**: IF I COULD JUST GET TO THE SOURCE!
- **Wickerbottom**: Its source must lie even deeper underground.
- **Woodie**: I don't like where this is going, and I really don't like where it's comin' from.
- **Maxwell**: It comes from the depths below.
- **Wigfrid**: It hails from a place deeper and darker than even here.
- **Webber**: More of that scary rock...
- **Winona**: Must be a lot of the stuff growing down there.
- **Warly**: More of that curious stone.
- **Wormwood**: Growing up, up, up!
- **Wortox**: Who knows where it grows from?
- **Wurt**: Oooh, big shiny rock!
- **Walter**: I bet there's more buried deep underground!
- **Wanda**: It's coming from deep below the surface.
- **Choose**: Wendy

## Tips
- It is easiest to wait until only one Ink Blight is alive to mine the Outcrop for its Dreadstone.
- Wearing the **Brightshade Helm** prevents being slowed while in the Miasma, while wearing the **Void Cowl** prevents damage from the Miasma. Whichever trait is more useful to mine the Outcrop can depend on if the player is trying to dodge attacks while mining, or if enemies are distracted. Regardless, the Miasma does not deal too much damage in the time it takes to mine the Outcrop.
- **Winona** with **Enlightened Strike** Skill can also use Planar Strike to mine the Dreadstone Outcrop.

## Trivia
- The Dreadstone Outcrop was introduced in the **Terrors Below** update.

# Sails in Don't Starve: Shipwrecked

Sails are craftable Nautical items introduced in the Shipwrecked DLC. They provide speed and acceleration bonuses to Boats and allow players to hold items while sailing.

The Sign is a craftable [[Structure]]. It cannot be written on, but it shows up as an icon on the [[Map]]. It can be used as a marker for areas of interest which do not show up on the Map (such as [[Blue Mushroom]]s and/or Mushroom Rings, or [[Beefalo]] herds).

The Sign requires 1 set of [[Boards]] to craft and a [[Science Machine]] to prototype. If it is destroyed, the [[Boards]] are returned, allowing the player to build a new Sign elsewhere.

## Trivia
- Signs were added in the [[Version History|A Little Rain Must Fall]] update.

# Exclusivity: Don't Starve Together

## Mushroom Lights

Mushroom Lights are **Don't Starve Together** exclusive objects, introduced in **A New Reign**. There are two types of Mushroom Lights, Mushlight and Glowcap. Their respective **Blueprints** can be found by killing a **Toadstool** or from opening a **Loot Stash** after killing a **Klaus**.

Both Mushlight and Glowcap have 4 slots. In these, players can place **Light Bulbs**, **Glow Berries**, **Lesser Glow Berries**, **Mushroom Spores**, **Festive Lights**, **Crustashine**s or **Enlightened Shard**s for the lights to function. The lights also act like an **Ice Box** and slow down the spoilage of the items put inside by 75%, extending the spoilage time by four times. Light Bulbs that spoil inside a mushroom light will drop as rot on the ground nearby. If an **Enlightened Shard** is placed in the Mushroom Lights, all perishable items in the inventory will not spoil, making it a great infinite light source. Festive Lights can also be used for infinite source of light, as they will still glow even when they reach 0%.

### Mushlight

The **Mushlight** is a light source that can accept all items listed above except for **Mushroom Spores**. The light emitted by a Mushlight will always be white, regardless of the colors of **Festive Lights** and **Enlightened Shard**s placed inside.

The more items placed inside, the bigger the light radius will be. However, one **Enlightened Shard** is enough to make a Mushlight to emit max level lights.

### Glowcap

The **Glowcap** is an advanced version of the Mushlight, having a more expensive recipe. Unlike the Mushlight, the Glowcap is able to accept **Mushroom Spores**. The players can customize its color by placing Mushroom Spores, **Festive Lights** and colored **Enlightened Shard**s inside the Glowcap. **Light Bulbs**, **Glow Berries**, **Crustashine**s and empty Enlightened Shards will produce white light.

By mixing multiple colors in a Glowcap, one can obtain different color tones besides of red, green, and blue:
- Purple - 1 Red Spores, 3 Blue Spore
- Pink - 3 Light Bulbs, 1 Red Spore
- Yellow - 2 Red Spores, 2 Green Spores
- Orange - 3 Red Spores, 1 Green Spore
- White - 1 of each spore type, leaving 1 slot empty.
- Cyan - 2 Blue Spores, 2 Green Spores

The more items placed inside, the bigger the light radius will be. However, one **Enlightened Shard** is enough to make a Glowcap to emit max level lights.

## Skins

- The **Woven - Elegant Lilycap Light** skin was introduced during the official **Year of the Carrat** event in 2020.
- The **Woven - Elegant Mushlamp Post** skin was introduced during the official **Year of the Beefalo** event in 2021.
