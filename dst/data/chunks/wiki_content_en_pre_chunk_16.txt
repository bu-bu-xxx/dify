The **Tar Extractor** is a craftable **Structure** introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is found in the **Nautical Tab** and requires 2 **Coconut**s, 4 **Bamboo**, and 4 **Limestone**s to craft. Tar Extractors can only be placed on top of **Tar Slicks**. They will extract **Tar** and drop it at the output end every 2 minutes (4 per **Day**). When fully fueled, a Tar Extractor will last for two days, producing a total of 8 Tar. They can be refueled self-sufficiently by using some of the extracted Tar.

### Tips
- Tar Slicks can only be found in **Medium** and **Deep Ocean**, so the player will be exposed to **Waves** when interacting with a Tar Extractor. **Sea Walls** can be built for protection.
- Alternatively, the player can create Tar Slicks with the **Quacken Drill**, providing easier access to Tar.

### Trivia
- The Tar Extractor was added to the **Shipwrecked** DLC more than a year after its official completion in the **Home Sea Home** update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.

# Table Vase

![Table Vase](Table Vase.png)

The **Table Vase** is a craftable item exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced within the **From Beyond** updates. It can be crafted in the Decorations Filter or Carpentry Filter with 2 Logs and 1 Rope and requires a Sawhorse to prototype.

# Lumpy Evergreens

## Description
Lumpy Evergreens are a variant of the typical [Evergreen](Tree/Evergreen) with lumpy and wilted-looking branches. Unlike normal Evergreens, the Lumpy variety does not produce [Pine Cones], leading [Characters] to wonder how it reproduces at all. They still have a life-cycle, growing to huge trees and then reverting to small ones. Also like normal trees, lumpy ones can become [Treeguards], which will have the lumpy appearance as opposed to the standard treeguard look.

## Characteristics
- **Image Gallery:**
  ![Normal](A Lumpy Evergreen.png)
  ![Stump](Evergreen Stump.png)
  ![Sapling](Lumpy Evergreen Sapling.png)
- **Tool:** Can be [Chopped](Tools#Chopping_Tools) with an [Axe]({{pic|32|Axe}}). Can be [Dug](Tools#Dug_Tools) with a [Shovel]({{pic|24|Shovel}}) (when Sapling or Stump).
- **Can Be Burned:** Yes (1)
- **Resources:** [Log]({{pic24|Log}})
- **Renew:** No
- **Spawns:** [Lumpy Treeguard]({{pic24|Lumpy Treeguard}})
- **Biome:** [Forest]
- **Spawn Code:** "evergreen_sparse"

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** "This sad tree has no cones."
- **Willow:** "Die in a fire!"
- **Wolfgang:** "Cheer up, tree!"
- **Wendy:** "Its cycle of life is ending."
- **WX-78:** "PATHETIC TREE DROPS NO BABIES"
- **Wickerbottom:** "This genus seems to lack reproductive capabilities."
- **Woodie:** "Lucy would want me to chop it down."
- **Maxwell:** "It looks sickly."
- **Wagstaff:** "It must undergo some kind of spontaneous generation."
- **Wigfrid:** "A good, sturdy tree."
- **Webber:** "A dying breed."

- **Warly:** "A coneless arbre."

- **Wortox:** "A mournful tree full of lumps and bumps."
- **Wurt:** "Tree look skinny, someone should feed it."
- **Walter:** "What a scraggly tree."
- **Wanda:** "It looks sickly."

## Additional Information
When spawned naturally in [Survival](Survival Mode), Lumpy Evergreens only appear in [Forest] Biomes; however, in [Adventure Mode], they may be found elsewhere. Often entire forests of Lumpy Evergreens will be found, but they usually do not mix with standard Evergreens. The number of Lumpy Evergreens generated in a world is not affected by the "Trees" slider setting in the custom world settings.

In [Don't Starve Together], Lumpy Evergreens are renewable due to World [Regrowth], where Lumpy Saplings will periodically spawn in the world.

## Wooden Flooring Details
Wooden Flooring is a craftable Turf Item. It requires 1 Board to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. It can also be found underneath a Pig King or near Touch Stones. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as fuel. To place the wooden flooring (or any kind of flooring), you will need to use a pitchfork to plow the ground where you want to place it.

Eyeplants cannot spawn on this Turf, making it the cheapest artificial way of protecting oneself from Lureplants. Plants like Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bush, Pine Cones, and Birchnuts can't be planted on these turfs, unless these were planted before the turfs were placed.

When placed on the Surface World in a large enough area, Crows are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs.

Despite being made out of wood, Wooden Flooring is not flammable when placed, meaning the player can place Campfires and Fire Pits on it as normal.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, this Turf will not spawn Puddles. Expanding Puddles can still flood this Turf, however.

## Trivia
Wooden Flooring strongly resembles the flooring in Wilson's own home as seen in Forbidden Knowledge.

# Exclusivity: Don't Starve Together

## Archive Switch
The **Archive Switch** is a **Set Piece** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. It can be found in the **Ancient Archive** biome.

### Description
It is composed of three **Ornate Pedestals**. Initially, two of them contain an **Iridescent Gem** each and the last one is empty. Attempting to place other gems will result in a failure announcement, but placing another Iridescent Gem will activate the switch and power **Archive Chandeliers**, the **Archive Orchestrina**, **Ancient Guard Posts**, and the **Fountains of Knowledge**. Activating the switch for the first time will immediately set the **Nightmare Cycle** to the Nightmare Phase accompanied by a sound that plays in every underground biome. Additionally, **Nightmare Ramparts** will permanently spawn in the **Lunar Grotto**. The power can be cut again by removing an Iridescent Gem.

| [Broken AAC Device] | 10 Gold Nuggets |

## Tips

- Meat that is not accepted by the King can be converted into Eggs by a Bird in a Birdcage, and then offered to the King. This makes Gold Nuggets an infinite resource, as Meat is a renewable resource in the game.
- A low cost method of obtaining Gold from the Pig King would be to place Lureplants on turf, such as Rocky Turf or Wooden Flooring, or a Boat, where they can't spawn Eyeplants, and repeatedly harvest the bait.
- A quick method to amass Gold from the Pig King would be to make a few Fishing Rods and fish for Eels in the Caves, as each Eel trades for 5 Gold whether it is alive, dead or cooked.

## Trivia

- The Pig King will throw the Gold Nuggets towards the player's camera. Turning the camera will cause the Gold Nuggets to

## Description
Anti Venom is a Survival Tab item exclusive to the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It requires a Science Machine to prototype and can be crafted using 1 Venom Gland, 3 Seaweed, and 2 Coral. It is used to remove the effects of Poison.

## Usage
Each Anti Venom is single use only. Anti Venom provides no benefits when quaffed if the player is not already poisoned. One can protect themselves from poison by wearing a Seashell Suit, a Particulate Purifier, or a Horned Helmet, depending on the source of the Poison. WX-78 is immune to poison, therefore Anti Venom has no benefits to them.

## Availability
Anti Venom can also be found in X Marks the Spot treasure chests.

## Hamlet
In the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, Anti Venom cannot be crafted as some of its materials are unavailable. Instead, it can be bought for 5 Oincs at the Curly Tails Mud Spa in the Pig City.

## Trivia
- Anti Venom shares its animation with Snake Oil and Poison Balm.
- The animation is also similar to the /joy emote in Don't Starve Together.

## Bugs
Anti Venom does not provide protection against Poison, despite it intends for one to be immune to poison for 1 day in game files.

# Pig Houses

## Description

Pig Houses are natural and craftable structures where Pigs spawn and live. A Pig is spawned once a Pig House is constructed and respawns after 4 days if killed. Pig Houses are naturally occurring in Pig Villages, with the possibility of the village containing the Pig King. Occasionally, an individual Pig House can be found in the wilderness.

## Crafting

A Pig House requires:
- 4 Boards
- 3 Cut Stones
- 4 Pig Skins

An Alchemy Engine is needed to prototype.

### Structure Infobox

- Tool: Can be Hammered {{pic|32|Hammer}}
- Can Be Burned: 1
- Icon: Pig House.png
- Image: PigHouse.png
- Image Width: 150
- Biome: Grassland, Forest, Pig Village
- Spawn Code: "pighouse"
- Spawns: {{Pic|30|Pig}}
- Ingredient 1: Boards (Multiplier 1: 4)
- Ingredient 2: Cut Stone (Multiplier 2: 3)
- Ingredient 3: Pig Skin (Multiplier 3: 4)
- Tier: 2
- Tab: Structures

## Quotes

- Wilson: "These pigs have pretty fancy houses."
- Willow: "These pigs have questionable taste in architecture."
- Wolfgang: "The door is too small for me."
- Wendy: "At least they are comfortable."
- WX-78: "THE FURNITURE IS ALL PIG-SHAPED"

## Tips

1. Since resources required to build a Pig House are quite demanding, a good idea is to find and hammer down naturally generated houses found on the map and rebuild them in a preferred place. Each hammered down house gives back half of the resources required to build a new one (2 Cut Stones, 2 Boards, and 2 Pig Skins). If a Deconstruction Staff were used on them, they will give all the resources back.
2. It's not recommended to build Pig Houses too close to one's base since they eat Food items on the ground. Eating Monster Foods accidentally left on the ground could turn them into a Werepig. Likewise, if for whatever reason a Pig is outside their House during a Full Moon they'll turn into a Werepig anyway.
3. Building one or two Pig Houses next to a Spider Den can make a beneficial farm. The player can provoke the spiders to come out, which will cause the pigs to attack them. The player can watch over them kill each other and loot the items they drop. This can be an easy supply of Silk, (Monster) Meat, Pig Skin, and Spider Glands.

## Trivia

- According to WX-78, Pigs decorate the insides of their homes with pig-shaped furniture.
- Characters have different examination quotes for an occupied Pig House at dusk and night.
- Warly's quote on the Pig House is a clear reference to "The Three Little Pigs".

- Choose: Walani

## Description
Palm Trees are a variety of Tree found in Beach biomes in the Shipwrecked DLC. When chopped down with an Axe, they yield Logs and Palm Leaves. Fully-grown Palm Trees will grow Coconuts, which will also drop when the tree is cut down. The Coconuts can be planted to create Palm Tree Saplings, which grow into new Palm Trees. They can also be split into 2 halves with a Machete, allowing them to be used as food, however they can no longer be planted once split. As with almost all trees (with the exception of the Mangrove Tree), the stump may be dug up with a Shovel to yield another Log.

Palm Trees may be destroyed by Strong Winds.

Similar to its Evergreen and Lumpy Evergreen counterparts, when a Palm Tree is chopped down, there is a chance that some nearby Palm Trees may become Palm Treeguards. Palm Treeguards will not spawn before day 4 starts. Chopping down a Palm Tree has a 1/75 chance to spawn Palm Treeguards. Provided that there are enough Palm Trees around, before day 31, 3 Palm Treeguards will spawn. Starting from day 31, there is a 50% chance a 4th will also spawn. After day 80, a minimum of 4 will spawn, with 50% chance to spawn a 5th.

While Chopping down fully grown Palm Trees, there is a 1% chance for a Coconut to fall on every strike. The Coconut deals 20 damage, which can be partially mitigated by wearing Armor. The fallen Coconut stays intact and can be collected.

## Tips
* The Lazy Forager can catch falling Coconuts before it can damage the character.

## Trivia
* Strangely, Palm Trees grow huskless coconuts.
* When planting coconuts that are very close to rotting they can actually become Rot on the ground if they do not reach the first stage before their rot timer runs out.

## Bugs
* In worlds linked with Shipwrecked using Seaworthy, Palm Trees can sometimes be found in Adventure Mode.

# Dreadstone Helm

- **Icon:** Dreadstone Helm.png
- **Equip Slot:** Head
- **Image:** Dreadstone Helm Dropped.png
- **Scrapbook Description:** This helm slowly repairs itself.
- **Description:** A sturdy helmet of blackest stone.
- **Ingredient 1:** Dreadstone (Multiplier 4)
- **Ingredient 2:** Pure Horror (Multiplier 4)
- **Filter:** Armor Filter, Magic Filter
- **Durability:** 840
- **Perk:** Repairs itself over time while worn.
- **Sanity Bonus:** 
  - -20 Sanity/min at <100% Durability
  - (-10 Sanity/min w/ Dreadstone Armor)
- **Water Resistance:** 20% resistance
- **Spawn Code:** dreadstonehat
- **Protection:** 
  - 90%
  - (91% vs Shadow Aligned)
  - (92% vs Shadow Aligned w/ Dreadstone Armor, Void Robe)
- **Planar Protection:** 
  - 5 flat
  - (10% applied before flat vs Shadow Aligned)
  - (20% applied before flat vs Shadow Aligned w/ Dreadstone Armor, Void Robe)
- **Tier Text:** Blueprint (rare) (Nightmare Werepig)

The **Dreadstone Helm** is a craftable head slot Armor, crafted in either the Armor or Magic Filter. It requires 4 Dreadstone and 4 Pure Horror to craft. The Rare Blueprint for the Dreadstone Helm is dropped after defeating the Nightmare Werepig.

## Durability Restoration

The helmet restores durability every second by a certain amount, which depends on the amount of sanity of the character and is calculated by the formula: \( P = \dfrac{1}{1000 + (428.57*t)} * b \)

Where:
- \( P \) is the percentage of recovery as a decimal;
- \( t \) is the percentage of the character's sanity as a decimal fraction;
- \( b \) is the bonus from having Dreadstone Armor also equipped, which is equal to 1.5 if equipped, and 1 if not.

### Recovery Rate Examples

| Sanity | Recovery Rate | With a Bonus |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| 100%    | 0.0007/s       | 0.001/s       |
| 0%      | 0.001/s        | 0.0015/s      |

Dreadstone Helms and Dreadstone Armor do not regenerate durability while Enlightenment is active. This makes the helm less preferable for the Celestial Champion fight or any other lunar related combat, though their incredible durability and sanity drain make them useful so long as the player is mindful of the helm's durability.

## Skins

- **Horned Dreadstone Helm:** Woven - Elegant Shadow Collection. This helmet on your head will fill them with dread.

## Trivia

- Maxwell and Old Wanda do not lose sanity from wearing Dreadstone Helms.

If a Lightning Rod and a **Volt Goat** are in close vicinity in the **Reign of Giants** DLC, they both have an equal chance of being struck by Lightning.

In Don't Starve Together **WX-78** can use a recently-struck Lightning Rod to receive charge.

## Trivia
- The Lightning Rod was added in the **Doorway To Adventure** update.

- Wendy: Oh, that I may crush the world.
- WX-78: DECONSTRUCTION
- Wickerbottom: A worker's tool.

- Choose: Wendy

The **Hammer** is a **Tool** that can be used to demolish **Structures**. The Hammer requires 3 **Rocks**, 3 **Twigs**, and 2 **Rope** to craft and a **Science Machine** to prototype.

Hammers can break down any player-made Structures and most naturally occurring Structures such as **Pig Houses**, yielding at least 50% of the materials used to create the Structure in most cases.

If the player strikes a container such as a **Chest** or **Crock Pot**, all items within will fly out but remain undamaged. It also can be used on an **Ancient Pseudoscience Station** and **Ornate Chest**, both of which are found in the **Ruins**, to make random effects and objects appear.

## Downloadable Content
In all **DLC**s, the Hammer is tweaked so that it can be crafted without a device to prototype and requires 6 **Cut Grass** instead of 2 **Rope** to craft. This also applies to **Don't Starve Together**.

**Bones** can be hammered for **Bone Shards**, and hammering a **Merm Head**, a **Pig Head**, or a **Wildbore Head** during a **Full Moon** will yield **Nightmare Fuel**, as well as their usual items. The Hammer can also be used to "whack" **Moleworm**s, which will stun them.

## Usage
The Hammer can be used to break down structures by equipping it then right-clicking a structure. After the first right click, left mouse button or space bar can be held down to continue hammering until the structure breaks.

The Hammer can be used as a weapon, dealing 17 damage per strike. It has 75 uses, meaning each use will reduce 1.33% of its durability, whether it was used as a weapon or to deconstruct objects.

Using the Hammer on a Structure that has "uses" (e.g. the **Tent**) may return less than 50% of the materials used to craft it, based on how many times the Structure has been used. For structures that have usage, the amount returned for each type of ingredient is:
amount_returned = original_amount * percent_uses_left * 0.5

Hammering a structure will always yield at least one of each of the crafting materials, with the exception of **Walls**, which drop their main component instead. If the main component of the Wall is a **Refined** item, its base components are dropped instead. For example

As long as there are no Magic Waters or **Magic Flowers** that exist in the Hamlet world, the fountain will regenerate after 1 day and will spawn another Pugalisk if the previous one was killed.

Some **Teetering Pillars** and **Ancient Walls** can be found around the Fountain.

# Grass Suit

## Overview
The Grass Suit is the weakest wearable **Armor**, acting as an alternative to the **Log Suit**. It requires 10 **Cut Grass** and 2 **Twigs** to craft and is available from the beginning of the game.

## Specifications
- **Durability**: 225 hp
- **Protection**: 60%
- **Crafting Ingredients**: 10x **Cut Grass**, 2x **Twigs**
- **Stacking**: Does not stack

## Description
A Grass Suit has 225 durability and absorbs 60% of physical damage. Not considering the armor's durability, the Grass Suit effectively adds 225 **Hp** to the average survivor.

Also like the Log Suit, a Grass Suit can also be added to a **Campfire** or **Fire Pit** for **fuel**, even when its durability is nearly gone. Despite being acceptable fuel for Campfires and Fire Pits, a dropped Grass Suit will not catch fire.

## Skins
- **Woven - Elegant Feathered Grass Armor** and **Woven Grass Armor** skins were introduced during the official **The Forge** event in 2017.

## Trivia
- The Grass Suit was added in the **The End Is Nigh** update.
- A worn Grass Suit will make the sound of ruffling grass when walking.

# Lumpy Evergreens

![Normal](A Lumpy Evergreen.png) ![Stump](Evergreen Stump.png) 

Lumpy Evergreens are a variant of the typical [Evergreen](Tree/Evergreen) with lumpy and wilted-looking branches. Unlike normal Evergreens, the Lumpy variety does not produce [Pine Cones], leading [Characters] to wonder how it reproduces at all. They still have a life-cycle, growing to huge trees and then reverting to small ones. Also like normal trees, lumpy ones can become [Treeguards], which will have the lumpy appearance as opposed to the standard treeguard look. Like other trees, the stumps of the Lumpy Evergreen variety can be dug up with a [Shovel] or Regal Shovel to get an additional [Log].

## Characteristics

- **Tool:** Can be [Chopped](Tools#Chopping_Tools) with an Axe, Can be [Dug](Tools#Dug_Tools) with a Shovel (when Sapling or Stump)

# Nightmarish Bird Whistle
Exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, the Nightmarish Bird Whistle is a craftable item found in the Magic Tab. It requires a Bird Whistle and two Dark Tatters to craft, and a Hogus Porkusator to prototype.

## Item Info
- **Description:** Strikes fear into even the biggest birds.
- **Tab:** Magic
- **Tier:** 4
- **Durability:** 1 use ([Playing Tools](#))
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Ingredients:**
  - **Ingredient 1:** Bird Whistle (Multiplier: 1)
  - **Ingredient 2:** Dark Tatters (Multiplier: 2)
- **Perk:** Disables the natural spawning of the BFB.

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** This should scare off that big bird.
- **Willow:** Seeya round big birdie. Or not.
- **Wolfgang:** Birds not like it, makes scary sound!
- **Wendy:** It has a most haunting sound.
- **WX-78:** AVIAN ANXIETY INDUCER
- **Wickerbottom:** One bird in particular does not seem to enjoy it.
- **Woodie:** Bird repellant.
- **Maxwell:** This should rid me of that giant pest.
- **Wagstaff:** This model appears to deter the exceedingly large bird.
- **Wigfrid:** Calls off the mighty bird beast.
- **Webber:** The big birdie doesn't like the sounds it makes.
- **Walani:** Bye birdy birdy.
- **Warly:** Au revoir giant bird, no dinner for you!
- **Woodlegs:** Fer chasin' off tha big feather'd beastie.
- **Wilba:** BIG BIRDIE LIKETH NOT ITS SONG
- **Wormwood:** Scares Womp Tweeter
- **Wheeler:** This should make any giant birds steer clear.

## Tips
- Using the Nightmarish Bird Whistle can be helpful to prevent the periodic interruptions and base evacuations that the natural spawning of the BFB can cause.
- Note that this item will only affect future spawns; it will not cancel a naturally spawning BFB that is already currently descending.
- Because the BFB can still be called using the Bird Whistle, Dung Piles will remain renewable, and the player will still have access to the Pinacle if they had not visited it before using the Nightmarish Bird Whistle.
- As the Ancient Herald will only drop five Dark Tatters when it is defeated, the player may wish to remain in the Aporkalypse long enough to defeat it twice if they wish to have enough to craft both the Vortex Cloak and Nightmarish Bird Whistle.

# Magma Piles
Magma Piles are naturally-spawning **Structures** in the **Magma Field** and **Volcano** **Biomes** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They are piles of igneous rocks which may be dug using a **Shovel**, using 4% of the Shovel's durability per dig. They must be dug 6 times to be removed, and 2-3 items will drop every 2 shovel digs. The gold-flecked Magma Pile has a chance to drop **Gold Nuggets**, while the regular one can drop **Nitre**. Both types also drop **Rocks**, **Flint**, and very rarely, red or blue **Gems**. Sometimes a **Krissure**, a sort of flaming geyser, will erupt after digging up a pile. This chance is higher while in the Volcano than in the Magma Field. Upon a Krissure's eruption, the final dropped items will be scattered about half a screen away. Magma Piles in Volcano Biome are renewable, after they are dug, they would regrow to full in a year at the same location, if a Krissure did not erupt after being dug.

## Description
Wood Fences are wall-like structures located in the Structures Tab. 3 Twigs and 1 Rope are required to craft 6 Wood Fences. They are flammable and can be destroyed with a Hammer or any weapon. Together with Wood Gates, they can be used both for decorative uses and for making a cage for a Mob. However, flying Mobs cannot be trapped using Wood Fences, as they will simply fly over it.

Fences seem to try to connect to adjacent fences, and rotate by a 45 degree angle every time. This allows for more practical placement.

## Trivia
- Wood Fences were introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Cute Fuzzy Animals update during A New Reign. They were later added to Don't Starve in the Quality of Life update.
- Willow's quote for the wood fence is likely a reference to the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
- It is the first stackable item to get a Skin.
  - Skinned fences and not skinned ones do not stack in the Inventory.

# Webby Whistle

Exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, the **Webby Whistle** is a tool crafted by **Webber**. Webber starts with one Webby Whistle in **The Constant** and can craft more with 3 **Silk** and 2 **Twigs**. This tool allows Webber to wake up Spiders from nearby **Spider Den**s and any wandering Spiders. It does not work on **Spider Queen**s. Using the whistle also calls off any friendly spiders from what they're currently attacking, which can be useful for withdrawing allies from dangerous combat situations. Friendly Spiders hearing the whistle will temporarily ignore meat items on the ground, allowing players to save some or all of the meat from larger animals if used at the right time.

Ponds can be found in any part of the map, but they are most common in Marshes, Forests, and Grasslands. To begin fishing, drag and drop the Fishing Rod on the pond or equip the rod and click the pond, and the character will cast a line into the pond. After 5–40 seconds, the line will tug and the "Hook" option will appear. Clicking the left mouse button on the pond will hook the fish, and an additional click will reel it in.

## Downloadable Content
- In the Shipwrecked DLC, Shoals and Tidal Pools can also be fished. Both yield Tropical Fish, though Shoals have a chance of additionally spawning Crocodogs.
- In the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, Fishing Rods can be used to retrieve sunken Lost Relics in the Lily Pond Biome. They can be bought for ten Oincs in the Pigg and Pigglet's General Store in the Pig City.

## Tips
- When trying to fish in surface ponds, dangerous creatures will be present depending on the time of day. Grasslands Ponds will spawn Frogs during the day time, while Marsh Ponds will spawn Mosquitos during dusk and night.

## Trivia
- Maxwell's quote is likely a reference to the proverb "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime".

## Bugs
- Sometimes a glitch occurs where the fishing hooks ends up in the ground instead of the pond, depending on the direction the player is facing and proximity to the pond. This can be fixed by changing the position where the player was fishing.
- Sometimes when a Fish is reeled in but the character tries to pick up another item before it hits the ground, the Fish will disappear.
