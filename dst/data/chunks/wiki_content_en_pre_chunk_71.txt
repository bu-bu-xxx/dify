# Recipe Card

The **Recipe Card** is an item in *Don't Starve Together* that allows you to learn recipes. It can be found by naturally spawning in the world near the Skeleton, as well as by digging up Graves or opening Tumbleweeds and Sunken Chests. The recipe card merely lists its recipe when examined, it does not automatically add it to your Cookbook.

# Exclusivity: Shipwrecked

## Object Infobox

- **Woodie**: Thanks for the stuff, guy!
- **Maxwell**: It looks... rotten.

- **Wormwood**: Stuff from Big Arms guy!
- **Wheeler**: I have to admit, that's a cool magic trick.
- **Choose**: Wilson

## Octopus Chest
The **Octopus Chest** (also called **Octo Chest**) is a special **chest** **structure** pulled from the sea by **Yaarctopus** after trading with him. It has 4 storage slots. After the player empties the chest from items, it will sink into the ocean. For details on contents of the Octopus Chests, see [Yaarctopus Exchange Rates](Yaarctopus#Exchange Rates).

### Prototype Tips
- The Chest will not sink as long as it has any item inside. This can be used to the player's advantage when gathering items, especially **Trinkets**, with a **Trawl Net**. Before trawling, a cheap item can be put inside to prevent the chest from sinking. The player should then aim to finish trawling near Yaarctopus, so that any unused trinkets can be easily put in the chest for later trade.
- Trading additional trinkets with Yaarctopus will not cause any already existing Octopus Chests to sink, allowing multiple chests to be spawned. This further benefits the player by allowing virtually unlimited free storage near Yaarctopus.

### Placeholder Trivia
- When spawned with a console it will be empty, as the Yaarctopus is responsible for spawning the items in it.
- Octopus Chest can be moved by **Sealnado**.
- The Octopus Chest used to have 9 storage slots.
- The **Sea Chest** shares textures with the Octopus Chest.

## Butter
**Butter** is a rare Dairy Food item that has a 2% chance of being dropped by a Butterfly.

## Usage
Butter can be used in Crock Pot recipes that require any Dairy, such as Ice Cream. In addition, the following recipes specifically require Butter.

### Waffles
- **Butter**
- **Eggs**
- **Berry**
- **Filler**

### Fresh Fruit Crepes

- **Honey** (1)
- **Tool**: Portable Crock Pot

### Lobster Dinner (DST)
- **Butter**
- **Wobster (DST)**
- **Filler** (2)
- **Tool**: Crock Pot

## Tips
As Butter only comes from Butterflies, it's highly recommended not to pick flowers near one's base, as more flowers equates to more chances for Butter.

## Trivia
- The fact that it comes from Butterflies, as stated by Maxwell, is a pun on the word "Butterfly".
- Butter's striped appearance, and the fact that it comes from butterflies may also be a reference to the browser-based MMO Glitch, that ran from 2009 to 2012.
- Butter gave 80 research points when used on a Science Machine in the early beta of Don't Starve.
- Wilson's quote "I can't believe it's butter!" is a reference to the margarine brand "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!"

## Description
Rabbit Holes are the home and spawning place for [[Rabbits]]. They run back to their holes at dusk, or when they are frightened. When a Rabbit is captured or killed, another will eventually respawn from the hole. A Rabbit Hole can be dug up with a Shovel to force a Rabbit out; however, this will destroy the hole, preventing future Rabbits from spawning there. If a Rabbit is caught outside its hole after dark for any reason, it will fall asleep.

A Rabbit Hole will spawn a new rabbit every 2.5 days. Since a Morsel restores 12.5 hunger and the necessary calorie value per day is 75, this means that having access to 15 Rabbit Holes

Adding **Twigs** will result in **Wet Goop**. Adding 1 **Mandrake** will result in **Mandrake Soup**. Adding any **Dragon Fruit** will result in **Dragonpie**.

- **Carrots** x1 + **Berry** x3: Crock Pot → **Ratatouille**

## Tips
- **Ratatouille** is one of the few Crock Pot recipes that can be made from foods that have a neutral or negative effect, such as mushrooms and ice, providing a 100% bonus hunger advantage from eating those items separately.
- Eating the recipe ingredients cooked will almost always provide more benefits unless one needs a slight **Sanity** boost, wants to keep preserved food, or makes use the food types above.

## Trivia
- **Ratatouille**'s meager benefits and low Crock Pot priority implies that it is a sort of "consolation prize" for uncreative Crock Pot recipes.
- During the **Pig Fiesta** event in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, **Ratatouille** takes on a more festive appearance.
- **Ratatouille** is a peasant dish originating from Nice, France. It was a dish prepared by commoners because of the easy-to-come-by ingredients, somewhat reminiscent of how vegetables are often abundant in **Don't Starve**, especially in early-game.

# Fruit Medley

## Overview
![Fruit Medley Dropped](Fruit Medley Dropped.png)

- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Food Type**: Veggie
- **Food Recipe**: 3.0 Fruits + 1 Filler
- **Spoil Time**: 6 Days
- **Stack Size**: 40
- **HP Restored**: 20
- **Hunger Restored**: 25
- **Sanity Restored**: 5
- **Cook Time**: 10 seconds
- **Priority**: 0
- **Spawn Code**: fruitmedley

## Quotes
- Wilson: Fruity.
- Willow: Yum, fruit!
- Wolfgang: Is cup of teensy fruits.
- Wendy: Sweet, tart and in a cup.
- WX-78: ENERGY IN A CUP
- Wickerbottom: What a nice selection of fruit!
- Woodie: In syrup!
- Maxwell: This would pair great with a simple cheese plate.
- Wagstaff: A lovely concoction of consumables.
- Wigfrid: Ugh! Putting it into a cup doesn't fool me.
- Webber: Pile o'fruit.
- Walani: A sweet treat!
- Warly: Invigorating!
- Woodlegs: 'Tis a scrumptious little morsel.
- Wilba: FRUIT MAKETH WILBA PLOP
- Wormwood: Fruit party!
- Wheeler: A cup of cold crops.
- Winona: Gotta get those vitamins, I guess.
- Wortox: The mortals threw a bunch of plants together.
- Wurt: Fruit meldy... moldy... meddle-y?
- Walter: It's good for you!
- Wanda: Refreshing.

## Recipe
To make Fruit Medley, combine 3.0 units of Fruits (except Dragon Fruit, which results in Dragonpie) in a Crock Pot. If a Twig is not added, the recipe may result in Fist Full of Jam instead, as they share the same Crock Pot Priority. It takes 10 seconds to cook. Fruit Medley decreases the perceived temperature by 1 degree per second for 5 seconds.

- **Recipe Ingredients**:
  - 3.0 Fruits
  - 1 Filler (cannot be Meats or Vegetables)

### Variations
- Adding two or more Durian will result in Monster Lasagna unless a Twig is added.
- Adding Meats or Vegetables will result in Meatballs or Ratatouille respectively.
- As Berries have a fruit value of 0.5, this recipe cannot include more than 2 Berries.

### Examples
- 3 Durian + 1 Twig = Fruit Medley
- 3 Pomegranate + 1 Twig = Fruit Medley
- 2 Pomegranate + 2 Berries = Fruit Medley (50% chance to result in Fist Full of Jam)
- 3 Cave Bananas + 1 Ice = Fruit Medley (50% chance to result in Fist Full of Jam)

## Tips
- Since the individual hunger value of most compatible ingredients is higher than Fruit Medley itself, the use of a twig as filler is highly recommended to avoid accidentally making a Fist Full of Jam.
- Despite requiring a higher fruit value than Fist Full of Jam, Fist Full of Jam restores more hunger, as such, Fruit Medleys should be made for healing and cooling purposes as opposed to food over Fist Fulls of Jam.

## Bugs
- Fruit Medley does not exclude Fishes.

# Slurper Pelt

![Slurper Pelt](Slurper Pelt Dropped.png)

The **Slurper Pelt** is an item with a 50% chance to be dropped by [Slurper](Slurper.png). It can be used to craft a [Belt of Hunger]. Like meat items, a Slurper Pelt can be used to befriend a [Pig], or it can be exchanged with the [Pig King] for a [Gold Nugget]. However, [Bunnymen] don't count it as meat, and won't mind if a player has one/picks one up.

# Wilson's Field Notes

Wilson's Field Notes are a series of blog posts written by Kevin on the (now-defunct) *Don't Starve* webpage. They detail some of Wilson's survival experiences, and were posted from June to July 2012. Due to the various changes the *Don't Starve* franchise has been through since, it's unknown if Wilson's Field Notes are canonical.

## New Tools

This entry was posted on June 25, 2012.[Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20120628002943/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/blog/) in June 2012

![New Tools Field Note](https://example.com/New_Tools_Field_Note.jpg "New Tools Field Note")

"I am a scientist, not a labourer! I’m used to probing the depths of the universe with the power of my mind, not digging holes and chopping down trees. But I’m also used to having walls and a roof, so I suppose one must make allowances for circumstance."

"I should be able to put together some simple tools using the twigs and flint that litter the ground here. I may be reduced to living off the sweat of my brow, but at least I don’t have to do so with my bare hands."

## Beefalo

This entry was posted on July 5, 2012.[Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20120902232115/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/blog/) in July 2012

![Beefalo Field Note](https://example.com/Beefalo_Field_Note.jpg "Beefalo Field Note")

"I stumbled across a herd of these brutes today while I was hunting rabbits. When one noticed me I was certain that I was a goner, but it soon lost interest and resumed eating."

"The Beefalo spend almost all of their time eating. What little time they don’t spend eating they spend performing the *other* aspect of the digestive process. The stench of a Beefalo herd cannot be described with polite language, although the dung is quite useful in small quantities."

"I’m tired of eating rabbits. Tonight I shall try hunting a Beefalo instead. Their docile nature should make them an excellent food source..."

## Meat Effigy

This entry was posted on July 31, 2012.[Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20120902232115/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/blog/)

![Meat Effigy Field Note](https://example.com/Meat_Effigy_Field_Note.png "Meat Effigy Field Note")

"I am in an environment much harsher than that to which I am accustomed. Everything here is trying to kill me, or eat me, or... worse. It’s almost as bad as graduate school!"

"If I am to survive this place, I fear I must resort to drastic measures. That’s okay, though, for I am a Scientist, and my Science is nothing if not drastic. I think that if I build a wooden effigy of myself, and fill it full of meat, I can create an insurance policy against violent death. It’s a technique that’s well-known amongst the scientific community."

"Maybe I should throw in some of my beard hairs as well. It couldn’t hurt!"

# Soul (Don't Starve Together)

## Structure Info
- **Name**: Soul
- **Icon**: Soul.png
- **Image**: Soul Dropped.png
- **HP Restored**: 20 - 5 (When released)
- **Stack**: 20
- **Spawn Code**: "wortox_soul"
- **Hunger Restored**: 25 (When eaten)
- **Sanity Restored**: -5 (When eaten), 2.5 (When released)

## Wortox Quote
> "Hyuyu! It looks tasty." - Wortox

## Scrapbook Info
Wortox can eat these to restore 25 Hunger and lose 5 Sanity. They can be released to heal all survivors nearby, with a maximum healing of 20 health which drops 2 points for each extra survivor to a minimum of 5 health. He can also spend Souls to Soul Hop, which teleports him. If Wortox holds more than 20 Souls, he will release half of them and lose 20 Sanity.

## Description
A **Soul** is an item exclusive to **Wortox** in *Don't Starve Together*. It spawns when a mob or other player dies within 20 units of Wortox. It will flow to Wortox when he is within 8 units of the Soul. If it is not collected within 10 seconds, it will disappear. They can be consumed by Wortox for 25 Hunger at the cost of 5 Sanity. When released, the Soul will heal Wortox and allies within 8 units. The maximum healing is 20 HP, and the minimum is 5 HP. Each additional player decreases the value by 2, until the minimum is reached.

Wortox can spend one Soul to be able to Soul Hop, or teleport, a short distance. This functions in the same manner as the Lazy Explorer, except it does not cost any Sanity. When Soul Hopping twice in a short time span, called "Soul Echo", the second one will not cost another Soul. At the cost of Souls, Wortox can also right-click anywhere on the Map to teleport to that space, if it has already been explored. The cost of the teleport is equivalent to the amount of Soul Hops and Soul Echoes required to get there manually, and is indicated by a text below the cursor.

If Wortox tries to hold more than 20 Souls at once, he will drop half of them and lose 20 Sanity. He gives warnings about holding too many Souls before it happens. The dropped Souls will heal Wortox and the allies next to him. It is not possible to store Souls in any container or Backpack to avoid this. If it is attempted, it will make the same sound as if it was rejected in a Crock Pot. Other characters cannot hold Souls, and they cannot inspect them.

## Mobs and Souls
| Mob | Amount of Souls |
| --- | --- |
| WX-78, Clockwork Mobs, Shadow Creatures, Shadow Pieces, Shadow Puppets, Balloons, Walls, Structures, Lureplant, Relics, Baby Tentacles, Bernie (all forms) | None |
| Most Mobs and characters excluding WX-78 and Webber | 1 |
| Webber | 2 |
| Boss Monsters (Deerclops, Bearger, Moose/Goose, Dragonfly, etc.) | 7-8 |

## Trivia
- The icon of the Soul is similar in shape to that of the Nightmare Fuel.
- WX-78 will not drop any soul, as they have none.
- Webber will drop two souls, implying the boy and the spider he's composed of remain two separate entities.

## Bugs
- On Console, characters other than Wortox can pick up and inspect Souls using their default quote for items that they have no string for ("It's a... thing."). In other characters' inventories, Souls can stack to 40.

# Pherostone

## Exclusivity
- Exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC.

## Item Infobox
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Perk**: Translates Mant speech.
- **Spawn Code**: "pheromonestone"

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: A nasaltelepathical bug communicator.
- **Wendy**: Let my words be known to those who creep and crawl.
- **Wx78**: CONTAINS SOURCE CODE FOR INSECTOIDS
- **Wickerbottom**: I will uncover the secrets of arthropod speech.

- **Wheeler**: Now I can make small talk with the big bugs.
- **Choose**: wickerbottom

The **Pherostone** is a naturally spawning **Item** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It can be found once per world in the **Ancient Pig Ruins**, more specifically the ones that have a Mant statue on top of the Ruinous Entrance in the **Gas Rainforest**.

### Usage
When carried in any **Inventory** slot, it allows the player to understand what **Mant**s are saying. The Pherostone does not prevent Mants from being aggressive. Mants can be befriended by using the Pherostone to determine which food they eat, and then feeding the corresponding meat, seeds, plants, or wood. Befriended Mants will assist the player in chopping down **Trees** and attacking **Mobs**.

### Crafting
The Pherostone cannot be crafted.

## Tips
- The Pherostone does not work if it is stored in a **Backpack**.
- The Pherostone does not have an icon on the **Map**, so the player should carefully check every room.

## Trivia
- According to character quotes, the Pherostone appears to work by translating scents into language.
- Its name is a portmanteau of the words "Pheromone" and "stone".
  - The first making a reference to the way insects like ants and termites communicate with each other with pheromone signals.
  - The second is a reference to the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone), a stele written in three different languages (hieroglyphic or Ancient Egyptian, Demotic, and Ancient Greek) with minor differences among the three texts which was key to the first deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs and uncovering ancient Egyptian history (like the Pherostone with Mants' language).

# Tallbird Nest

The **Tallbird Nest** is a naturally occurring object that randomly spawns in **Rockyland** and **Magma Field** biomes. Tallbirds will also spawn with nests (one Tallbird per nest) and will lay **Tallbird Eggs** there. Tallbirds can create new nests.

- **Wanda**: "I spot an egg! Although it looks like it was spotted already."

## Behavior

- The Egg can be taken from the nest, which will anger the owning Tallbird and make it chase the player.
- The Tallbird will lay another one after 3-5 days, and if killed, the Tallbird will respawn in 2.5 days.
- The Egg can hatch into an adult Tallbird if it is unharvested and the parent Tallbird is dead.
- At dusk, Tallbirds return to their nests to sleep, though they will wake up if anyone goes near them for a short duration or takes their Eggs.

## Tips

- One must be prepared to kill or run away from the Tallbird after taking its egg, as it will pursue for a very long time.
- If the player jumps into a **Wormhole**, the Tallbird cannot follow, making it easy to steal their Egg this way.

## Trivia

- According to **Maxwell**, Tallbird Nests are made out of **Beefalo Wool**: "It's made of dirty beefalo hair."

Lichen cannot be cooked at a **[Fire Pit](Fire%20Pit)**, **[Campfire](Campfire)**, or **[Star Caller's Staff](Star%20Caller's%20Staff)**, but it can be used as an ingredient in a **[Crock Pot](Crock%20Pot)**. Lichen regrows after 5 days.

Lichen can be eaten raw and restores 3 **[HP](HP)** and 12.5 **[Hunger](Hunger)**, at the cost of 5 **[Sanity](Sanity)**. The Sanity penalty can be avoided by using it in a **[Crock Pot](Crock%20Pot)** instead. The **[Unagi](Unagi)** recipe for the **[Crock Pot](Crock%20Pot)** specifically requires Lichen, however, Lichen can also be used as a filler. Lichen spoils very quickly and becomes **[Rot](Rot)** 2 days after being harvested.

As of the **[Return of Them|Eye of the Storm](Return%20of%20Them|Eye%20of%20the%20Storm)** beta, Lichen can be fed to **[Beefalo](Beefalo)** and **[Pig](Pig)**s.

## Quote

"Freedom suits me." - Maxwell

## Unlocking

Maxwell is playable for free in Don't Starve Together.

## Unique Items

Maxwell starts a new world with a Codex Umbra and 6 Nightmare Fuel.

| Item | Utility |
| ---- | ------ |
| ![Codex Umbra](/Codex%20Umbra.png) | Maxwell can use the Codex to create various Shadow Puppets and Shadow Traps, at the cost of Sanity. Puppets reduce Maxwell's maximum Sanity by 15% (-30) each until they disappear, while Traps instantly drain -15 Sanity. The Codex has a durability of 20 uses, but can be repaired using Nightmare Fuel. |
| ![Magician's Top Hat](/Magician's%20Top%20Hat.png) | Equipped in the Head slot. Has the same effects as a Top Hat, but Maxwell can use it to access the Shadow Dimension. |
| ![Magician's Chest](/Magician's%20Chest.png) | Storage Structure connected to the Shadow Dimension. There can only be one Chest per server. |

## Perks

- Maxwell has a constant positive Sanity effect of +6.75 Sanity/min, and is immune to negative Sanity effects from Shadow Items.
- Maxwell can read Books and use their abilities, but suffers an increased Sanity penalty than Wickerbottom of 2.5x.
- Maxwell's favourite food is Wobster Dinner, which restores an additional +15 Hunger than usual.

## Tips

### Codex Umbra

- During the first few days, it is effective to find an area with many Stage 3 Trees or Boulders, then summon several Shadow Servants to harvest them. This will allow Maxwell to attain large amounts of items for minimal resources, especially if he lacks materials to craft certain tools.
- Shadow Servants make Maxwell one of the best characters for mass-clearing tree farms, alongside Woodie. With only one or two Servants, it is possible to attain more than 70 Logs within a short time, with stumps automatically dug up without any player effort. For this reason, he is also great for crafting anything that requires Boards, such as Chests and Boat Kits.
- Summoning multiple Puppets to reduce maximum Sanity is a good way to get Maxwell to stay almost insane for long periods of time, which is not easily obtained normally due to his Sanity regain buff. However, note that Shadow Duelists will not help Maxwell with fighting Shadow Creatures, similar to most other followers.
- Shadow Duelists can be used as an efficient, albeit expensive, method to kill passive mobs. For example, they can be used near flowers to kill Butterflies, near Berry Bushes to kill Gobblers, or near Rabbit Holes for Morsels. Birds can survive a hit from one duelist (since they do 20 damage, and birds have 25 health).

### Other

- Since Maxwell has a natural regeneration of Sanity, players are recommended to do sanity-consuming things that other players would suffer from. For example: picking Evil Flowers, using Magic and Ancient Items, or eating sanity draining Food.
- Sanity-regenerating items such as the Tam o' Shanter, Tent, Taffy etc. are unnecessary for Maxwell. This allows him to wear armor such as the Football Helmet while still rapidly regaining Sanity. This also makes exploring during the Night or in Caves and Ruins ideal as the Sanity drain from darkness is negated.
- Due to Maxwell's low maximum Health, it is advised to have revival items on standby. Life Giving Amulets allow him to revive on the spot, but at the cost of Nightmare Fuel, which he might need to fuel the Codex Umbra. Meat Effigies can let him revive near base, but requires sacrificing more than half his current health, and requires the relatively rare Beard

# Blueprint

## Overview
A **Blueprint** is an **Item** that enables the player to learn a craftable recipe without having to prototype it first. When used, it restores 15 sanity. Blueprints themselves do not create an item; they only allow the player to craft the item away from the station normally used to prototype it.

# Terrorclaw

![Terrorclaw](Terrorclaw.png)

- **Damage**: 50
- **Health**: 400
- **Drops**: Nightmare Fuel (1-2)
- **Attack Period**: 3
- **Attack Range**: 4.1
- **Run Speed**: 2
- **Sanity Aura**: -100
- **Spawns From**: ![Terrorbeak](Terrorbeak.png)
- **Special Ability**: Turn back into Terrorbeak on land.
- **Spawn Code**: "oceanhorror"
- **Shadow Aligned**: 1

The **Terrorclaw** is an exclusive mob in *Don't Starve Together*, introduced in the *Return of Them* expansion.

## Behavior

At low sanity levels (below 10%), Terrorclaws spawn in place of Terrorbeaks and Crawling Horrors for players sailing the ocean. When a player lands, all Terrorclaws following them transform into Terrorbeaks. Conversely, Terrorbeaks transform into Terrorclaws when the player boards a boat.

Terrorclaws only move in the water and teleport close to the player to attack. When attacked, they do not disappear and continue to attack the player.

Killing a Terrorclaw regenerates 15 sanity and drops 1 Nightmare Fuel plus a 50% chance of an extra one.

## Trivia

- Wavey Jones and Terrorclaws were introduced in the *Return of Them#Troubled Waters* update.

## Description
A **Durian** is a rare fruit food item. It can be cooked on a fire into an Extra Smelly Durian and can also be used as an ingredient in Crock Pot recipes. Durians can be farmed from Farm Plots. Regular Seeds have a 5% chance of growing Durians. Durian Seeds can be gained by feeding a Durian to Birds in a Birdcage, which can produce 1–2 Durian Seeds as well as a 50% chance to get normal Seeds.

Like Monster Meat, raw Durian damages health and sanity, and also affects Crock Pot recipes. It can be used as a fruit/any filler in Crock Pot recipe with no toxic effects, but using more than 1 Durian in a Crock Pot recipe could result in Monster Lasagna unless the recipe contains Twigs or has higher priority.

Webber will still take the health and sanity penalties from eating Durians.

In Don't Starve Together, both versions of the Durian are Wurt's favorite food, gaining extra 23.25 Hunger upon consumption, without losing sanity or health. However, pumpkin remains the filling crop for Wurt, providing 50 Hunger, compared to 48.25 Hunger from Durian.

They can be grown from Brittle Seed Pods.

They can also be fed to Woby to turn her into Big Woby.

# Dung Ball

## Exclusivity
![Hamlet](#)

## Object Infobox
- **Name:** Dung Ball
- **Image:** ![Dung Ball.png](#)
- **Resources:**
  - Manure (100%)
  - Flint (70%)
  - Rocks (70%)
  - Twigs (8%)
  - Cut Grass (6%)
  - Seeds (3%)
  - Lost Idol (0.6%)
- **Renew:** Yes
- **Spawn Code:** dungball

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** Most definitely poop.
- **Willow:** Can’t even set it on fire.
- **Wolfgang:** Is ball of poop.
- **Wendy:** Grotesque.
- **WX-78:** ORGANIC WASTE SPHERE
- **Wickerbottom:** A perfectly spherical specimen of feces.
- **Woodie:** Dung to go.
- **Maxwell:** I refuse to touch that.
- **Wagstaff:** Excellent! The act of rolling has picked up a motley of paraphernalia.
- **Wigfrid:** What sickness is this?
- **Webber:** Yuck!
- **Walani:** Should’ve leashed it.
- **Warly:** Non.
- **Woodlegs:** Throw it o’erboard!
- **Wilba:** SWOLLER PARCEL OF PLOPSIES
- **Wormwood:** Yay! Ball of poop!
- **Wheeler:** Huh. It's almost like nobody wants a ball of poop.
- **Choose:** wickerbottom

The **Dung Ball** is an object mostly made of **Manure**, created from **Dung Piles** by **Dung Beetles**. Once created, the Dung Beetle will climb on the top of its ball, making it roll all over the place. If the player gets too close of it, the Dung Beetle will flee, sometimes knocking into something and falling off its ball. The player can then harvest it.

Digging a Dung Ball will always yield 3 items, and at least one of them will be **Manure**. Other common resources are **Flint** or **Rocks** (which can be found almost every time). More rarely, one can found **Grass Tuft**, **Twigs**, or **Seeds**. The rarest item that can be dug in a Dung Ball is a **Lost Idol**.

## Tips
To preserve the Rocks and Flints renewal to a maximum, the best strategy is to kill a **Dung Beetle**, then harvest its **Dung Ball**. If it is not killed, it will go to the nearest **Dung Pile**, destroying it to make a new Dung Ball out of it. As Dung Piles are only renewable via **BFB**, it is recommended not to destroy them.

Surf 'n' Turf is a Meat item included in Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. It is cooked in the Crock Pot by adding any Meats and Fishes with a total Fish value of 1.5 or higher and a total Meat value of all the ingredients of 2.5 or higher. Surf 'n' Turf restores 60 Hp, 37.5 Hunger, and 33 Sanity. Multiple Monster Meats can be used in the recipe (as long as the recipe requirements are met) without the fear of making Monster Lasagna, since Surf 'n' Turf recipe has a higher priority than Monster Lasagna. Surf 'n' Turf is the favorite food of Wickerbottom, and consuming it will restore her extra 15 Hunger.
