## Scrapbook Info
Wearer will perform boat activities faster and uses half as much oar durability.

The **Pirate's Bandana** is a **Hat** **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** introduced in **The Curse of Moon Quay** update.

It is dropped by killing a **Powder Monkey** if it's wearing one. The Bandana allows the player to more quickly do various boat-related actions. This includes raising and lowering the **Mast** and raising the **Anchor** twice as fast as usual. While worn it also uses only half the **durability** of an **Oar** when rowing. The Pirate's Bandana now also makes you turn Steering Wheels more quickly.

Powder Monkeys have a 30% chance to spawn with a Bandana equipped. Pirate's Bandanas are not flammable.

# Birds

**Quote:** "Does that mean winter is gone?" - Wilson when examining the Redbird after winter.

Birds are passive Mobs. They can be found in every biome during the Day and Dusk. They fly down from off-screen and peck the ground for a few moments, then fly away. When they take flight, there is a chance that Seeds are left behind, unless it's Winter or in interiors. Birds will also be attracted to Seeds left on the ground. If the player or most other mobs get too close, birds will be frightened away. Birds won't land on Sticky Webbing and will swiftly fly away if they already lands.

When killed, birds drop a Morsel or a Feather, and all other birds nearby will fly away. They are considered innocent creatures and killing them directly adds points to the player's naughtiness level, which causes Krampus to appear. Killing a Crow adds 1 point to the player's naughtiness level while killing a Redbird or Snowbird adds 2 points to the player's naughtiness level.

## Downloadable Content

In all DLCs, Birds inside the player's inventory will starve in 2 days unless they are fed Seeds.

In the Shipwrecked and Hamlet DLCs, Birds take 100 poison damge per interval instead of normal 2. Birds won't land on flooding tiles, and will swiftly fly away if they already lands and the flooding spreads.

## Hunting

Birds can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one. They can be Murdered by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel. Birds in the player's inventory can be dropped on the ground and will flop on the ground belly-up for a short while before flying off. They can also be imprisoned in Bird Cages.

Hunting Birds requires a ranged weapon such as a Boomerang. Birds will not land within melee range (even if bait is placed on the ground) and will fly away when the player approaches. However, if they are put to sleep when using characters with a normal damage modifier, they can be killed in 1 hit with a sufficient melee weapon.

If a bird is in flight while in range of a sleeping item's effect, it will plummet to the ground and can be picked up as an item.

Wearing a Feather Hat will increase the number of Birds spawning as well as decreasing the time between spawns. Using Birds of the World (while playing as Wickerbottom) will also cause a large number of them to land.

One can send a Smallbird to attack a Bird. This can be done without the bird getting frightened and without raising naughtiness.

They take one blast from the Ice Staff to be frozen and one Sleep Dart to be put to sleep.

## Bird List

- Crow
- Redbird
- Snowbird
- Parrot
- Parrot Pirate
- Seagull
- Toucan
- Cormorant
- Kingfisher
- Parrot (Hamlet)
- Pigeon (Hamlet)
- Canary
- Puffin
- Misshapen Bird
- Moonblind Crow
- Pigeon

## Tips

- When bait-trapping Birds for their Feathers, players should make sure to do so on Turfs in which specific Birds will spawn, so that they get specific Feathers.
- If one can manage to bring a Damaged Bishop from the Ruins, their ranged blasts are an effective tool to hunt birds without expending resources on Bird Traps or Boomerangs.
- If the player doesn't want any Feathers from the Birds, cooking them alive provides a guaranteed Cooked Morsel.
- If placed in a Hamlet interior, birds will flop around on the floor, upside down. They will not fly away and can be picked up again.

## Trivia

- Before the Naughty and Nice update, the Redbird was called "Red Bird".
- Cormorants were added to SW more than a year after its official completion in the Home Sea Home update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.
- Canaries were introduced in the Warts and All update.
- Puffins were introduced in the Turn of Tides update.
- The Snowbird is referenced as a "Winter Robin" or "Junco" in game files. A junco is a small North American bird, unrelated to the robin.
- The Snowbird's coloration and crest are reminiscent of the Blue Jay (a member of the crow's family, Corvidae).
- The red parrot appears to be based on the green-winged macaw.
- The Toucan appears to be based in part on yellow-throated toucans.

# Spring

## Exclusivity
Reign of Giants | Don't Starve Together

## Description
Spring is one of the four seasons from the Reign of Giants DLC, indicated in appearance by the world having a greenish tint.

It has a 50% chance to be the starting season instead of Autumn when playing in Sandbox Mode. With the Default Preferences, it lasts 20 days. Therefore, the first Spring lasts either from day 1 to 20, or from day 37 to 56. During the beginning and especially the middle of Spring, Dusks are very long (affecting player's sanity) but they quickly go shorter towards the last third of the season. Stages in Adventure Mode may have different seasonal variations. Some characteristics in the world change in Spring, and surviving can become more difficult.

## Changes in the World
- During Spring, Mini Glaciers will begin to melt and Bees will become red and more hostile (though they are still not considered Killer Bees).

- Beefalos will enter mating phase and stay in the mating phase for the full season.

[![Spring giant: Moose/Goose](attachment:Spring_RoG_poster.png)](Spring depicted in a promotional image for Reign of Giants.)

- Flowers will randomly spawn during spring even when there are no insects around.

- Rabbit Holes close during Spring, forcing the player to look for a different food source.

- The Moose/Goose and its nest can be encountered during Spring.

- Lureplants will naturally spawn in areas that the player has explored. Additionally, Beefalos will always be in heat and Blue Hounds can spawn with Hound waves.
- Wormwood will start to bloom during this season.
- Maximum chase time and range for enemies is increased by 33%.
- Trees take 25% less time to grow to next stage and all plants that produce non-edible resources, e.g. Grass Tufts, Reeds and Saplings (as well as Bull Kelp and Gloomthorn, despite giving edible produce) take 25% less time to regrow.

## Rain and its effects
Spring is the season where rain is very frequent and puddles form on the ground that will completely dry out in Summer.

Constant rain means that fuel is less efficient when lighting fires and more of it is needed to maintain a fire. In particular way, WX-78 players must be more aware of this menace because of the damage taken from water and Wetness. Additionally, Lightning strikes are much more frequent in Spring and can cause damage to the player (though representing an advantage for WX-78) or to unprotected structures vulnerable to fire. There is also a chance of Frog Rain occurring.

While temperature is not an issue at this time of year, the player will occasionally freeze due to wetness, especially during the start of the season because of the low temperatures.

Rain from the surface seeps into the soil, causing the Caves and Ruins to drip water from their ceiling, having the same effect as rain (this means higher Sanity Loss to account for), albeit the Wetness meter will rise significantly slower. Note that rain in the underground is constant in Spring and will keep going on until the season ends.

Frequent rain makes tracking Koalephants and other creatures from Suspicious Dirt Piles more difficult due to tracks disappearing.

Meats hung on a Drying Rack won't dry if it's raining. Other than that, the drying process will become slower due to humidity.

On the positive side, rain causes crops to grow much quicker and Mushrooms can be picked more frequently as rain causes them to regenerate.

## Tea Description
Tea is a Crock Pot dish introduced in the Hamlet DLC. It requires at least two Orange Pikos and 1 Sweetener, and excluding Meats, Vegetables, Twigs, and Ice. Adding ice will instead result in Iced Tea.

Tea restores 3 Health, 12.5 Hunger and 33 Sanity when consumed. It also increases the player's temperature by 15 and their walking speed by 2.5 (half as much as Coffee) for 2 minutes.

Tea spoils into Iced Tea instead of Rot after one day.

## Description
Mussels are a Fish Food Item introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. They can be harvested from Mussel Beds that are found in the Shallow Ocean using a Mussel Stick or a Trawl Net. Mussels can be used as an ingredient in Crock Pot recipes. Warly needs them to cook Mussel Bouillabaise in his Portable Crock Pot. Additionally, Mussels can also be used to craft a new Mussel Bed that can be planted in the Ocean by the player.

## Cooked Mussel
### Quotes (when examining a Cooked Mussel)
- **Wilson**: I cook a mean mussel.
- **Willow**: The fire opens their shell.
- **Wolfgang**: Mussels become protein for muscles!
- **Wendy**: I sure strong-armed this mussel.
- **WX-78**: FLAVOR MOLECULES ARE STRONG

- **Wheeler**: Tiny little snacks from the sea.

The Cooked Mussel is a fish food item made by cooking a Mussel on a Campfire, Fire Pit, Star, Chiminea, or Obsidian Fire Pit. They do not deduct Sanity, unlike their raw counterpart, restore a tiny bit of health, and take longer to spoil. They can also be used as an ingredient in several Crock Pot recipes, in which they will give 0.5 Fish Value.

### Icon Tools Usage
- **Mussel** → **Cooked Mussel** (Cooking)
- **Mussels** → **Octopus Chest** (Yaarctopus Icon)
- **Mussels** → **Birdcage** (Egg)
- **2 Mussels + 2 Vegetables** → **Mussel Bouillabaise** (Portable Crock Pot)
- **Mussel + Coral** → **Mussel Bed

## {{Quote|Hmmm. I wonder if these will burn.|Willow}}

## Unlocking
Willow is unlocked after accumulating 160 XP (total of 8 days' survival).

## {{Pic|48|Willow Filter}} Unique Items
Willow starts a new world with her [[Willow's Lighter|Lighter]].

| Item | Effect |
|------|--------|
| {{Pic|64|Willow's Lighter}} | Equipped in the Hand slot. Has similar utility to a [[Torch]], but has infinite durability in exchange for a smaller light radius. Willow gains +0.6 {{sanity}}/min while she has it equipped. |

## Perks
- Willow is immune to fire damage from all sources, whether they be standing too close to fire, being lit on fire, or extinguishing a smoldering object.
- Willow gains a positive [[Sanity]] effect from being near fire; The effect depends on the size of the fire, capping at +10/min for a raging fire. The effect stacks if multiple fires are nearby.

## Disadvantages
- While at ≤60 (50%) Sanity, Willow will randomly light small fires at her feet with no warning, which can quickly spread out of control and cause wildfires. In worst-case scenarios, this may result in the complete destruction of player bases, so Willow's Sanity must be maintained at all times to prevent such accidents.

## {{pic|32|Prototype}} Tips
{{Main|Guides/Character guide-Willow}}
- There is no cap to the amount of sanity/min that Willow can gain from multiple fires. So the player can drop multiple flammable items nearby ( [[Grass]], [[Logs]] etc.) and then set them on fire to gain massive amounts of sanity and warmth. Note that a single stack counts as a single fire, so any items will need to be dropped separately.
  - On the console version, the drop command can be used to drop all items in the same spot as separate stacks. With enough items, sanity can be instantly restored.
  - This is only really worth it in versions of the game where one can construct an [[Ice Flingomatic]], which can preserve the items at little cost.
- An Ice Flingomatic can help prevent base fires caused by Willow's low sanity.
- Due to her immunity to fire, Willow can set ablaze items in her inventory to regain sanity, get warm, produce a large light radius bigger than all other portable sources, and/or do serious damage to any mob susceptible to fire close by. Care must be taken to avoid getting close to flammable objects while doing this.
  - [[Saplings]] or [[Grass Tufts]] have a nearly 30 second burn time, making them ideal for this strategy. Once more, a stack that's on fire counts as a single fire, regardless of its size.
  - A flaming stack of items can be extinguished by combining it with another stack (even if that stack is on fire as well). However, combining a non-flaming stack with a flaming stack will do nothing.
- Other light sources are still important. Torches, the [[Miner Helmet]] and the [[Lantern]] are still necessary for situations where a flaming item can cause unwanted fires, but a larger light source than the lighter is needed.

## Tips

- If one does not have a reliable source of honey, this can be a reliable means for recovering sanity. However, the ingredients required can provide more hunger when cooked individually, so it's a trade-off one should consider when planning their diet.
- In Don't Starve Together, if one has an Onion and a Toma Root, then Salsa Fresca should be considered instead of this dish, as it requires 0.5 less vegetable value, while having the same benefits.

## Trivia

- Vegetable Stinger was introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Warly Character Update.
- During the Pig Fiesta event in Hamlet, Spicy Vegetable Stinger takes on a more festive appearance.

# Boats in Don't Starve: Shipwrecked

## Overview
A variety of boats can be constructed in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** for exploring the **Ocean** biomes and moving between islands. They may also be found abandoned in the Ocean (possibly even with attached items). The boats lose durability over time when moving on water. The rate of the loss can be reduced by wearing a **Captain Hat**. The durability is also lost when the boat hits small **Waves** in directions other than the wave is traveling, and when hitting large Waves, regardless of the direction. While the player is on a boat, attacks against the player do not reduce **Health**, instead the boat loses durability. When the boat durability hits 0, the player **drowns**, unless they are wearing a **Life Jacket**.

Inspecting a boat without riding it allows the player to see the boat's durability, equip attachments if the boat allows it, and access its inventory in the case of a **Cargo Boat** and **Encrusted Boat**. All boats, except the **Surfboard**, can be **Hammer**ed to get back half of the resources used to create it, regardless of its durability. Any attached items will be dropped.

Boats can be repaired using **Boat Repair Kits** or sailing near a **Sea Yard**. Continuously repairing a boat requires more resources than using a Boat until it is heavily damaged, breaking it down to get half the resources back, and building a new one. However, waiting until the boat has been heavily damaged increases the risk for an unexpected attack or a large Wave to break the boat.

Different boats will give different map reveal bonuses. Wearing a **Pirate Hat** increases this bonus by 200%. Boats also have [Hit Immunity](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/219740/view/2919977626398219425) that protects the player from being stun-locked.

## Downloadable Content
In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, boats can be used to traverse the **Lily Pond** biome.

## Bugs
* In the **Hamlet** DLC when player is hit by an attack at a precise moment while jumping on a boat at **Lily Pond**, the character will land and be able to move for brief moment on the pond. While character is at move, it will be teleported to the land towards where character is headed towards. This allows transitioning to an adjacent land that normally would not allow a player to cross to by foot.

# Wolfgang

![Wolfgang](Wolfgang.png)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health    | 150 to 300 |
| Hunger    | 300 |
| Sanity    | 200 |
| Damage    | 0.5× to 2× |
| Hunger Multiplier | -1× to -3× |
| Sanity Multiplier | -1.1× |
| Spawn Code | wolfgang |

## Unlocking
Wolfgang is unlocked after accumulating 320 XP (total of 16 days survived).

## Mightiness
Wolfgang's main gimmick is that depending on his current hunger, his body becomes stronger or weaker, granting physical buffs or penalties that correspond. He has three stages of Mightiness, which are described below:

- **Regular:** Wolfgang begins every new world at 200 hunger, and will stay slim and fit at 100-225 hunger. His maximum HP is 200, and he has base physical damage and movement speed of 100% each. In this form, Wolfgang's hunger drains at an increased rate of 150%.
- **Wimpy:** If Wolfgang's hunger is 99 or lower, he becomes skinny and weak. As his hunger depletes, Wolfgang's maximum HP drops to as low as 150, he deals as low as 50% of base physical damage, and he moves at a reduced movement speed of 90%. This is the only form which doesn't affect Wolfgang's hunger drain.
- **Mighty:** If Wolfgang's hunger is 226 or higher, he becomes dramatically stronger and larger, to the point that his upper body muscles tear through his clothes. As his hunger increases, Wolfgang's maximum HP rises to as high as 300, he deals anywhere from 125% to 200% of base physical damage, and he moves at an increased movement speed of 125%. In this form, Wolfgang's hunger drains at an astoundingly increased rate of 300%.

## Disadvantages
- Wolfgang will stop and show an animation when changing between forms, leaving him vulnerable for several seconds. This can be extremely dangerous if Wolfgang is fleeing from hostile entities when the animation plays.
- Wolfgang is also a severe nyctophobic. Negative sanity drains from both darkness and monsters will affect Wolfgang at an increased rate of 110%.

## Prototype Tips
* A Belt of Hunger will nullify Wolfgang's Hunger problems. This along with the fact that it provides some Sanity regeneration and extends his Mighty form to last about 5 minutes and a half, makes it an excellent item for this Character.
* In the Reign of Giants (RoG) DLC players are able to craft a Hibearnation Vest which also provides a Hunger drain reduction albeit not as big as the Belt of Hunger. That said, the Hibearnation Vest provides the highest insulation against cold and more than twice the Sanity regeneration of the Belt, making it more desirable in Winter even after the player has secured a Belt of Hunger.
* The above items are not obtainable in the Shipwrecked (SW) DLC until players find the Seaworthy and travel to a vanilla/RoG world. Until then, players can easily kill and feed on Crabbits and Jellyfish along with the easily collected Limpets and Seaweed. The abundance of those sources of food makes it possible to keep Wolfgang in his Mighty form while exploring.
* In DS, when the player is lacking Hunger drain reduction items, it is advised they stay with as low a Hunger level as possible during general gameplay and only eat to avoid starvation or just before a fight. That way they'll avoid the big Hunger drain of the Normal and Mighty forms and be out of danger since the penalties when staying Wimpy are only relevant during a fight.
* Since Wolfgang's Sanity drain penalty only applies to the dark and Monsters and is so small, it's fairly easy to overcome. Even in a "Light's Out" world, picking a Flower a day will even out the Sanity drain with other Characters. When fighting Monsters in Mighty form, Wolfgang will actually lose less Sanity than other Characters, due to the fights being shorter, resulting in less exposure to the insanity aura.
* A Tam o' Shanter provides 6.7 sanity/min, being a great Item to manage Wolfgang's Sanity. It not only stops Sanity drain at Night even for him, but it lasts very long and even provides insulation against the cold. Sleeping in a Tent or eating Taffy, Cooked Green Caps, Jerky or Pumpkin Cookies is also desirable when trying to get big amounts of Sanity back quickly.
* A Hibearnation Vest in RoG is also a good Sanity item with its 4.5 sanity/min. What little sanity is lost at night will be regained back during the day in no time. This will be useful when the player wants to equip something else other than the Tam in the head slot.
* In SW there are also different Crock Pot recipes that provide big amounts

# Poison

![Poison Settings Icon](Poison Settings Icon.png){:width="90px"}

- **Sanity Loss**: -6/min
- **Health Loss**: -0.1/sec to -0.8/sec
- **Effects**: 0.8x Hunger modifier

> "I don't feel so good." - Wilson

## Description
Poison is a new mechanic found in the Shipwrecked DLC. If a player Character is hit by a Mob or an environmental hazard that has a naturally poisonous attack, they will become poisoned. When a character is poisoned, they will slowly lose health and sanity. The poison will theoretically wear off after 3 game days, but multiple users have experienced it lasting 5-6 game days. The effects of poison can be cured by consuming an Anti Venom. Poison can also be cured by using a Venom Gland, however, the gland will deal up to 75 poison damage when used, but it will not kill the player character. If the player character has less than 80 health, the damage of the gland is reduced to leave 5 health after consumption. The effect of poisoning will progressively worsen over time. Initially, poison will deal 1 damage every 10 seconds for the duration of a day. Over the next 2 days, poison will deal increasing amounts of damage, and more frequently. As the damage increases, the poison effect in the UI will become more pronounced. The sanity is lost at a rate of 6 per minute and will not increase over time. While poisoned, player characters will gain a -0.2 hunger drain modifier, meaning characters with default hunger drain will get hungry 20% slower.

## Poison Effect Over Time
| Time since poisoning | Poison Damage | Damage interval |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| < 1 day             | 1             | 10 seconds    |
| < 1.75 days         | 1.5           | 10 seconds    |
| < 2.25 days         | 2             | 10 seconds    |
| < 2.7 days          | 2.5           | 9 seconds     |
| < 2.9 days          | 3             | 7 seconds     |
| >= 2.9 days         | 4             | 5 seconds     |

## Protection Against Poison
When fighting poisonous enemies, wearing a Seashell Suit or a Horned Helmet will prevent poisoning through physical contact, and wearing a Particulate Purifier will prevent poisoning through gas attacks. WX-78 is immune to poison, therefore they do not require additional protection.

## Poison's Effect on Mobs
Poison can also affect Mobs, which reduces their damage and movement speed by 25%, and increases their attack period by 25% (in other words, they attack 20% less frequently). Some Mobs are naturally immune to poison. It should be taken into account that upon a poisoned creature dying, all food items will instead be dropped at half freshness making them stale on drop. Poison lasts 120 seconds for Mobs, after which the poison will wear off.

## Hamlet DLC
The Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC also includes this mechanic. There are two new ways to get poisoned: Eating poisonous Food such as a Tuber and being attacked by a Scorpion with its sting. Besides, there are also three new ways to cure poison: Giving treasures to the Wishing Well, eating Magic Water, and using Poison Balm which is exclusive to Wormwood.

## Causes of Poison
| Mob              | Name               | Attack type | Required Protection | DLC       |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Poisonous Hole  | Poisonous Hole     | Gas         | Particulate Purifier or Gas Mask | Shipwrecked |
| Poison Mosquito | Poison Mosquito    | Physical    | Seashell Suit or Horned Helmet | Shipwrecked |
| Poison Snake     | Poison Snake       | Physical    | Seashell Suit or Horned Helmet | Shipwrecked |
| Spider Warrior  | Spider Warrior (Venomous) | Physical | Seashell Suit or Horned Helmet | Shipwrecked |
| Stink Ray       | Stink Ray          | Gas         | Particulate Purifier or Gas Mask | Shipwrecked |
| Yellow Crocodog | Yellow Crocodog    | Physical    | Seashell Suit or Horned Helmet | Shipwrecked |
| Scorpion        | Scorpion           | Physical    | Seashell Suit or Horned Helmet | Hamlet     |
| Poison Dartfrog Legs | Poison Dartfrog Legs, raw or cooked | Alimentary | None Available | Hamlet |

## Description

'''Mandrake Soup''' is a [[Vegetable]] [[Food]] [[item]] cooked in the [[Crock Pot]] by adding 1 Raw [[Mandrake#Food|Mandrake]]. It takes 60 seconds to cook.

Adding 2 Raw [[Drumstick]]s and 1 [[Meats|Meat]] may result in [[Turkey Dinner]] while adding 1 [[Eel]] and 1 [[Lichen]] will result in [[Unagi]]. Adding 2 or more [[Monster Food]]s may result in [[Monster Lasagna]].

Mandrake Soup does not put the player to [[sleep]] upon cooking or consumption, but spoils rather quickly, unlike the Cooked Mandrake, which never spoils. Making Cooked Mandrakes over Mandrake Soups may be preferred to make use of the sleep-inducing effect.

Most times, it is more efficient to make a [[Pan Flute]] out of a Mandrake rather than cooking it, but this depends on the player's preference.

- **Health**: 200
- **Damage**: 20
- **Attack Period**: 3
- **Walk Speed**: 4
- **Spawn From**: Egg of Terror
- **Spawn Code**: eyeofterror_mini

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: I'm starting to feel self-conscious.
- **Willow**: Ew ew ew!!
- **Wolfgang**: Feeling of being watched is bad, but feeling of being bitten is much worse!
- **Wendy**: I can feel the sting of their sharp gaze...

- **Woodie**: It's rude to stare, eh?
- **Maxwell**: We're going to be up to our eyeballs in... eyeballs.
- **Wigfrid**: I hath nö fear öf having all eyes upön me!
- **Webber**: We're not usually so bothered by a few extra eyes.
- **Winona**: Can't fault them for doing their job with the big overseer right there.
- **Warly**: I'm sure there are tastier things to eat than me!

- **Walter**: Would you say they're... multipl-eying? Heh. Good one, Walter.
- **Wanda**: My eyes aren't the best, but I'm not looking for replacements anytime soon!

## Behavior
Suspicious Peepers attack the nearest animal or monster they can find, similar to Hounds. Unlike Hounds, they do not attack Walls. When not engaged in fighting, Suspicious Peepers wander around aimlessly, eating any Meat items left on the ground and ignoring other food items like vegetables. If it is night time, they simply go to sleep when not doing anything else. When targeting a mob, they taunt for a short amount of time before attacking the mob. They rush forward and bite their target with their sharp teeth.

## Fighting
Suspicious Peepers can be kited by walking to the side. They can be stunlocked like Spiders. One can also bring other mobs near the Eggs from which the Suspicious Peepers hatch and they will attack due to their aggressive nature. However, the Eye of Terror's high damage charge attacks can easily kill the mobs used for distraction, thus making this strategy fail quickly.

## Egg of Terror
Egg of Terror is spawned by Eye of Terror. After some time, it will spawn a Suspicious Peeper.

## Trivia
- Suspicious Peepers are introduced in the "An Eye for An Eye" update as collaboration content with Re-Logic's [Terraria](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria).
- Suspicious Peepers are based on the Servant of Cthulhu in Terraria.
  - In Terraria, Servants of Cthulhu (Suspicious Peepers) are only spawned by Eye of Cthulhu (Eye of Terror) but not by The Twins (Twins of Terror).
- See Also: [Servant of Cthulhu (Terraria)](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Servant_of_Cthulhu)

# Moon Cycle

The **Moon Cycle** is a gameplay mechanic which affects the appearance of **Werepigs** and **Woodie's** transformation. Werepigs are normal **Pigs** who are caught outdoors during a full moon, and Woodie turns into a **Werebeaver** whenever there's a full moon.

During a full moon, **Chester** will transform into either a **Shadow Chester** if he has at least one **Nightmare Fuel** in every inventory slot or a **Snow Chester** if he has at least one **Blue Gem** in every slot.

The complete Moon Cycle lasts for 16 **Days** and then repeats (20 days in **Don't Starve Together**). Each phase of the Moon lasts for two **Nights**.

| Day(s) | Moon Phase | Image |
|--------|------------|-------|
| 1 - 2  | New Moon   | ![New Moon](Moon%20New.png) |
| 3 - 4  | Quarter (Waxing Crescent) Moon | ![Quarter Moon](Moon%20Quarter.png) |
| 5 - 6  | Half Moon   | ![Half Moon](Moon%20Half.png) |
| 7 - 8  | 3/4 (Waxing Gibbous) Moon | ![Three Quarters Moon](Moon%20Three%20Quarters.png) |
| 9 - 10 | Full Moon   | ![Full Moon](Moon%20Full.png) |
| 11 - 12| 3/4 (Waning Gibbous) Moon | ![Three Quarters Moon](Moon%20Three%20Quarters.png) |
| 13 - 14| Half Moon   | ![Half Moon](Moon%20Half.png) |
| 15 - 16| Quarter (Waning Crescent) Moon | ![Quarter Moon](Moon%20Quarter.png) |
| 17 - 18| New Moon (Next cycle) | ![New Moon](Moon%20New.png) |

The [Lunar Calendar Generator](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/files/file/473-dont-starve-lunar-calendar-in-javascript/) can be used to see past Day 18.

## Downloadable Content

In all **DLC**s, several additional changes can be observed on a full moon. The moon casts down a dim, blue-tinted light over the world, so the player can safely explore without a light source and fear of **Charlie**. **Mushrooms** will turn into **Mushtrees**. **Flowers** will turn into **Evil Flowers** (But will revert back from the 3/4 Gibbous days onwards). The eyes on **Pig Head**, **Wildbore Head**, and **Merm Head** Heads glow white, generate an insanity aura, and drop Nightmare Fuel when hammered. **Ghost**s will emerge from any type of **Grave**, including **Watery Graves**.

Full moons can also affect the Cave worlds. Unlike in the surface, the full moon does not provide light visibility to this world since caves are underground. Therefore, characters are required to have a sufficient light source while spelunking. Just like on the surface, the screen tone will change into a bluish color much like in **Winter**. Mushrooms also have a chance of turning into Mushtrees, Pigs will turn into Werepigs, and Flowers will change into Evil Flowers when in a cave.

In **RoG**, **Glommer's Statue** grows **Glommer's Flower**, which causes a **Glommer** to spawn nearby.

In **SW**, **Tides** in **Beach** biomes are much stronger during a full moon and absent during a new moon. During a full moon, **Wildbore**s turn into **Werepig**s, and **Waves** | Big Waves become much more common.

In **Hamlet** | HAM, during a full moon, **Piko**s and **Orange Piko**s will become hostile to the Player, as well as give off a small amount of light if kept in the Player's **Inventory**. Similar to Woodie, the full moon forces **Wilba** to transform into her Werepig form. During the **Aporkalypse**, the moon icon that shows the player the phase of the moon will be constant, showing a reddish moon, and the changes of a full moon will also be present.

## Don't Starve Together

In **Don't Starve Together**, a full moon only lasts one day. The first full moon occurs on day 11, and then it occurs every 20 days - on days 31, 51, 71, etc. Likewise, the first new moon occurs on day 1,

# Pig City (Hamlet)

> "Tis a village wörthy öf a shield maiden's prötectiön." - Wigfrid

Pig City is a [Biome] exclusive to the [Don't Starve: Hamlet]({{DLC}}). It includes [Pig Shops], [Pig Traders], [Watch Towers], [Town Houses], and [Royal Guards]. There are also [Set Pieces] featuring [Hedges] and [Intricate Topiaries].

In a Hamlet world, there are two Pig Cities:
- Swinesbury is found on the island that the player spawns on and contains the [Slanty Shanty].
- Palace City is found on an island that can be reached through a specific [Ancient Pig Ruins], and contains the other set of shops and the [Palace]. The Pig City may very occasionally spawn without houses and very few Watch Towers and [Lamp Posts].

[BFB] rarely enters this biome. During [Lush Season], [Bramble]s seem to avoid spawning in this biome. [Crows] and [Pigeons] are the only birds that spawn and land in this biome.

# Surface World

**Surface** is a default starting world where [Maxwell](#) (or [Charlie](#) in [Don't Starve Together](#)) cast a [Character](#) chosen by the player to struggle for survival in [Sandbox Mode](#). It's also the featured world in the five levels of [Adventure Mode](#), but with exceptional difficulty. In Sandbox Mode, it's the most hospitable and the least dangerous of the three worlds due to the abundance of food or other resources needed for basic survival.

## Features and Explorations

The Surface World has many [biomes](#), each with different features. [Trees](#) and [Saplings](#) are most common in the [Forest Biome](#), along with the occasional presence of [Pig Houses](#) or [Spider Dens](#). [Grass](#)es, [Rabbit Hole](#)s, and some [Boulders](#) can be found in [Savanna](#). [Grassland](#) is the most friendly of all the biomes because it contains all the resources needed for survival like [Log](#)s, Grass, [Twig](#)s, and [Flint](#). [Marsh](#), however, is the most dangerous because of the [Tentacles](#) that live there and the only biome where [Reeds](#), [Rundown Houses](#), [Spiky Tree](#)s, and [Spiky Bush](#)es can be found. [Rockyland](#) is composed entirely of bare rock spread across the entire area and some [Tallbirds](#) and their [Tallbird Nest](#)s.

There are also other features that can only be found in the Surface World like [Road](#)s, [Maxwell's Door](#), and the [Things](#) needed to assemble the [Wooden Thing](#) are randomly located in the Surface World.

## Weather and Seasons

The Surface World is the most atmospheric environment because it's influenced by weather and [seasons](#), phenomena which have different impacts on the world. [Rain](#) is a weather effect in which a character will take a [sanity](#) damage over time, and affects the growth rate of some [plants](#) in the world. [Lightning](#) will normally occur during heavy rain and can randomly set flammable objects [Fire](#) ablaze when struck. The [Day-Night Cycle](#) will affect the availability of most mobs or [mushrooms](#), and a character will take sanity damage during [dusk](#) or [night](#). Dynamic seasons will affect the appearance of the world, availability of resources, and mob behavior, availability, or appearance. During a [Full Moon](#), [Pigs](#) will transform into Werepigs.

# Pirate Raids

![Pirate Raid Loading Screen](Pirate Raid Loading Screen.png "Pirate Raid Loading Screen"){: .thumb width=350px} 

Here are some quotes from the characters in **Don't Starve Together**:
- **Wilson**: That shanty can only mean one thing...
- **Willow**: Uh, that sound's getting closer...
- **Wolfgang**: Someone is music making?
- **Wendy**: Nowhere to run... they're here.
- **WX-78**: MUSICAL REVELRY DETECTED. ANNOYANCE INCOMING
- **Wickerbottom**: Oh dear, it's those troublemakers playing their loud music again...
- **Woodie**: Hang on Lucy, it sounds like we've got company.
- **Maxwell**: I don't like the sound of that...
- **Wigfrid**: A ship approaches! Prepare for battle!
- **Webber**: Uh oh... we're not sure we like the sound of that.
- **Warly**: Oh, zut alors...
- **Wormwood**: Hmm? Funny sounds coming...
- **Winona**: Sounds like someone's about to throw a monkey wrench in the works...
- **Wortox**: Something scurvy this way comes.
- **Wurt**: Sound like somebody having fun over there! Wanna see!
- **Walter**: What's that music? Did someone bring a radio?
- **Wanda**: Botheration! I can hear their catchy music getting closer!

## Description
Pirate Raids are events exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the **The Curse of Moon Quay** update. They occur periodically when a player is on a **Boat** within 800 tiles from the **Queen of Moon Quay**.

## Frequency
Pirate Raids increase in frequency based on how long each player has survived on average. With any amount of players on the server, within 300 tiles of Queen of Moon Quay and an average survival time of 81+ days the pirate raid has 20% chance to spawn every 360 seconds, the maximum spawn frequency.

## Raid Details
The raid involves a **Pirate Sloop**, maneuvered by 2 to 5 **Powder Monkeys** and a **Prime Mate**, quickly approaching the player's boat. All **Powder Monkeys** that are part of the raid are equipped with a **Pirate's Bandana** and a **Cutlass**. The number of Powder Monkeys increases with the average day count of each player on the server, with the maximum number of 5 Powder Monkeys capped at 61 days.

Once close enough, the monkeys will jump onto the targeted ship to steal any items on the floor or from the player, destroy any **Masts**, and afterwards return to their boat and leave. If the Pirate Sloop is destroyed in any way, such as having **leaks** slowly chip away its health, all of the pirates on the boat will evacuate by jumping into the water, giving their usual drops besides **Meat**, **Morsel**, and **Tree Jam**.

The raiders will not attack the player during the raid unless attacked themselves, and the Prime Mate if a player boards the Pirate Sloop that they appeared on. If any of the Powder Monkeys find a **Banana** as part of the raid, they will take it and immediately leave.

Fighting the monkeys can be dangerous, as an unprepared player can be easily overwhelmed by all the monkeys attacking. However, defeating the **Prime Mate** is the only way to obtain the **Pirate Map**, an item which reveals the **Pirate Stash**, which in turn holds any items lost through Powder Monkeys as well as the possibility of the **Blueprints** for **Polly Roger's Hat** and the **Moon Quay Pirate Banner**. Defeating the Prime Mate is also the only way to obtain the **Captain's Tricorn** and the **Battle Paddle**, the former of which is required to craft the aforementioned Polly Roger's Hat.

If the player is able to successfully hit an incoming Pirate Sloop with a **Cannon**, the raiders will flee.

## Alternate Pirate Raid
Alternatively, a Pirate Raid may instead feature the Powder Monkeys and Prime Mate carry away a **Sunken Chest** with its usual loot, and a **Cannon** accompanying the pirates. In this case, instead of moving toward the players' boat they simply move past it in a single direction until provoked.

## Turf Info

- **Image**: Grass_Turf_Texture.png
- **Name**: Grass Turf
- **Pitchfork**: 1
- **Planted**: 1

## Properties

- **Burnable**: Yes, it can be burned.
- **Dropped By**: Grasslands tiles (Pitchfork)
- **Stack**: 10
- **Burn Time**: 45 seconds
- **Spawn Code**: "turf_grass"

## Uses

Plants like Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Lureplants, Pine Cones, and Birchnuts can be planted on these Turfs. It will not stop the Lureplants' Eyeplants from spawning.

When placed on the Surface World and the area is large enough, only Redbirds will spawn and land on these Turfs. During Winter, Redbirds are replaced by Snowbirds.

## Downloadable Content

In the Shipwrecked DLC, Grass Turf behaves like Jungle Turf: Parrots and Parrot Pirates are the only birds that spawn. During Hurricane Season, there are no birds that spawn and land on these turfs. Floods can spawn on this turf.

# Farming

Farming is the process of growing **Food** or other **renewable resources** to aid in survival. In general, it requires a permanent base camp where the crops can be planted and grown. There are several types of farming including Farms, transplanted items such as **Berry Bushes**, and Ranching.

## Farms {{DS|32}}

Farms are made by creating **Basic Farms** or **Improved Farms**, which are fertile patches of ground where **Vegetables** can be grown. Once built, **Seeds** can be planted in them which will grow into random vegetables, or **Crop Seeds** for specific crops. Some Vegetables grown from regular Seeds appear more frequently than others (see table, below).

Farms can be used to grow 20 (basic) or 30 (improved) vegetables before they lose fertility and require additional fertilizing. Crops will only grow if they have light and when the **Winterometer|temperature** is above 5 degrees; growth stops any other time. When temperature is above 28 degrees crops grow 100% faster; when it's **Rain**ing crops grow up to 300% (depending on **precipitation rate**, which will vary over the course of the rain) faster. This means that when it is hot and raining heavily, crops grow up to 400% faster.

It is possible to use any kind of light to allow crop growth: **Campfire**, **Lantern**, **Torch**, **Fireflies** or even **Pig House**.

### Types of Farms

|  Farm Type  |    Materials Required    |    Growth Time    | Uses Before Re-fertilizing |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Basic Farm | 8 **Grass**, 4 **Manure**, 4 **Logs** | **4 days** of light | **20** |
| Improved Farm | 10 **Grass**, 6 **Manure**, 4 **Stone** | **2 days** of light | **30** |

Specific vegetables can be grown in Farms by using Crop Seeds. These seeds are produced by feeding a **Bird** imprisoned in a **Birdcage** any vegetable or fruit; except for **Mandrake**s or **Berries**. The Bird will drop 1 or 2 Crop Seeds of the selected type, plus an occasional regular Seed (total of 3 possible seeds). Once planted, Crop Seeds will grow into their corresponding crop.

### Fertilizers {{DS|32}}

Items such as **Guano**, **Manure**, **Rot**, and **Rotten Egg**s can be used as fertilizers. When placed on the sprout in a Farm, fertilizers will advance its growth. The amount of fertilizer needed to fully grow a newly planted crop depends on the type of Farm and the type of fertilizer.

**Guano** substitutes 1.5 days, **Manure** and each **Bucket-o-poop** use substitutes 1 day, and **Rot**/**Rotten Egg** substitutes 0.25 days. Thus, **Basic Farms** need 3 Guano, 4 Manure or 16 Rot/Rotten Eggs, and **Improved Farms** need only 2 Guano, 2 Manure or 8 Rot/Rotten Eggs to fully grow a newly planted crop. Fertilizers do not advance crop growth when it's below 0 **Winterometer|degrees** in **Winter**, and using a fire to warm the area will not change this.

Fertilizers are also needed when a Farm loses fertility, which happens after 20 or 30 uses depending on the type of Farm. When a Farm is depleted, it will turn a lighter shade of brown and cannot be used for growing anything until fertilizer is added. Guano will rejuvenate a Farm for 12 additional uses, Manure for 10 and Rot/Rotten Eggs will only provide 2.

Fertilizers are also needed for transplanted plants. **Berry Bush**es and **Grass Tuft**s that are dug up with a shovel and replanted must be fertilized before they will start to grow again. After a Berry Bush has been harvested 3-5 times or a Grass Tuft 20 times, they will require additional fertilizer. Naturally grown Bushes, Grass, and Saplings never need to be fertilized.

## Transplanting

**Berry Bushes**, **Grass Tufts**, **Saplings**, and **Spiky Bush**es can all be dug up with a **Shovel** and replanted anywhere. Typically, this is done to move them closer to a base camp for easy harvesting. Tufts and Bushes will need to be fertilized after being planted. Replanted Saplings and Spiky Bushes

### Tips
- Bacon and Eggs replenish as much hunger as Meatballs while healing the same amount as Honey Nuggets. For this reason, it is a good food option when one returns to base after losing health, and requires both nutrition and healing.
- Bacon and Eggs are an effective recipe if one's base has a Birdcage, as it is a good way to spend an excess supply of Monster Meat: two Monster Meats can be fed to the Bird for Eggs, while the remaining 0.5 meat requirement can be made up with Morsels, which can fulfil the recipe with three uses of Monster Meats (one as itself, two turned into eggs).
- Bacon and Eggs have an exceptional spoilage time of 20 days, which makes them a good alternative for Jerky while making long expeditions, or if one needs to increase the longevity of their meat stock

- **Wilba**: MUCH ADO ABOUT GNAT-ING
- **Wormwood**: Stay away, Bzzters!
- **Wheeler**: Normally I like being around flyers, but I'll make an exception.
- **Choose**: Wendy

## Behavior
The Gnat Swarm spawns from Gnat Mounds in the Painted Biome. It takes the form of a swarm of bugs that will chase and attach itself to the player character's head. While attached, it will decrease the player's 12 5 Sanity per minute and deal 1 hp damage every 10 seconds, starting 30 seconds after being attached. It will follow the player until it finds a non-Fire light source to attach to, either at Dusk or Night (such as Thunderbirds, Town Houses, or Glowflies).

The swarm isn't a status effect, but is an actual entity that is flying around the player. When force attacking, the swarm can only be hit if there are no other targets around. Attacking them directly will neither deal any damage, nor decrease durability of the weapon, possibly because they are not a single entity but a swarm and therefore can dodge attacks quickly.

However, they can be killed by other means:
- Spraying a cloud of Bug B'Gone
- Freezing them with an Ice Staff (this action does not decrease durability of the Staff but still drains sanity as usual) or Chilled Amulet, and then attacking them normally
- Leading them into the Gas Rainforest biome

If a Gnat Mound is destroyed, the swarm which comes from it will spawn a new mound after some time, similar to Moleworms.

The swarm still attaches to the player even when your character dies and resurrects with the power of a Meat Effigy, Touch Stone or a Life Giving Amulet. It's possible to carry a Gnat Swarm to connected worlds by using the Seaworthy or Skyworthy.

## Tips
- Overcharged WX-78 players should be cautious, as they shine brighter than the other light sources, and therefore the Gnat Swarm will never leave them on its own.
- When playing as Wendy, Abigail will instantly attack Gnat Swarms and won't stop doing so, unless the player goes into a Cave Cleft in which Abigail is going to follow the player. After that, she follows the player as normal. Abigail is not able to kill the Gnat Swarm, however. At night, the swarm may attach itself to Abigail as she is a bright, non-fire light source.
- Strangely, using a Telelocator Staff and a stocked Telelocator Focus on a attaching swarm result in completely destroying it (whether a mob or a player being attached), while using on a wandering swarm result in teleport it to the Telelocator Focus. Making this an expensive way to kill Gnat Swarm.
- Iron Ore can be renewable outside of a Hamlet world by carrying a Gnat Swarm then using an Ice Staff to freeze it when a desired location is reached.
- Maxwell does not have the sanity loss from Gnat Swarm as a result of his dapperness.
- Gnat swarms also detach as soon as a new day starts, allowing a brief

}}

## Unlocking
WX-78 is unlocked after accumulating 960 XP (total of 120 days survived).

## Robot Anatomy
WX-78 suffers no penalties from eating stale and spoiled food, though they are still vulnerable to foods such as [[Monster Meat]] that apply stat penalties even when fresh. Additionally, they are capable of eating [[Gears]]. Gears are a potent food, restoring 50 {{hp}}, 75 {{hunger}}, and 60 {{sanity}}, in addition to permanently increasing WX's maximum values for each stat by 20 {{hp}}, 7 {{hunger}}, and 14 {{sanity}} each. WX's stats cap at 400 {{hp}}, 200 {{hunger}}, and 300 {{sanity}}, after consuming a total of 15 Gears.

In ''[[Shipwrecked]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]'' worlds, WX-78 is also immune to [[Poison]], though they still take damage while in the [[Gas Rainforest]]. Eating a [[Venom Gland]] as WX will cure poison without inflicting damage.

## System Overload
[[File:WX lightning dusk.png|thumb|right|230px|WX-78 glowing during the evening after being struck by lightning.]]

When struck by [[Lightning]], WX-78 regains 100 {{hp}} and enters System Overload, granting the following perks in exchange for -33 {{sanity}}:

* Base movement speed is increased to 150%.
* WX emits light around them, the radius gradually diminishing as the Overload nears its end.
* WX is immune to [[Freezing]].

Note that when using a [[Telelocator Staff]], WX suffers the combined {{sanity}} penalties of both lightning strikes, in addition to the penalty from using the Staff in the first place, but gains no {{hp}}.

System Overload lasts for 6 minutes, although the duration and initial effects stack if WX is struck multiple times, potentially lasting several days. WX is capable of igniting nearby flammable objects should he be struck by lightning, although a [[Lightning Rod]] or equippables that protect from lightning will stop him from being struck.

## Disadvantages
* WX's initial stats are significantly lower than average, rendering them exposed to danger until they can begin upgrading.
* WX is not waterproof. In vanilla worlds, they take -0.5 {{hp}} every 3-5 seconds while it is raining. In ''[[Reign of Giants]]'', ''Shipwrecked'', and ''Hamlet'', the damage they take is tied to their [[Wetness]]; with 1 Wetness or more, WX suffers the {{hp}} drain described above, while their Wetness resistance will reduce this damage accordingly (e.g. a [[Pretty Parasol]] grants 50% Wetness resistance, so WX will only take -0.25 {{hp}} every 3-5 seconds. While taking rain damage, WX will periodically emit light from the sparks flying off their body, which is bright and frequent enough to ward off [[Charlie]] at the cost of the heavy negative {{sanity}} penalty from being in pitch black.

# Abyss

The **Abyss** acts as a barrier, much like the **Ocean**, but it separates areas rather than biomes. No living thing can cross the Abyss, including flying mobs like **Batilisks**.

## Presence
It is only present in:
- **[Caves](Caves)**
- **[Ruins](Ruins)** in **[Sandbox Mode](Sandbox Mode)**
- **[Chapter 6](Adventure Mode#Darkness)** of **[Adventure Mode](Adventure Mode)**

## Effects on Objects
Objects situated close to the Abyss may drop their items into this endless pit, and aside from glitched objects, they will fall into the depths and become irretrievable.

## Mob Spawning
Unlike its surface counterpart, the **Ocean**, which can spawn **Pengulls**, the Abyss currently doesn't spawn any mobs.

# Don’t Starve Together
In **Don't Starve Together**, players can build **[Spelunker's Bridge](Spelunker's Bridge)** to cross gaps no more than 6 tiles. If the Spelunker's Bridge breaks, anything on it will fall into the Abyss. Items and structures on the bridge cannot be retrieved, but players will be sent back to the nearest land with all of their items intact.

# Trivia
- In the early versions of the Caves, terrain was limited by walls instead of the Abyss.
- Items that drop in the Abyss will make a splash animation as if it were made of water.
- Naturally spawning entities such as mushrooms can sometimes spawn in the Abyss.
- There have been instances of **[Flotsam](Flotsam)** spawning in the Abyss of the caves.
- It is possible to hover over the Abyss by approaching the edge at high speeds (40+). However, the speed required to achieve this cannot be legitimately obtained.

The Ancient Guardian is a Boss Monster found within the Labyrinth region of the Ruins. It looks and acts similarly to a Clockwork Rook, but appears as a living creature covered in fur.

The Ancient Guardian has 2500 Health and will respawn when the caves are reset via the Seed of Ruin, making Guardian's Horns renewable.

## Fight Mechanics

Ancient Guardian's fight functions differently from the base game. It will charge towards the player but will be stunned for 1.5-6 seconds if it hits one of the pillars, allowing the player to attack; the longer time that Ancient Guardian charged, the longer the Ancient Guardian will be stunned when it hits an obstacle. When the Ancient Guardian charges into a pillar, it will cause a small earthquake. The earthquake drops 20 minerals like Flint, Rocks, and Nitre over 2.5 seconds within 5 tiles of the Ancient Guardian, as well as dropping up to 4 Pillar Fragments within 6.25 tiles. The Pillar Fragments can stun the Ancient Guardian if it charges into them, akin to entire pillars.

Once its health goes below 1,500, it will enter its second phase. It gains a new attack where it jumps and slams the ground into the player's position, similar to the Hippopotamoose from the Hamlet DLC. If the player manages to dodge the slam, the Ancient Guardian will be stunned for 3.6 seconds, but if the player fails the dodge, it will continue to attack as normal. During this phase, it has 1-5% of bleeding when attacked, which then spawn up to 5 Shadow Tentacles within 1 tile. The Ancient Guardian has a higher chance of bleeding shadow tentacle when it has lower health. The shadow tentacles deal 60 damage per hit, and they despawn after 30 seconds. The shadow tentacles are invulnerable.

Ancient Guardian has an aggro range of 6.25 tiles.

## Description
Ocean Debris are naturally spawning objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**.

Ocean Debris appear in the **Ocean** and they can be retrieved with a **Sea Fishing Rod** or a **Pinchin' Winch**. The player can examine an Ocean Debris to drop two random items. The table below lists the possible items.

Every 30 to 180 seconds, a Flotsam can appear close to the player in the Ocean. Flotsam can either be a **Driftwood Piece**, a **Boat Fragment**, a **Cut Grass**, a **Twigs**, or an Ocean Debris (almost 20% each). They drown after 3 to 4 days if not picked.

## Description

_Waves_ are a new game mechanic introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. Waves appear in **Ocean** biomes at all times of the year, however, their frequency and size varies with **Seasons** and the **Moon Cycle**.

All naturally occurring Waves travel in the same direction, which changes at **Night** every day. Waves will only originate in medium and deep Ocean, and will disperse shortly if they enter the shallow Ocean.

### Common Waves
Common Waves are short, and move slowly. Common Waves are found during all seasons, however they become less frequent during **Hurricane Season**, and much less frequent during **Dry Season**. The full moon causes a number of Common Waves to be replaced with Big Waves.

Sailing any **Boat** into a Common Wave while heading in the same direction as the Wave will provide a small speed boost, with a four times increased boost if the boat is an **Encrusted Boat**, or a five times increased boost if it is Walani's **Surfboard**.

Sailing into Common Waves while going in any other direction will cause the player to gain 15 **Wetness**, increased to 22.5 for Walani's Surfboard, and damage the Boat for 5 Health.

### Big Waves
Big Waves appear as tall walls of water, which travel three times faster than Common Waves. Big Waves will naturally occur in small numbers starting on the Day of the full moon, becoming more frequent as Night falls. Naturally occurring Big Waves also become very frequent during Hurricane Season, eventually replacing Common Waves entirely as the season goes on.

In addition to spawning naturally, Big Waves can be created by Boat Cannon shots, exploding Gunpowder Barrels, Whales, Quacken Tentacles, Tiger Shark, Sealnado, and Dragoon Eggs falling into the Ocean, even if any of these happen in shallow Ocean. A Common Wave can become a Big Wave when crossing into deeper water. Big Waves take longer to disperse when entering shallow Ocean.

Sailing any boat into a Big Wave will cause 25 Wetness and 15 damage to the Boat, regardless of the direction. However, Walani can ride Big Waves with her Surfboard if she's going in the same direction as the Wave, though she will also receive 37.5 Wetness and 15 damage to her Surfboard for hitting a Big Wave incorrectly.

## Hamlet
Both Common Waves and Big Waves are also included in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. They can only be created by a Hippopotamoose. Hippopotamoose will create a large number of Common Waves as they move through the water, and can cause a splash of Big Waves if they use their stomp attack in the water.

## Don't Starve Together
_Waves look different in **Don't Starve Together**. They can only be created by Malbatross, Gnarwail, Gnarwail Horn, and Grass Gator._

_Waves push away items on the water. When a player is hit by a wave, it applies 9 Wetness to player._

## Tips
- The Wetness gained by crashing into both types of Waves can

# Bridges

![Bridge between landmasses](Bridge between landmasses.png "Bridge between landmasses")

## Description
Bridges are rare tiles that spawn over the ocean, forming long narrow strips of land that connect larger landmasses. The turfs underneath cannot be moved with a Pitchfork.

In older versions of the worlds in Don't Starve, bridges connected rounded islands. They are less common in the newer versions when the rougher map generation was introduced, though they can still be found in Caves and in certain levels of Adventure Mode.

Bridges in new versions usually appear whenever a Road or Trail has generated itself near the ocean.

## Prototype Tips
In Don't Starve Together, Boats can be used as craftable bridges to connect landmasses if the boats are kept in place, usually with an Anchor. Docks can also be used, as long as the landmasses are in Coastal waters.

## Scrapbook Info

Emits powerful spider-healing flatulence when threatened.

## Description

The Nurse Spider is a mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together. It is spawned by the Spider Queen when she's been attacked, or from feeding most other spiders a Nurse Switcherdoodle. Nurse Spiders have the exclusive ability to periodically heal non-hostile spiders by 150 health in an area-of-effect (AoE) around it in a 8 unit radius, indicated by a web visual effect, with a cooldown of 8 seconds. If loyal to any players playing Webber, they will be healed for 8hp. Nurse Spiders will not use their healing ability unless in combat, regardless of the health of nearby spiders or the player if playing as Webber.

Webber also can pick up spider to inventory.

## Usage & Farming

- **Recipe:** Result: Nurse Spider, Item 2: Nurse Switcherdoodle, Item 1: Spiders, Tool: Hand

## Shadow Rift Content

If it gets caught in the Acid Rain, its damage attack will rise to +50%, move speed will rise to +15%, and taking damage decreases by -25%. The fact that it is subject to the effect can be understood by the special breath that he will emit.

## Trivia

- If playing as Webber, keep a Fleshy Bulb for Nurse Spider's target to easily get healed. It can save your life even if you are too cold/too hot/starving/being attacked by Charlie.
- According to Rhymes With Play #281, the Nurse Spider is based on an old spider concept by Nabieah. It was previously described as a "cannon fodder spider". This concept existed for at least two years before being released in the game.
- The Nurse Spider was added in the Webber character update.

The shadow queen Charlie has begun to make her mark on the Don't Starve world, and her influence is manifesting in new and mysterious ways. What is her plan for Wilson and the survivors? Will she aid them in their fight for survival, or does she have something more dastardly in store?

### A New Reign: Part 2

Charlie the shadow queen has been plotting dark new challenges for Wilson and his fellow survivors from her umbral throneroom, and she’s ready to unleash her latest creations on the world of Don’t Starve Together!

### Final

The reign of the new shadow queen has swept across the land of Don't Starve Together and now creeps deep into the bowels of the earth. What ancient secrets will be dredged up by Charlie's dark machinations, and what purpose does she have in mind for the formidable being at the center of the Ruins?
