# Tesla Biome

Initially, the **Reign of Giants** DLC was supposed to feature a Tesla Biome, but the idea was abandoned. It has purported concept art.[^1]

## Includes:

- **[Tesla Tree](#Unimplemented_Structures#Tesla Tree)**

![Tesla Tree Concept Art](Don't Starve Concept Art 2.jpg "Possibly based on this concept art")
![Tesla Tree](Tesla tree.png)

[^1]: [Tesla Tree Discussion](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/32242-tesla-tree/?do=findComment&comment=423973)

# Grotto Biome

In the files of **Don't Starve: Newhome**, many files were found created in the style of Klei and at the same time with the prefix grotto, but not part of **Don't Starve** or **Don't Starve Together**. Judging by the modern style, they may have been originally designed for the "Return of Them" updates. Apparently it was supposed to be a cave biome.{{verify}}

## Includes:

- **[Grotto Splash](#Unimplemented_SFXs#Grotto Splash)**
- **[Grotto Mowlth](#Unimplemented_Creatures#Grotto Mowlth)**
- **[Grotto Grub](#Unimplemented_Creatures#Grotto Grub)**

# Lava Cave

Initially, instead of ruins, there were supposed to be **Lava Caves**. In them, you could get a lot of useful staves and lava rivers (which functionally worked like roads on the map). Willow's fire immunity would have been extremely useful for lava caves.{{verify}}

## Included:

- **[Rock Light](#Unimplemented_Structures#Rock Light)** (Unconfirmed)
- **[Lava Pit](#Unimplemented_Mechanics_and_Animations#Rock Light)** (Unconfirmed)
- Lava River

**Broken Bits and Pieces** are objects found in the **Ruins**. They can be spawned into the game using the spawn code `"rubble"`. When mined, they drop **Rocks** and **Cut Stone**, with a small chance of dropping additional **Gravedigger Items**, **Frazzled Wires**, **Gears**, **Gems**, **Nightmare Fuel**, or **Thulecite**.

# Friend-o-matic
> "If I had any friends, this could take me to them." - Wilson
> "If I step through, will I still be me?" - Wilson
> "It seems to be popular over there." - Wilson

The **Friend-o-matic** is a structure exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** that can be spawned via console and has artwork in the files. Its spawn code is `"migration_portal"`. It functions like a Cave Entrance and allows players to move between servers shard.

# DST Iceberg
In **Don't Starve Together** characters have quotes for an **Iceberg** and **Melted Iceberg**. According to the quotes, these could be icebergs in the **Ocean** that act as obstacles for boats.

# Lava Pit
> "Good thing it's contained!" - Wilson

A **Lava Pit** is a naturally spawning object in the **Caves** looking identical to **Nightmare Light**s, except for being colorless. It used to be accessible using the spawn code `"lavapit"`, but has since been removed from the game. When destroyed with a **Hammer**, the Lava Pit would emit light and start to slowly rebuild itself. Once it had rebuilt itself completely, it would no longer act as a light source.

# Maxwell's Mosquito Trap
> "Is ball full of angry bitebugs." - Wolfgang
> "Bottled mosquito rage!" - Wilson
> "Mosquitoes inside. They don't sound happy." - Willow
> "Maybe I shouldn't have put that there." - Maxwell

**Maxwell's Mosquito Trap** is an unimplemented item that acts in the same way as the **Bee Mine**, but spawns **Mosquito**es instead of **Bee**s and cannot be picked up. It is activated when the player or another mob steps on it, causing the spawned Mosquitoes to attack them. Like **Maxwell's Tooth Trap**, it was meant to only emerge in **Adventure Mode**. Its spawn code is `"beemine_maxwell"`.

- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine

### Tips
Since Snakes are hostile to most mobs, Snake Skin can be farmed easily by placing other mobs near snake-infested Viney Bushes. However, The mobs need to be active at dusk and night, since Snakes are only active during those times. Prime Apes and **Spiders** work well for this purpose. Prime Apes will collect the drops (except with **Wilbur**), which means the player will need to kill or befriend them to obtain the Snake Skin.

Third, that the object is located on the territory of the **Palace**. Fourth, that the object was created by the player. The fourth flag can also be found on the Watch Tower next to the **Lever Thing**. Flags appear on **Watch Tower**, **Palace Watch Tower** and **City Hall**.

## Trivia

- The Palace Watch Tower will always have the Queen Flag, however if you spawn it with a command it will have the player's flag.
- All flags have unrealized burnt models.
- There are [unused flags](#) that also have burnt models, but do not have a flagpole.
- There is a model of an [unused shadow flag](#).

## Description
Monster Tartare is a Warly-specific Food Item cooked in the Portable Crock Pot by adding 2 Monster Foods. It takes 10 seconds to cook. Similar to Monster Lasagna, Monster Tartare damages the player's Health and Sanity when eaten (-20 HP and -20 Sanity), but it restores more Hunger (+62.5 Hunger). These negative effects do not apply to Webber. Monster Tartare can also be fed to Woby to instantly transform her into big Woby.

## Recipe
### Cookbook Recipe
- **Item 1**: Monster Foods
- **Count 1**: 2.0
- **Comparator 1**: x
- **Item 2**: Filler
- **Count 2**: 2
- **Tool**: Portable Crock Pot
- **Result**: Monster Tartare
- **Note**: Filler cannot be Inedibles.

### Examples
- **Recipe 1**:
  - **Item 1**: Monster Meat
  - **Count 1**: 2
  - **Item 2**: Ice
  - **Count 2**: 2
  - **Tool**: Portable Crock Pot
  - **Result**: Monster Tartare

- **Recipe 2**:
  - **Item 1**: Monster Meat
  - **Item 2**: Monster Meat
  - **Item 3**: Monster Meat
  - **Item 4**: Monster Meat
  - **Tool**: Portable Crock Pot
  - **Result**: Monster Tartare

## Tips
- This dish effectively replaces Monster Lasagna if Warly uses his Portable Crock Pot.
- It is best to avoid this dish, due to the huge loss of both Health and Sanity, except for Webber, who may see some benefit to this.
- Swapping one Monster Food to any other Filler will most likely produce Meatballs instead, which restores the same amount of hunger without the Health and Sanity loss. Furthermore, Meatballs becomes more efficient at restoring hunger than Monster Tartare if the replacing filler has a hunger value less than monster meat.

## Trivia
- Monster Tartare was introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Warly Character Update.
- Steak Tartare is raw or lightly seared minced meat served with raw onions and a raw egg yolk.

# WX-78 Character Information

![WX-78 Portrait](WX-78_Original_Portrait.png)

- **Health**: 125
- **Hunger**: 125
- **Sanity**: 150
- **Health Multiplier**: -3 to -9 when wet
- **Hunger Multiplier**: -1× to -0.512×
- **Speed**: 1× to 1.5×

**Starting Items:**
- Bio Scanalyzer
- Circuit Extractor

**Favorite Food:** Butter Muffin

**Spawn Code:** "wx78"

**Filter:** ![WX-78 Filter](WX-78_Filter.png) WX-78

## Abilities and Features

WX-78 is able to eat stale and spoiled food without the related penalties, though is not immune to all food penalties (such as eating Monster Meat). This allows them to stockpile food for increased lengths of time.

WX-78 may consume Gears to recover 75 hunger, 60 sanity, and 50 health per item. Upon death, they will drop anywhere from 33-50% of the gears they've ingested during their life (rounded down), up to a cap of 40.

WX-78 has half the aggro range from Clockworks and Damaged Clockworks. For instance, the Clockwork Rook's normal range of 12 meters will be reduced to 6 meters towards WX-78.

Additionally, being struck by lightning will drain 33 sanity and restore 100 health.

## Charge Meter

![Charge Meter](Wx-78CircuitsDemonstration.png)

WX-78's main perk takes the form of their charge meter situated on the right of the UI. It slowly refills with charge over time. The meter has 6 bars where circuits can be plugged into, taking anywhere from 1 to all 6 of the bars depending on the circuit. Once the circuit's bars are filled, the circuit will apply its effects. Note: multiple circuits of the same type will stack their effects unless stated otherwise.

When a Circuit is applied to the charge meter, it will attempt to take up the lowest unoccupied pins available. Removing a Circuit via Circuit Extractor will remove the highest, and thereby latest Circuit applied.

Every 90 seconds, WX-78 will gain one unit of charge as long as they are not Starving or Wet. WX-78 can receive one unit of Charge by using a Lightning Rod that has been recently struck, being struck by lightning, or eating Electric Milk or Volt Goat Chaud-Froid. They can also be fueled by Winona's Generators and Winona's G.E.M.erators, which will use 90% of the generator's maximum charge and 6% of the G.E.M.erator's maximum charge.

If WX-78 becomes Frozen, two units of charge will be lost. Charge units will also be lost when using the Circuit Extractor to remove circuits, with the amount being equal to the amount of charge the Circuit was actively using.

## Circuit Extractor

![Circuit Extractor](Circuit_Extractor.png) [[Circuit Extractor]] - Extracts the top circuit in WX-78's system and removes an amount of charge equivalent with how many slots it took up.

## Bio Scanalyzer

![Bio Scanalyzer](Bio_Scanalyzer.png) [[Bio Scanalyzer]] - Allows WX-78 to scan living creatures to acquire blueprints for the below circuits

| Icon | Circuit Name | Effect | Slots | Unlocked by scanning | Crafting ingredients |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Hardy Circuit](Hardy_Circuit.png) | [[Hardy Circuit]] | +50 health maximum health | 1 | Spider | Bio Data x2, Spider Gland x1 |
| ![Super-Hardy Circuit](Super-Hardy_Circuit.png) | [[Super-Hardy Circuit]] | +150 health maximum health | 2 | Nurse Spider | Bio Data x4, Spider Gland x2, Hardy Circuit x1 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Disadvantages

- Without any circuits, WX-78 has stats on the lower end of the spectrum and may succumb to insanity or starvation quicker than other characters.
- WX-78 takes damage from Rain at a rate of 3-9 damage health based on their wetness and a charge slot every 5 seconds when above 15 wetness, which can pose a significant threat. Great care should be taken to avoid wetness.
- Rain damage causes WX-78 to periodically emit Light as sparks fly off their body. The light emitted is frequent and bright enough to prevent Charlie from attacking, but comes at the cost of large amounts of

# Clothes in Don't Starve Together

This article is about the gameplay affecting items. For the cosmetic clothes in Don't Starve Together, see [Skins](#).

Clothes are any in-game [Items] that can be worn and provide the [Character] a variety of bonuses. Unlike [Armor], Clothes do not mitigate damage from attacks and usually their [Durability] is decreased over time as long as they're equipped. Bonuses from different Clothes that can be equipped at the same time will stack with each other.

All the Clothes, except for those that need specific fuel or spoil over time, can be repaired with a [Sewing Kit], which will add 5 more days of usage, until fully repaired.

Please note that I've kept the format of the table, but in Markdown, tables are typically defined using pipes (`|`) to separate columns and hyphens (`-`) to define the header row. I've also replaced the internal links with simple text references, as Markdown doesn't support the same linking syntax as Wiki.

# How to Survive in Don't Starve and Make it Easily Through Winter

## Initial Setup
1. **Finding Beefalo**: Wander around until you find a herd of Beefalo, typically found on a savanna bordering grasslands. Camp near them but out of sight to avoid aggression.
2. **Camp Setup**: Set up a camp with a fire pit, science machine, alchemy engine, and chest. Avoid water to reduce pengull presence.
3. **Wolves and Beefalo**: Lead wolves to the Beefalo herds to have them kill each other.

## Gathering Resources
1. **Rabbit Traps**: Set traps on savanna for rabbits, preferably near your camp, to get 2-6 rabbits daily.
2. **Manure Collection**: Collect about 20 manure for fertilizing berry bushes.
3. **Berry Bushes**: Prototype a shovel and plant berry bushes at your camp, fertilizing them with manure.

## Protecting Crops
1. **Lightning Rod**: Place a lightning rod near your camp to protect berry bushes from lightning strikes.

## Willow's Sanity Management
- Be cautious when playing as Willow and your sanity is low to avoid setting berry bushes on fire.

## Farming and Charcoal
1. **Improved Farms**: Set up 4-5 improved farms for regular food production.
2. **Charcoal Production**: Burn isolated trees far from camp to produce charcoal for fuel and drying racks.

## Treeguards and Pinecones
- If a treeguard spawns, pacify it by planting pinecones near it. This will prevent it from attacking and can provide protection.

## Dried Meat (Jerky)
1. **Drying Racks**: Craft 5-10 drying racks and place morsels of rabbit meat on them to produce jerky every 2-3 days.
2. **Ice Box**: Craft an ice box to extend the longevity of jerky and farm produce.

## Winter Preparation
1. **Emergency Food**: Stop harvesting jerky before winter to preserve it as an emergency food source.
2. **Rabbit Earmuffs**: Craft rabbit earmuffs for warmth, or other warming clothes.
3. **Thermal Stone**: Craft a thermal stone for additional warmth.
4. **Resources**: Stock up on manure, charcoal, cut grass, and wood next to your fire pit.
5. **Saplings**: Dig up saplings for post-winter recovery.

## Post-Winter Actions
1. **Log Suit and Spear**: Craft a log suit and spear to kill spiders and destroy nests for silk.
2. **Top Hat**: Wear a top hat until it is at 1% for future crafting of a prestihatitator.

## Lureplant Strategy
- Use a lureplant in the Beefalo herd to kill one or two, then steal the big meat for drying racks.

## Meat Effigy and Beard Shavings
1. **Meat Effigy**: Cook 4 meat and save it for making a meat effigy, which will resurrect you if you die.
2. **Beard Shavings**: Lower your sanity to below 50 to turn rabbits into beardlings for beard shavings.

## Final Thoughts
With a well-set camp, infinite jerky/meat, protection, and a means of resurrection, you are set to not starve forever. Enjoy the game!

# Attention: This page is for console commands from the Base Game (along with its dlcs). If you are trying to use console commands for Don't Starve Together then please use this Page.

## Command Console
The Command Console is enabled by default. If for whatever reason it is not, you first need to do some tweaking in your settings.ini of your save. This can be found in the "donotstarve" folder, located in the following paths:

- Windows: `%userprofile%\Documents\Klei\DoNotstarve\settings.ini`
- Mac: `<Documents>\Klei\DoNotstarve\settings.ini`
- Linux: `~/.klei/DoNotStarve/settings.ini`

Locate the settings.ini and open it with Notepad and where it says `[MISC]ENABLECONSOLE = false` and rewrite it as `[MISC]ENABLECONSOLE = true` then save the document.

To open the console while in game by pressing "~" by default on English keyboards. This can be changed at any time in the controls menu. Also, you can hide the console menu again by pressing Ctrl + L.

You will need to run this command once to enable console commands:
`RunScript("consolecommands")`

**Note:** Like many other command-line interfaced programs, the user can press the upper arrow key to get access to previously entered commands, with no need to re-type them manually again. However, the player will still have to re-enter every command after re-entering a world.

## Simple commands
- **Spawn prefab**
  ```
  c_spawn("prefab", amount)
  ```
  Improved DebugSpawn("prefab"), spawns amount of selected "prefab" under the mouse cursor.

- **Give Item**
  ```
  c_give("prefab", amount)
  ```
  Spawns amount of selected "prefab" in your inventory. Only works with Backpacks and Items that can be stored in the inventory.

- **Scenario (Not tested)**
  ```
  c_doscenario(scenario)
  ```
  Apply a scenario script to the selection and run it.

- **Health**
  ```
  c_sethealth(percent)
  ```
  Sets your health to selected percentage. Note: Use fractional numbers 0.90 = 90%.

- **Sanity**
  ```
  c_setsanity(percent)
  ```
  Sets your sanity to selected percentage. Note: Use fractional numbers 0.90 = 90%.

- **Hunger**
  ```
  c_sethunger(percent)
  ```
  Sets your hunger to selected percentage. Note: Use fractional numbers 0.90 = 90%.

- **God Mode**
  ```
  c_godmode()
  c_supergodmode()
  ```
  It won't drain Sanity, Hunger or Health when attacked anymore. Note that you will need to turn it off and on again after passing through a Worm Hole, sleeping, Telepoofing, entering or exiting a cave system, eating mandrakes, dying/respawning, or using complicated commands too many times. (In the Hamlet DLC, entering/exiting interiors will not break it, but being transported by the BFB will.)

- **Save the game**
  ```
  c_save()
  ```

- **Rollback**
  ```
  c_reset()
  ```
  Rollback to the last save / reloads frontend.

- **Reload**
  ```
  c_reload()
  ```

- **Regenerate world**
  ```
  c_regeneratecurrentworld()
  c_regenerateallworlds()
  ```
  Regenerates current or all worlds in the saveslot.

- **Regenerate cave**
  ```
  c_regeneratecave()
  ```
  Hover the cave entrance to Regenerate cave.

- **Set running speed**
  ```
  c_speed(value)
  ```
  Standard runspeed is 1. 10 makes the player a bit faster and with 40 they can walk through walls and "over" water.

- **Set running speed (Don't Starve Together)**
  ```
  c_speedmult(multiplier)
  ```
  Does the same before but for Don't Starve Together.

There's some other commands, but they're hard to use and not very useful.

## Player commands
- **Hide and show HUD**
  ```
  GetPlayer().HUD:Hide()
  GetPlayer().HUD:Show()
  ```
  Hide or show (after hiding) the full HUD of the game.

- **Creative mode**
  ```
  c_freecrafting()
  GetPlayer().components.builder:GiveAllRecipes()
  ```
  You can craft everything for free. This includes items you never crafted before. After switching levels, you will need to re-enter the command.

- **Maximum health**
  ```
  GetPlayer().components.health:SetMaxHealth('value
