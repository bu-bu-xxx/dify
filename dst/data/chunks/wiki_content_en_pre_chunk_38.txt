Blubber is an item in the Shipwrecked DLC. It is used to craft Blubber Suits and Windbreakers. Hacking a fully bloated Blue Whale Carcass or White Whale Carcass will drop 2 to 6 Blubber. Blubber cannot be Cooked or used in a Crock Pot. When eaten, it grants 10 Health, and 10 Hunger.

## Overview

* **Renewal**: No (except in Hamlet DLC: Yes)
* **Icon**: ![Fireflies](Fireflies.png)
* **Stack Size**: 40
* **Tool**: Can be [Catched] with a [Bug Net](Tools#Net_Tools)
* **Burn Time**: 3 minutes

* **Perk**: Can be released to emit light.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "If only I could catch them!"
- Willow: "I wish they didn't run away!"
- Wolfgang: "Sparkly!"
- Wendy: "A tiny brightness in the dark."
- WX-78: "BIOLUMINESCENT INSECTS"
- Wickerbottom: "They disperse when I approach."
- Woodie: "Reminds me of Algonquin park."
- Maxwell: "How pretty."
- Wagstaff: "An exploitable source of bioluminescence."
- Wigfrid: "Tiny fairy lights aglöw!"
- Webber: "Elusive little buggies."
- Walani: "My kind of insects."
- Warly: "A dash of glow."
- Woodlegs: "Tiny constellations. No good for navigation."
- Wilba: "A LIGHT THROUGH YONDER BUG BUTT BREAKS"
- Wormwood: "Glow Bums"
- Wheeler: "Now, where am I going to put you guys."
- Winona: "Natural light, huh? Might be useful."
- Wortox: "Some natural light to grant me sight."
- Wurt: "Come back, flurp!"
- Walter: "I wish I had a jar."
- Wanda: "I'll take some light wherever I can get it."

## Gameplay
Fireflies are passive light-producing mobs that appear at night in Forest and Grassland Biomes and all the time in Caves, mainly in Mushtree Forests. They are used to make the Miner Hat and Pumpkin Lantern. Fireflies can also be used to refuel Miner Hats and Lanterns by 39%.

## Capture
Fireflies can be captured with a Bug Net by pressing the "Do Action" button (Spacebar by default) when nearby. Because they do not respawn, they are considered a finite resource. Under certain situations (PC) it may not be possible to catch the fireflies with the "Do Action" button whilst you are near them and they are not emitting light. Therefore use a torch or setup a campfire nearby, change to the bug net to click on them using the mouse to walk up and catch them.

## Night Survival
Standing in Firefly light resets the timer in which Charlie will attack during the night, though the light from Fireflies will disappear until the player leaves their vicinity. If the player does not have a source of fire, that player may walk into and out of a group of Fireflies for survival during the night. This can still be dangerous, as Sanity will drop significantly.

## Base Camp Lighting
Releasing Fireflies near a Fire Pit or other key locations in one's base camp might come in handy, as glowing light will indicate their positions in total darkness of the night.

## Building Obstruction
Fireflies on the ground will take up space, so the player is unable to build in that spot unless they are caught.

## Downloadable Content
- **Reign of Giants**: Fireflies are found abundantly in Deciduous Forest Biomes, making it one of their natural habitats.
- **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked**: Fireflies are found in Jungle Biomes and do not appear during Hurricane Season. Fireflies are also used to craft the Boat Lantern. There is a small chance that fireflies can be obtained from a slot machine, thus making fireflies renewable.
- **Don't Starve: Hamlet**: Fireflies can be found in Rainforest and Deep Rainforest Biomes. Fireflies will appear at dusk if the player is under the canopies of Deep Rainforest and Gas Rainforest.

## Usage
### Miner Hat
- **Ingredients**: Straw Hat, Gold Nugget, Fireflies
- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine
- **Result**: Miner Hat

### Pumpkin Lantern
- **Ingredients**: Pumpkin, Fireflies
- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine
- **Result**: Pumpkin Lantern

### Boat Lantern (Shipwrecked DLC)
- **Ingredients**: Empty Bottle, Twigs (x2

### Quotes
- Wilson: He's so cute!
- Willow: He's too damp to burn.
- Wolfgang: Hey little froggy, froggy.
- Wendy: He's little and warty.
- WX-78: POTENTIAL BUNWICH.
- Wickerbottom: An amphibian tetrapod.
- Woody: I don't trust anything that can't decide between air and water.
- Maxwell: It jumps and licks things.
- Wagstaff: A impressive criminal of the animal kingdom!
- Wigfrid: I'd like frög bööts sömeday.

- Wurt: How you do?
- Walter: That doesn't look like the frogs in my handbook...
- Wanda: Don't even try it frogs, I'm one step ahead of you.

## Hunting
Unlike many other small animals, Frogs cannot be stunlocked and will continue attacking their enemy. To kill a Frog without taking damage, the player must run in, attack, and run out again quickly while the Frog attacks, known as kiting.

### Downloadable Content
In the Hamlet-compatible worlds, Frogs can be set on fire.

### Frog Rain
In any Adventure Mode world with Rain, heavy rainfall can rain Frogs. "A Cold Reception" has the most frequent rain and therefore the highest chances of Frog Rain.

### Tips
- Frogs from a frog rain can easily kill a Moose/Goose without intervention from the player, although many frogs will die in the process.

### Trivia
- Frogs will Sleep forever if a Pan Flute is used on them.
- Frogs can hit Krampus or other item-holding mobs and knock items out of their inventory.
- Frog Rain might be a reference to the biblical story of Moses, in which Egypt was plagued by millions of frogs.
- Don't Starve Frogs resemble real-life South American Horned Frogs in both appearance and aggression.

## Description
Unagi is a **Meat** Food item cooked in the **Crock Pot** by adding 1 **Eel** and 1 **Lichen**. It takes 10 seconds to cook. Unagi has the highest **Crock Pot Priority** (20) in the **Don't Starve** base game. This means that placing an Eel and Lichen into any recipe will always result in Unagi.

It restores less **Hunger** than the Eel and Lichen combined, but heals 20 **HP** and 5 **Sanity**, so it can be useful whenever player's health is low. However, it **spoils** in 10 days (which is also affected by the Lichen's fast spoil time), so it is recommended to only cook it when needed or put it in an **Ice Box**.

A **Wobster** is a catchable sea creature found in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. Wobsters spawn from **Wobster Den**s, which house one Wobster each. Wobsters are nocturnal, and will only come out at **Dusk**, will stay out all through the **Night**, and will retreat back to their dens when the next **day** begins. Players who get too close will also cause them to be scared and go back to their dens.

They can be caught using **Sea Trap**s or a **Trawl Net**. They are attracted to **Limpets**, which can be used to bait the trap to improve chances of catching them. Leaving them caught in a trap will cause them to starve to death in 1.5 game days, dropping one **Rot** instead. Wobsters that have been dropped on land by the player will not move and will die after a short amount of time.

When caught alive, they can be used in **Crock Pot** recipes. As inventory items, they can be murdered by right-clicking them to produce a **Dead Wobster**. The dead version can only be eaten raw or cooked, and cannot be used in Crock Pot recipes.

Wobsters take 1 blast from the **Ice Staff** to be frozen and 1 **Sleep Dart** to be put to sleep.

- Wolfgang: Wolfgang wish he had fearsome hand claws!
- Wendy: It's met its maker. I've met my lunch.

A **Dead Wobster** is obtained by right-clicking on a live Wobster in the inventory. It can be cooked over a fire, but cannot be used in the Crock Pot.

# Boarilla
The Boarilla is a hostile [Mob] in the [The Forge] event exclusive to [Don't Starve Together]. They are the strongest mob in the Forge, excluding the [Grand Forge Boarrior]. It is a large primate, resembling an orangutan with red, spiky armor. It has large forearms and small hind legs.

## Abilities
- **Uppercut**: Boarillas will pursue the player they are attacking. Once they get close, they will swipe up, knocking the player back.
- **Slam-leap**: Once the Boarilla gets below a certain health threshold, it will begin to do a roll attack.
- **Roll**: This attack, while can be sidestepped, can often leave players rolled over by the attack; it also has a secondary effect where, if dodged, the Boarilla can move his rolling path to hit again.
- **Leap Attack**: Once the Boarilla reaches the final health threshold, it will begin to do a leap attack, which will hit all players around where it lands.
- **Shield Defense**: The Boarilla can also hide behind its armor, which prevents it from taking damage.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "He's got a strong arm on him."
- **Willow**: "You can't push me around."
- **Wolfgang**: "Wolfgang is stronger than you!"
- **Wendy**: "You shall fall."
- **WX-78**: "BRUTISH AND STUPID"
- **Wickerbottom**: "All brawn and no brain, I'm afraid."
- **Woodie**: "Mighty powerful right hook on that hoser."
- **Maxwell**: "What a brute!"
- **Wigfrid**: "Let us battle with hönör!"
- **Webber**: "No monkey business, mister!"
- **Winona**: "He's justa big meathead."

## Tips
- The tossing from the Boarilla's attack can be countered by the Steadfast Stone Armor's knock back resistance.
- Characters with gear enabling a total of 20% speed increase can outrun the Boarilla without getting hit.
- If using standard Darts, the runner can also help their teammates with the weaker mobs by waiting until the Boarilla uses his shield and shooting a special at the mobs.
- Woodie can neuter the Boarilla, if the timing of the Chuck Lucy special ability is precise enough.

## Trivia
- The Boarilla's spawn code is `<code>"trails"</code>`. However, it's impossible to spawn Boarillas in the regular game.
- Despite the fact that "Boarilla" is a portmanteau of the words "boar" and "gorilla", it resembles an orangutan with the orange fur and flanged face.
- The Boarilla has tiny birdlike feet which can be seen by looking below its waist.

They can also uproot Tree stumps for 1 **Log**, and chopped **Mushtrees** for 1 Log. Additionally, the Shovel can dig up **Rabbit Hole**s, but doing so will permanently remove the hole and prevent any more rabbits from spawning at that spot. The Shovel can also be used to dig up **Grave**s to acquire **Gravedigger Items** at the cost of -10 **Sanity** per Grave dug.

## Skins

In **Don't Starve Together**, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the **Belongings** page.

- Butter gave 80 research points when used on a Science Machine in the early beta of Don't Starve.
- Wilson's quote "I can't believe it's butter!" is a reference to the margarine brand "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!"

## Tips
- Having four spare Monster Meat, feeding them to a Pig (resulting in it turning into a Werepig) and then slaying the Werepig can result in the player receiving all of the necessary ingredients needed for crafting, excluding the Twigs.
- The unlimited uses make it ideal for dealing damage to mobs and entities that don't fight back, like Spider Den and Snurtles.
- It is also an efficient weapon against Bosses due to their large Health pools.
- It's more effective to craft the Ham Bat in Winter because during that season spoilage rate is reduced by 25%.
- The Ham Bat can be crafted from spoiled meat and will be fully fresh when crafted. This makes it handy to be crafted right before a fight.
- Player can use a Bundling Wrap to contain and preserve large amounts of Meat for indefinite time, allowing them to always have the possibility of crafting Ham Bats without the need of hunting for Meat beforehand.

## Trivia
- The Ham Bat was added in the "A Little Rain Must Fall" update.
- The Ham Bat makes an appearance as the [Ham Shank](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Ham_Shank) in the popular online first-person shooter Team Fortress 2 to promote

A **Sea Hound** is a hostile **Mob** found in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. They may be encountered alone at sea, or attack the player in large packs while they are sailing.

Meats dropped into any part of the **Ocean** have a chance to spawn either one **Crocodog** or 2-4 Sea Hounds (60% chance of a Crocodog and 40% chance of Sea Hounds). The meat does not have to be dropped by the player themselves. The probability of an attack is based on the hunger value of the item dropped into the sea, and can be calculated by dividing the hunger value of a single item in the stack by 200. This means that the size of the stack does not increase the odds of an attack, but a large number of separate stacks of meat (such as those dropped by puncturing a bloated **Whale** carcass) can trigger a massive feeding frenzy. **Monster Food**, **Roe**, and **Shark Fin**s will not trigger an attack.

Because they lose interest in the player easily, Sea Hounds may get distributed in the ocean and later be re-encountered.

## Fighting Strategy
*Weapon Hits:*  
- Health: 150  
- Ice Staff: 2 hits  
- Sleep Dart: 3 hits  
- Water: Yes

## Tips

- Unlike Crocodogs, Sea Hounds cannot be stun-locked or set on fire. Their fast attack speed and spawning in groups also makes kiting and avoiding damage very difficult. Their only weaknesses are their relatively low health and inability to move onto land.
- The **Quackering Ram** and the **Harpoon** are perfect to use against them as Sea Hounds will die in one hit to these weapons and the player is able to easily avoid damage. A **Trident** is also very effective if the player can dodge the Sea Hound’s first attack since this weapon will kill it before it can make a second attack.
- Using poisoned, ranged weapons like the **Poison Spear** + **Speargun** or **Poison Dart** against Sea Hounds can make kiting significantly easier as it slows their movement and attacks to more manageable speeds.

## Trivia

- Sea Hounds don't attack **Sea Walls**.
- Sea Hounds were once used to replace Hounds in their periodic attacks, if the player was at sea. This feature was removed in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#November 21st, 2017 - Home Sea Home Update**, adding **Crocodog**s which can traverse both land and water. While Hounds can no longer be encountered in the DLC at all (except via the **Slot Machine**), Sea Hounds were accidentally removed from the game, but were later added back in their current functionality.
- A **Cargo Boat** may randomly be found at sea containing some loot, but jumping on the boat will trigger a Sea Hound attack.
- When Sea Hounds are approaching, Wilson may comment with "I'm going to need a bigger boat!". This is a reference to the movie **Jaws**, in which a lead character says "We're gonna need a bigger boat!", while being stalked by a

Beefy Greens is a Food Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together introduced in Return of Them. It is cooked in a Crock Pot by combining at least 1 Leafy Meat and a Vegetable value of at least 3.0. It has a Crock Pot Priority of 25 and it takes 40 seconds to cook. It's a grade-B Dragonpie because it conveys the same benefits, but only lasts 6 days instead of 15.

Beefy Greens technically count as a Meat item in DST, making Wigfrid accept it as food while Wurt and Beefalo refuse to eat it.

## Recipe

- **Item 1**: Leafy Meats
- **Item 2**: Vegetables (≥ 3.0)
- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Beefy Greens

## Examples

1. Leafy Meats + Carrot (x3) = Beefy Greens
2. Leafy Meats + Cactus Flesh + Popcorn + Ripe Stone Fruit = Beefy Greens
3. Leafy Meats + Lichen + Popperfish + Corn Cod = Beefy Greens

## Tips

- Including Kelp Fronds or any Mushrooms will not result in Beefy Greens as they only provide a vegetable value of 0.5 each.

## Trivia

- Beefy Greens were introduced in the Troubled Waters update.

## Tips
- The lightning strikes can easily be neutralized by constructing a Lightning Rod next to the Station.
- WX-78 can benefit from triggering the lightning strikes, in order to gain System Overload.
- It is possible to constantly damage and then repair the Station to reap its drops, each repair costing 3-4 Thulecite per Hammer strike. However, Shadow Creatures will spawn more often than loot, so be prepared for combat if you are planning to do this.

# Regal Shovel

- **Icon:** ![Regal Shovel](Regal Shovel.png)
- **Tier:** 2
- **Filter:** ![Tools Filter](Pic32|Tools Filter)
- **Ingredients:**
  - **Ingredient 1:** Twigs (Multiplier: 4)
  - **Ingredient 2:** Gold Nugget (Multiplier: 2)
- **Damage:** 17
- **Durability:** 100 uses (Dig)
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** "goldenshovel"
- **Perk:** Used for digging
- **Description:** Lasts longer, digs the same stuff.

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** I can't wait to dig holes.
- **Willow:** It won't make flaming pits, but at least it's shiny.
- **Wolfgang:** Fancy shovel is good hole maker.
- **Wendy:** At least I can dig with style.
- **WX78:** GOLD IS MORE DURABLE?
- **Wickerbottom:** The most malleable of metals, but let's see how this digs.
- **Woodie:** Time to dig golden holes.
- **Maxwell:** This shovel is worth a princely sum.
- **Wagstaff:** Strangely more durable than its stone counterpart.
- **Wigfrid:** Digging like a king!
- **Webber:** We're gonna dig so many holes.
- **Walani:** I'm digging this fancy shovel.
- **Warly:** Shiny.
- **Woodlegs:** Perfect for buryin' me treasures.
- **Wilba:** 'TIS BIG SHOVEL O' SHINY
- **Wormwood:** Pretty digger
- **Wheeler:** A little gaudy for my taste.
- **Winona:** A little too snazzy for my taste.
- **Wortox:** Luxuriously unnecessary! Hyuyu!
- **Wurt:** Fancy tool for digging in dirt.

## Usage
To dig up an item with the Shovel, right-click it from the inventory to equip it and right-click on the object. The player will dig up the object and an item will appear on the ground.

Shovels can be used to dig up:
- Plants such as Berry Bushes, Grass, and Saplings to replant them in a more desirable location.
- Uproot Tree stumps for 1 Log, regardless of their size, and chopped Mushtrees, also for 1 Log.
- Dig up Rabbit Holes, but doing so will permanently remove the hole and prevent any more rabbits from spawning at that particular spot.
- Dig up Graves to acquire Gravedigger Items at the cost of -10 Sanity per Grave dug.

The digging animation for the Shovel can be cut short by moving after the player digs up anything. This speeds up the process of mass-clearing objects when holding spacebar.

## Skins
- **Woven - Elegant Ornate Nordic Shovel:** A resplendent golden shovel, its design reminiscent of days of yore. ![Ornate Nordic Shovel](Ornate Nordic Shovel Icon.png) [[See ingame](Ornate Nordic Shovel Wilson.png)]
- **Woven - Classy Pantomimed Regal Shovel:** Convey an incredibly convincing impression of an expensive shovel. ![Pantomimed Regal Shovel](Pantomimed Regal Shovel Icon.png) [[See ingame](Pantomimed Regal Shovel Wilson.png)]

## Trivia
In reality, gold is not a practical metal to be used in tools or weapons as it's a soft metal; it would easily deform and break. This is often remarked when examined by some Characters.

## Tips
- When comparing the minimum ingredients required to cook it to the output, this is the least efficient dish in the game, losing even more stat points over its ingredients than the joke dish Powdercake. As such, even Warly players should opt for other uses for their potatoes; such as Fancy Spiralled Tubers for similar hunger to its ingredients and some sanity, Creamy Potato Purée for benefits similar to a cooked potato and 33 sanity (Keep in mind Warly cannot eat cooked potatoes himself), or simply hand them to other players in a multiplayer setting as potatoes cooked over a fire have great stats.

# Quacken

**Shipwrecked Exclusive Boss Mob**

## Mob Information
- **Name:** Quacken
- **Special Ability:** Lobs ink bombs, spawns Quacken Tentacles.
- **Spawn Code:** "kraken"
- **Drops:** 
  - [Chest of the Depths](link to Chest of the Depths)
  - [Booty Bag](link to Booty Bag)
  - [Quacken Beak](link to Quacken Beak)
  - [Iron Key](link to Iron Key) (first time only)
- **Damage:** 50
- **Health:** 1000
- **Attack Period:** 15

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Now's not the time for me to be Quacken wise!"
- Willow: "Kill it with fire!"
- Wolfgang: "Crummy breadeater!"
- Wendy: "Kneel to me, foul beast!"
- WX-78: "WHAT'S THE NATURAL PURPOSE OF THIS ABOMINATION?"
- Wickerbottom: "Octopodes have numerous defensive strategies."
- Woodie: "For Lucy!"
- Maxwell: "You will bow to me."
- Wagstaff: "What an awe-inspiring vitriolic creature! I need a closer look!"
- Wigfrid: "I'll return yöu tö Hel herself!"
- Webber: "Run away!"
- Walani: "Surf's up!"
- Warly: "I can't take the heat! Get me out of this kitchen!"
- Woodlegs: "Tis th'mightiest beast in th'sea!"
- Wilba: "UNEASY LIES THE HEAD 'NEATH THE WATER!"
- Wormwood: "Angry Beaker"
- Wheeler: "Am I supposed to be impressed? Because I am."

## Behavior
The Quacken is a giant brownish-blue creature with three eyes and many tentacles. It drops an Iron Key (only if Woodlegs hasn't been unlocked yet, and once per world), a Booty Bag, and a Chest of the Depths when killed. Quacken will spawn while the player is using a Trawl Net in Deep Ocean or ship graveyard (dark colored ocean tiles near Wrecks). Each item caught in the net has a 5% chance to spawn the Quacken. Once killed, another one won't spawn for 20 days. A Quacken will despawn if the player gets too far away.

## Fighting Strategy
The Quacken is a relatively easy boss mob to kill. When facing the Quacken, the biggest dangers to the player are boat damage and Wetness caused by the continuous surge of Big Waves created by the Quacken's tentacles. It is very likely that the player's boat will lose a significant portion of its durability while fighting the Quacken. For this reason, using a fully repaired, durable boat (such as the Armored Boat) and having at least one Boat Repair Kit in the player's inventory is recommended. Water resistant clothes are also recommended, as the waves will quickly soak any player not wearing them.

## Tips
- Quackens can be summoned quickly by attaching a Trawl Net and repeatedly dropping one buoyant item such as Twigs or Cut Grass in front of the player's boat while paddling in the Deep Ocean (CTRL + Click will drop one item while holding a stack). This process will roll the 5% spawn chance much more frequently than using the Trawl Net normally.
- Purple Grouper or Tropical Bouillabaisse can be eaten before and during a Quacken battle to provide immunity to both Wetness and boat damage from the Big Waves created by the tentacles, making the fight significantly easier.
- Befriending Bottlenose Ballphins is an alternative to water-proof clothes to offset the sanity drain from Wetness.

## Trivia
- Quacken's name is a portmanteau on the name of the Kraken, a legendary sea monster that looks like a giant octopus, and "quack", an onomatopoeia of a duck's call.
- The attack in which it lobs a large ball of black ink towards the player is a parallel to a defense mechanism used by real-life octopodes and squid.

- Wurt: Run away!!
- Walter: Look at those razor sharp claws! I need to get a closer view!
- Wanda: All the worst parts of a bear and a badger rolled into one.
- Choose: Wigfrid

## Behavior

### General

Bearger appears after 1/4 of Autumn's days have passed, which, with default settings, is 5 days, so day 76 during the second year with default settings, while looking for Food to eat. Bearger is particularly attracted to Bee Boxes and will be satiated by eating 10 Honey, after which it will fall asleep. However, it will prioritize fighting the player over eating Honey when provoked.

### Attacks

| Attack | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Swipe  | Bearger will use a swipe attack at close range, dealing damage and knocking the weapon out of the player's hand. It will use this attack up to three consecutive times before using its slam attack. |
| Slam   | Once Bearger has used 3 swipes, it will slam the ground with its front paws, creating a shockwave that will demolish Structures, fell Trees, and uproot Plants in a large area as well as knock the player's weapon from their hand. This attack only does damage within Bearger's melee range, despite damaging objects at a larger distance. |
| Charge | If the player runs away from Bearger when it is about to do its slam attack, it will charge after the player, destroying objects in its path. When it either catches up to the player or has been running for long enough, it will use its slam attack. |

## Strategy

### General Melee

- The player can attack Bearger 3-4 times before having to dodge, except after it slams the ground, as a swipe attack follows immediately after. Using Roads or other means of speed increase for kiting may allow for a third hit if timed correctly.
- Equipping at least a Log Suit or Football Helmet is recommended.
- Weapons may be knocked into the water when fighting Bearger near an ocean.
- Fighting Bearger in melee range could drain a player's sanity in a few minutes. This creates an additional hazard, especially when fighting after dusk, as Shadow Creatures may also attack.

### Burst Damage

One of the fastest ways to deal with any boss in Don't Starve is a combination of immobilization and either the Old Bell or 14 Gunpowder. First, the player must immobilize Bearger by either freezing it with an Ice Staff or sedating it with Sleep Darts or a Pan Flute. A stack of 10 Honey may also be used to sedate Bearger, however it may need to be immobilized more than once, depending on how quickly the following tactics are used:

# Reanimated Skeleton

The **Reanimated Skeleton** is a **Boss Monster** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**.

There are 3 variants: **Forest**, **Caves**, & **Ancient Fuelweaver**.

## Forest

- **Health**: 4000
- **Walk Speed**: 2.4
- **Spawn From**: [[Odd Skeleton]]
- **Spawn Code**: "stalker_forest"
- **Drops**: [[Shadow Atrium]] and 8 [[Fossils]]
- **Special Ability**: Creates a path of [[Lesser Glow Berry]], [[Light Flower]], and [[Fern]]
- **Sanity Drain**: -400/min
- **Shadow Aligned**: 1

### Behavior

The Reanimated Skeleton walks around aimlessly, destroying any structures it walks through, and leaves a trail of [[Lesser Glow Berry]], [[Light Flower]]s, and [[Ferns]]. The plants will disappear after a few seconds. When idle, its arm will fall off and it will heal itself with its other arm. After dropping its arm twice, it will grab its head and shake it furiously due to the long distance it has from the [[Ruins]].

## Cave

- **Health**: 4000
- **Damage**: 100
- **Attack Period**: 4
- **Attack Range**: 2.4
- **Walk Speed**: 4.2
- **Spawn From**: [[Odd Skeleton]]
- **Spawn Code**: "stalker"
- **Drops**: [[Shadow Atrium]], 8 [[Fossils]], and 2-4 [[Nightmare Fuel]]
- **Special Ability**: Snare enemies
- **Sanity Drain**: -400/min
- **Shadow Aligned**: 1

### Behavior

The Reanimated Skeleton attacks by ripping off its head and swiping at an enemy; this does not have any AoE but will hit anything in the direction it is attacking. After its health has been decreased significantly, it will slam the ground trapping multiple players and other creatures in a fence of sharp bones. The bones will turn to dust after a few seconds.

## Ancient Fuelweaver

- **Health**: 16000
- **Damage**: 100 (on direct attack), 100 (on upwards bone hit)
- **Attack Period**: 3
- **Attack Range**: 2.4
- **Walk Speed**: 4.2
- **Spawn From**: [[Odd Skeleton]]
- **Spawn Code**: "stalker_atrium"
- **Drops**: 8 [[Fossils]], 2-4 [[Nightmare Fuel]], [[Shadow Thurible]], [[Bone Helm]], [[Bone Armor]], and a [[Rose]] if the player kills it
- **Special Ability**: Snare enemies, Spawn fossil spike, Talk aloud, Regain health from eating Woven Shadows, Shield up, Mind control, Turn off the [[Ancient Gateway]]
- **Sanity Drain**: -400/min
- **Shadow Aligned**: 1

### Behavior

The Ancient Fuelweaver will immediately start chasing and attacking the player, it will confine the player in a bone cage if the player is too far away. In different stages, it will spawn multiple [[Woven Shadow]]s that it will eat to regain health.

The Ancient Fuelweaver has two stages:
- **Stage 1 (Health 16000-10000)**
- **Stage 2 (Health 10000-0)**

After its defeat, the Ancient Gateway will start to destabilize, consuming the Ancient Key and killing all nearby Shadow Creatures. After 4 minutes, the [[Ruins]] regenerate.

The gate will have a recharge time of 20 days before being able to insert another Ancient Key. If the player leaves the fight, then it will decay, leaving behind 8 Fossils, 2-4 Nightmare Fuel, and a [[Shadow Atrium]].

## Quotes

When examining a Reanimated Skeleton, the players will say different quotes based on their character. Here are a few examples:

- **Wilson**: The skeleton fused with the shadows!
- **Willow**: I brought you back so I could beat you up!
- **Wolfgang**: Skeleton should not be walking!
- **WX-78**: YOU WILL BE DESTROYED

# Pengulls

## Behavior

Pengulls are neutral mobs that appear on shores in packs of around 7 during Winter. The colony size will continually grow until the end of Winter. They spawn in the Ocean and jump onto the shore only if the player is nearby. If a single Pengull is attacked, the entire colony will slide on their bellies towards the attacker if they are close enough to the player. Together they surround their target and deal massive amounts of damage, as well as pursue the attacker if they flee. If the player bumps into a single Pengull, they will slide away in the direction opposite to the bump. Pengulls may drop a Jet Feather, Morsel, or Drumstick.

Pengulls are considered innocent creatures, and killing one will add 2 Naughtiness points, which can cause Krampus to appear.

### Quotes

- Wilson: "Must be breeding season."
- Willow: "Run away, tiny dancers."
- Wolfgang: "Funny walking birds!"
- Wendy: "All dressed up, but where to go?"
- WX-78: "BIRD CANNOT FLY?"
- Wickerbottom: "What a classy bird."
- Woodie: "Doesn't matter if you're from the Great White North. Still a bird."
- Maxwell: "Nice tux."
- Wagstaff: "Has a considerably larger beak than I'm used to."
- Wigfrid: "Birds of the sea, come from afar."
- Webber: "Where do they live the rest of the year?"
- Walani: "Hey little dude."
- Warly: "A cool customer."
- Woodlegs: "A sure sign o'ice at sea."
- Wilba: "TIS BIRDY O' FUNNY WADDLE"
- Wormwood: "Woddle Woddle"
- Wheeler: "You're going to get your suit dirty sliding around in it like that."
- Winona: "I don't mix well with the upper class."
- Wortox: "A bird that flies within the sea."
- Wurt: "They smart birds, would rather swim than fly."
- Walter: "I've never seen one up close before!"
- Wanda: "Is it Winter again already?"

## Strategy

An effective way of obtaining drops from the Pengulls without being mobbed by the flock is to chase one away from the group until the Pengull calls can no longer be heard before attacking.

Another effective strategy requires Gunpowder, even though this can be excessive since the expense in resources isn't worth the reward. One can get the Rotten Eggs from a Birdcage crafted before Winter, and the other materials from Boulders and burnt Trees. The use of Gunpowder will let the player get cooked food, but will lose the Feathers due to the fire turning them to Ashes.

Another strategy to farm Pengulls, albeit mildly dangerous, is to find a Killer Bee Hive and wait for Pengulls to spawn nearby. Once a sizable amount have made their way to a close by location, the player can prod the Killer Bees to chase it, then kite them over to the Pengulls. Getting out of range of the bees will eventually set their aggro onto the flock. This can be done daily and repeatedly as the Bees will replenish in about a game day's time, as well as the Pengulls.

Pengulls can be very useful as a way to eliminate Hounds when they come periodically to attack the player. All the player needs to do is run in circles around the Pengulls and wait until each Hound changes focus onto the Pengulls. With a full flock of Pengulls, this should eliminate all Hounds in small to moderate waves. From there, the player can easily kill weakened flocks. The player can usually get all dropped loot without it being immediately eaten.

If playing as Wendy, she can set Abigail's aggro on the Pengulls to kill them with ease, especially at dusk or better at night.

If playing as Woodie in Don't Starve Together, one can craft a Weremoose Kitschy Idol to get rid of Pengull packs easily.

## Trivia

- The name "Pengull" is a portmanteau of "penguin" and "seagull".
- Pengulls will also attempt to hide Eggs from caged birds if they are left on the ground, since both Eggs are identified as the same thing.
- If starting the game in Winter, the ice sheets of the Pengulls nesting grounds will not appear until day 6.
- Ice sheets can run onto the ocean, but they cannot be stepped on or flown over.
- Pengulls were originally called Penguins.
- Pengulls do not produce Manure, although they originally produced Manure that was half the size of regular Manure, which would become regular size once picked up.
