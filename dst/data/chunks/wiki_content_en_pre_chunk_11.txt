**Exclusivity**: Don't Starve Together

**For the equivalent Crafting Tab in Don't Starve**: Dress Tab

The **Clothing Filter** is a **Filter** in the crafting menu of **Don't Starve Together**. It contains a variety of **Hats** and other equipable items which make it easier to counter **Seasons**' effects such as **Freezing**, **Overheating**, or **Wetness**, often granting extra **Sanity** regeneration too.

Many of these items have **Durability**, which is consumed over time by simply wearing them. A **Sewing Kit** can be used to restore most Clothing items' durability, unless it is fully depleted, in which case the item is destroyed.

Here is the extracted information in Markdown format:

# Nightmare Light

- **Image**: ![Nightmare Light](Nightmare Light.png)
- **Spawns**: Terrorbeak, Crawling Horror
- **Biome**: Sacred, Military, Labyrinth
- **Spawn Code**: `nightmarelight`
- **Sanity Drain**: 0 (Calm), -600/min (Warning/Dawn), -900/min (Nightmare)

Nightmare Lights are light sources found within the Ruins. They cannot be opened or destroyed with a Hammer. Instead, the amount of light they emit depends on the current state of the Nightmare Cycle that the Ruins are in; the more extreme the magical state, the more the Nightmare Lights open up.

Nightmare Lights drain the player's Sanity when they are open and if the player is near. The actual magnitude of the drain depends on how much light is coming from the Nightmare Lights (how "open" they are). During the Warning phase they will drain 600 sanity/min, while in the Nightmare phase they will drain 900.

Shadow Creatures will appear around the lights, even if the player is not insane. The Shadow Creatures only appear during the Nightmare phase and are hostile to the player. Once the Nightmare Cycle is completely over, the creatures will die, dropping Nightmare Fuel in the process.

The lights are fueled by Nightmare Fuel extracted from unknown depths below. This is a major example of the excessive use of Nightmare Fuel by the Ancients that led to their downfall.

# Nightmare Fissure

- **Image**: 
  - Opened Level 2: ![Fissure Opened2](Fissure Opened2.png)
  - Opened Level 1: ![Fissure Opened1](Fissure Opened1.png)
  - Closed: ![Fissure Closed](Fissure Closed.png)
- **Spawns**: Terrorbeak, Crawling Horror
- **Biome**: Wilds, Village
- **Spawn Code**: `fissure`, `fissure_lower`

Nightmare Fissures are objects that appear in the Ruins and rarely in Caves, more specifically, on Stalagmite Terrain. They act identical to Nightmare Lights. Depending on the phase of the Nightmare Cycle, they emit more or less light - the greater the light radius, the higher the chance of spawning Shadow Creatures.

Each fissure can only spawn one creature, either a Terrorbeak or Crawling Horror. If the player has been detected by either one of these mobs, all other Terrorbeaks or Crawling Horrors in the vicinity will become solid and will be able to attack the player in a group. Once the fissure is closed, the first spawned Shadow Creature will automatically die, and the other ones will become neutral, assuming the player has enough Sanity.

Nightmare Fissures will reappear at the same location after a period of time. It is advisable to put a Sign or other item with a Map icon near these fissures to mark their locations, since these are the best places to find Nightmare Fuel.

---

## Trivia

- Nightmare Fissures were introduced in the Six Feet Under update.
- Sometimes, Nightmare Lights and Fissures will open during the Calm State. During this time, they will emit blue light instead of red or pink light.

# Green Gem

## Description
The **Green Gem** is an item used to craft two Ancient items. It can be used to craft the Construction Amulet, which raises Sanity as well as halves the resource cost of crafting items, and the Deconstruction Staff, which can be used to destroy structures/items and receive all of the resources used in their construction (barring Gems).

## Gathering
Green Gems can be obtained by mining Ancient Statues, destroying Broken Clockworks, opening Ornate Chests, and hammering Ancient Pseudoscience Stations in the Ruins.
Additional ways to acquire Green Gems are:
- The Dragonfly drops 1-2 Green Gems upon death.
- Spazmatism can be killed every 15 days for a guaranteed Green Gem.
- Green Gems can be gathered in the Ruins from Cave Holes by using The Lazy Forager. The Ruins can be regenerated by killing the Ancient Fuelweaver, so every time the Ancient Fuelweaver is killed, the player can regenerate new gems.
- The Large Ornate Chest has a chance to contain Green Gems each time the Ancient Guardian is killed.
- Sunken Chests have a chance of dropping Green Gems when hammered.
- Green Gems can be obtained from presents under a Winter's Feast Tree (only during Winter's Feast).
- The Table and Chair Relics have a roughly 0.2% chance to drop Green Gems when destroyed.
- Tumbleweeds have a 0.02% chance to drop Green Gems when harvested.
- Wilson can transmute Green Gems by using 3 Yellow Gem with the Transmute Gems III skill.

## Usage
### Crafting Recipes
- **Construction Amulet**
  - Green Gem
  - Nightmare Fuel (3)
  - Thulecite (2)
  - Tool: Broken Pseudoscience Station

- **Deconstruction Staff**
  - Green Gem (2)
  - Living Log (2)
  - Nightmare Fuel (4)
  - Tool: Broken Pseudoscience Station

- **Green Moonlens**
  - Green Gem
  - Cratered Moonrock
  - Note: Obtained by inserting the Gem into the Cratered Moonrock.

- **Iridescent Gem**
  - Yellow Gem
  - Orange Gem
  - Green Gem
  - Purple Gem
  - Red Gem
  - Blue Gem
  - Result: Iridescent Gem
  - Character: Wilson
  - Skill: Transmute Gems 3

## Tips
Because Green Gems are renewable, the items it can be crafted into can be utilized to make nearly any other item in the game renewable, by crafting something with the amulet at half-price and then deconstructing it with the Deconstruction Staff for a full return.

## Trivia
- The Green Gem uses the Red Gem's texture, only flipped and colored green.
- Despite also being green, the gem in Wormwood's body came from the moon.

| Wolfgang | Ah. Wolfgang forgot cannonballs. |
| ... | ... |
| Choose | Wilson |

The **Cannon** can be loaded with **Cannonballs** and be fired at a target in front of it. The Cannon's range of attack depends on the player's position, it will aim towards the opposite direction from where the player is standing which allows the Cannon to fire in any direction.

Cannons can be placed on a Boat or on the ground. Boats get pushed back in the opposite direction of a shot. On **Moon Quay**, Cannons can be found on **Docks** inhabited by **Powder Monkeys**, who use them as weapons and shoot at any approaching player Boats.

Cannons will not hit structures and walls on the same boat it was fired from, but they will still hit and hurt other things on the same boat like normal.

## Description
Suspicious Dirt Piles are naturally spawning objects that can be found randomly in the world and will change locations if players are more than 200 meters away. Once examined, the Suspicious Dirt Pile will be uncovered by the Character and replaced by an Animal Track pointing in the approximate direction of travel. Another pile of dirt will then spawn 40 meters away in that approximate direction, with a ±30° difference in the actual direction compared to the direction shown by the animal track.

Upon uncovering the final footprint (there can be between 6 and 12 per hunt), the character will alert the player that the creature is close. A Koalefant or an Ewecus will be spawned rather than another track. The chance for spawning an Ewecus starts at 5% on Day 1 and increases gradually to 33% on Day 100. The mob will remain in the world until it is killed, regardless of which Seasons pass.

The track will disappear after 37.5 seconds, terminating the hunt. The track will disappear after 22.5 seconds if there is rain or when the world wetness is more than 15. Players have to wait 5 seconds after their track has washed away before a new set of tracks will spawn for the player.

There is a cooldown of 432-720 seconds after completing a hunt.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Suspicious Dirt Piles have a 50% chance to lead to a Varg instead of an Ewecus. As such, on day 100 there will be a

# Chess Pieces

## Overview
Chess Pieces are craftable objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. There are eight different variants that can be crafted at a **Potter's Wheel** and are mostly meant for decoration. Nearly all of them are unlocked by giving their respective **Sketch** to the Potter's Wheel, except for the Bubble Pipe Carving and the Carved Hornucopia, which are always available. Players are able to sculpt Chess Pieces out of two **Rocks** and one **Marble**, **Cut Stone**, or **Moon Shard**. The chosen material determines the color of the crafted Chess Piece.

Chess Pieces can be carried by players in the chest slot, similar to **Suspicious Marble**, slowing down their movement speed and preventing them from several inventory actions, such as equipping a handheld item.

## Varieties

These structures act as impenetrable walls except to certain bosses. This can be used in the Moon Caller's Staff event to block off Spiders, Werepigs, and Hounds.

## Trivia
- Most Chess Pieces were added in the **A Little Fixer Upper** update, while the Giant Figures were introduced in an unnamed Bonus Update after the completion of **A New Reign**.
- The Bee Queen, Toadstool, Antlion, Ancient Fuelweaver, and Klaus figures were added in the May QoL update.
- Based off of character quotes, it is implied that the Kingly Figure refers to Maxwell, the Queenly figure to Charlie, and the Pawn to all the other playable characters.

# Treeguard Idol

The **Treeguard Idol** is a unique item exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It can only be crafted by **Woodie** with the **[Treeguard Feller III](#)** Skill, in his **Survivor Filter** or in the **Magic Filter**. It requires 3 **Cut Grass**, 2 **Living Logs**, and 5 **Nightmare Fuel** to craft.

## Description

- **Can Be Burned:** Yes
- **Icon:** ![Treeguard Idol](Treeguard%20Idol.png)
- **Image:** ![Treeguard Idol Dropped](Treeguard%20Idol%20Dropped.png)
- **Ingredients:**
  - **Cut Grass:** 3
  - **Living Log:** 2
  - **Nightmare Fuel:** 5 (only for **[Woodie](#)**)
- **Description:** Call upon the power of the trees.
- **Filter:** ![Woodie Filter](Woodie%20Filter.png) ![Magic Filter](Magic%20Filter.png)
- **Skill:** [Treeguard Feller III](#)
- **Skill Owner:** Woodie
- **Spawn Code:** `leif_idol`
- **Burn Time:** 3 min.
- **Stack:** Up to 10

The Idol can be used as fuel with the same efficiency as **Boards**, adding 180 seconds to a **Campfire** and 360 seconds to a **Fire Pit**.

When burnt in a Campfire or on the ground, the Treeguard Idol transforms nearby **Evergreens** and **Lumpy Evergreens** of any size into **Treeguards** of their respective type, or medium **Birchnut Trees** into **Poison Birchnut Trees**, similarly to spawning Treeguards when chopping Trees regularly.

Each Treeguard Idol burnt results in 2 Treeguards. They can be stacked up to 10 and burnt in a stack to spawn more Treeguards at once.

## Quotes

- **Wendy:** Let's play "funeral pyre."
- **Wilson:** Carving a tree out of wood seems a bit redundant.
- **Willow:** See how fun it is to burn trees? I knew he'd come around.
- **Wolfgang:** Beardman has made tiny tree.
- **WX-78:** HA! IT IS CARVED FROM ITS OWN DEAD ORGANIC MATTER
- **Wickerbottom:** I believe it requires the application of a flame.
- **Woodie:** To fight a tree, you gotta think like a tree...
- **Maxwell:** How very folksy.
- **Wigfrid:** Tribute to an ancient woodland being.
- **Warly:** Sometimes it's difficult to say whether he loves or hates trees.
- **Webber:** Aww, it's a little angry tree!
- **Winona:** That's some quality carving, there.
- **Wormwood:** Friend...?
- **Wortox:** A nice carving, but the pose is a little wooden, hyuyu!
- **Wurt:** Aww, little Treebeast!
- **Walter:** What a neat way to start a campfire!
- **Wanda:** What a funny little trinket!

## Trivia

* The Treeguard Idol was added in the **[Skill Spotlight: Wormwood, Wolfgang, Woodie](#)** Update.

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** I wouldn't want my boat to fly away.
- **Willow:** It better be the only thing going into the water today.
- **Wolfgang:** Ha! Shiny anchor is not heavy for Wolfgang!
- **Wendy:** Its golden luster will be lost beneath the sea.
- **WX78:** BETTER YOU IN THE WATER THAN ME
- **Wickerbottom:** One of the more curious uses for gold I've seen yet.
- **Woodie:** Pretty fancy for an anchor, eh?
- **Maxwell:** Such exquisite craftsmanship. Into the water it goes.
- **Wigfrid:** May it grip the sea floor with all its strength.
- **Webber:** Grab onto the sea floor real tight, okay?
- **Warly:** It seems a shame to drop such a dazzling thing into the sea.
- **Wormwood:** Hold onto sea bottom
- **Winona:** Awful fancy for somethin' that'll spend most of its time underwater.
- **Wortox:** Dipped in gold, now dropped in the drink.
- **Wurt:** Carful not to hurt any fishies on way down, florp!
- **Walter:** That's gotta be the fanciest anchor I've ever seen.
- **Wanda:** Quite the afternoonified anchor.

## Usage
The Claw Anchor can be deployed on a Boat. The Claw Anchor can then be lowered to prevent the Boat from drifting, or be raised to allow it to move again. The time it takes for the Anchor to rise depends on the depth of the Ocean:
- 2 seconds on Coastal Ocean and Brine Shoals
- 6 seconds on Swell Ocean
- 8 seconds in Rough Ocean
- 10 seconds in Hazardous Ocean
The time it takes for it to lower is a third of the raising time.

If an Anchor is hammered, it will leave a boat leak in its place.

A thing to keep in mind is that the anchor will not prevent the boat from drifting away if the sails are still open. They need to be closed; otherwise, the boat will still drift away slowly.

- **Wheeler:** You can never have enough storage space.

**Description:**
The Thatch Pack is a Backpack from the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC used to expand the player's Inventory. It has only 4 inventory slots, however it does not need to be prototyped and can be crafted from the start. It requires 4 Palm Leaves to craft and is flammable. Its capacity is less than that of the backpack, and thus it is not a useful item long-term, but it can be very useful to craft early-game if the player cannot find any gold nuggets on the first island or two they explore.

# Bird Whistle

Exclusive to the **Hamlet** DLC, the Bird Whistle is a craftable item found in the **Survival Tab**. It requires a **Hippopotamoose Antler**, three **Platapine Quills**, and a **Flint** to craft, and a **Science Machine** to prototype. The Bird Whistle is a required component for crafting the **Nightmarish Bird Whistle**.

## Description
- **Description**: For calling birds. Did you make it too big?
- **Durability**: 5 uses (*Playing Tools*)
- **Stacking**: Does not stack
- **Perk**: Spawns the **BFB** (*Big Foot Bird*)
- **Spawn Code**: "antler"

## Ingredients
- **Hippopotamoose Antler**: 1
- **Platapine Quill**: 3
- **Flint**: 1

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: For the birds.
- **Willow**: Here birdie birdie...
- **Wolfgang**: Wolfgang sings like little birdies.
- **Wendy**: Do you enjoy the wistful sound of bird song, Abigail?
- **WX-78**: FOR INTERFACING WITH FLYING FLESHLINGS
- **Wickerbottom**: I do enjoy a good bird song.
- **Woodie**: Ugh. Those birds don't deserve this.
- **Maxwell**: What use are birds to me?
- **Wagstaff**: A bird whistle that appears to call an exceedingly large bird.
- **Wigfrid**: It sööthes the feathered beasts.
- **Webber**: Now we can sing to the little birdies.
- **Walani**: Here birdy birdy.
- **Warly**: I can call the little birdies to me!
- **Woodlegs**: Fer tha'callin' o'tha feather'd beasties.
- **Wilba**: WILBA SING LIKE BIRDIES I' THE CAGE
- **Wormwood**: Sounds like Womp Tweeter
- **Wheeler**: Maybe this bird whistle will convince a bird to fly me out of here.

## Usage
Using the Bird Whistle causes the **BFB** to appear in the sky, eventually landing. This can be used to get to the fourth **Hamlet** island earlier than normal, and at will. This also allows **Dung Piles** to be easily renewed as the BFB drops several during its descent.

## Incompatibility
Using it in a **Reign of Giants** or **Shipwrecked** world won't work.

The '''Spectoggles''' are a [[Category:Hats|Hat]] [[Item]] craftable only by [[Wagstaff]]. They are found in the [[Tinkering Tab]] and require a [[Gold Nugget]] and a [[Pig Skin]] to craft. They allow a Wagstaff player to remove the blurriness effect due to Wagstaff's nearsightedness. However, when characters other than Wagstaff wear the Spectoggles, the world will appear blurry. They also reveal hidden dangers such as [[Tentacle]]s.

## Downloadable Content
In the ''[[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]]'' DLC, the Spectoggles reveal [[Flup]]s and [[Poisonous Hole]]s.

In the ''[[Hamlet]]'' DLC, the Spectoggles reveal [[Nasty Spear Trap]]s, [[Striking Carving]]s, and Pressure Plates. In addition, [[Peculiar Objects]] can be revealed, allowing Wagstaff to investigate Peculiar Objects. This can be done at no cost to item durability. The goggles also provide immunity to [[Fog]].

# Mushroom Planter

## Exclusivity
Don't Starve Together

## Structure Infobox
- **Picked**: Red Cap, Blue Cap, Green Cap, Rot
- **Tool**: Can be Hammered
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Ingredient 1**: Rot
- **Multiplier 1**: 8
- **Ingredient 2**: Manure
- **Multiplier 2**: 5
- **Ingredient 3**: Living Log
- **Multiplier 3**: 2
- **Filter**: Food & Gardening
- **Tier**: 1
- **Description**: Grow some growths.
- **Perk**: Grows Mushrooms.
- **Spawn Code**: "mushroom_farm"
- **Image**: Mushroom Planter Build.png

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It could use a spore. Or a mushroom transplant."
- Willow: "It's just a dumb log."
- Wolfgang: "Is nothing."
- Wendy: "Emptiness. The natural state of all things."
- WX-78: "IT IS FREE FROM ORGANIC GROWTHS"
- Wickerbottom: "It must first be seeded with a cut specimen or fungal spore."
- Woodie: "It needs a bit of help getting started."
- Maxwell: "Smells... 'piney'."
- Wigfrid: "An empty home for forest sprites."
- Webber: "There aren't any mushrooms."
- Winona: "Nothing yet."
- Warly: "I could grow some fresh mushrooms here."
- Wortox: "Just a log if you ask me!"
- Wormwood: "What happened, friend?"
- Wurt: "Needs mushrooms!"
- Walter: "It needs something to get started."
- Wanda: "I'm surprised there's no mushrooms growing out of this rotten log."
- Choose: Wilson

The Mushroom Planter is a craftable Structure exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in A New Reign. It requires 8 Rot, 5 Manure, and 2 Living Logs to craft, and a Science Machine to prototype. After placing it, one can grow Red, Green, and Blue Caps or Spores on it. Mushrooms can be harvested at any time, and will yield different amounts of the mushroom depending on how much they grew. If a spore was planted, there is a 50% chance that it will release a spore when it hits the max level.

Harvesting the Planter less than one day after planting it will only yield the one mushroom that was planted. Planting a Mushroom can yield a maximum of 4 Mushrooms per harvest, while Mushroom Spores can produce a maximum of 6 Mushrooms. They take 3.75 days to fully grow and can be harvested 4 times before it must be replenished with Living Logs.

On the surface, mushrooms can grow through all seasons except Winter. When it starts snowing in Winter, the mushrooms will all turn into Rots. In the Caves, however, mushrooms can be grown all year round; this makes it a reliable and sustainable method of Mushrooms farming in Caves.

Wormwood with Moon Shroom Cloud skill can plant Moon Shroom in the Mushroom Planter, and with Mushroom Multiplier skill, he can make the Mushroom Planter to produce a higher yield, from 4 caps to 6 caps in max level.

## Tips
- A good method of using Mushroom farming is to make camp near a green and blue Mushtree Forest, where one can collect spores of Blue Mushtrees in Winter and Green Mushtrees in Spring. This method yields lots of Blue Mushrooms for Health and Hunger and Green Mushrooms for Sanity, at a continuous cost of Living Logs.
- Wickerbottom and Maxwell can read Horticulture, Abridged or Horticulture, Expanded to make all Mushroom Planter in range immediately grow to max level.

## Trivia
- Mushroom Planters were introduced in the Arts and Crafts update.
- Maxwell's quote might be in reference to his quote for an Evergreen "I've heard them described as 'piney'." which is itself a reference to Wilson's quote "It's all piney."

## Quotes

- **Willow:** Strangely not for torching boats.
- **Wolfgang:** Flame on boat is good idea!
- **Wendy:** How illuminating.
- **WX-78:** MARINE ILLUMINATION

- **Wilba:** WHAT LIGHT!
- **Wormwood:** For dark times on floater
- **Wheeler:** Open fire on a wooden boat. The most adventurous thing I've ever done.
- **Choose:** wigfrid

A Boat Torch is a craftable Item in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked and Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. It is made with 2 Twigs and 1 Torch. It can be used to provide light on a Boat, other than the Log Raft and the Raft which have no slots for Boat Lights. Boat Torches must be attached to a boat and turned on to provide light. It can be turned off to preserve its fuel. It cannot be refueled, and will disappear when its fuel is consumed.

A better alternative to the Boat Torch is the Boat Lantern which has a durability of 7 min 48 sec.

## Trivia
- Crafting does not recognize an item's durability. Thus, using a torch with 1% durability works as well as a new one, and is a more efficient use of resources.

## Crafting

The **Fanged Bumper Kit** is a craftable item in the Offerings filter, exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** introduced in the **Year of the Dragonfly** event. It requires 3 **Lucky Gold Nugget** to craft and is used to strengthen the raft by installing a bumper on the edge of the vessel. It has 40 durability, which provides a small protection for the raft from collision damage. If it is damaged and not destroyed, the player can use **Twigs** to repair it.

## Description
'Merm Heads' are decorative structures usually found around Pig Villages or randomly in Swamps. They are severed Merm heads on sticks planted in the ground, similar to Pig Heads.

Destroying a Merm Head with a Hammer drops 2 Rot and 2 Twigs. Deconstructing a Merm Head with a Deconstruction Staff drops 4 Rot and 4 Twigs, although it cannot be constructed.

## Downloadable Content
During a Full Moon in the Reign of Giants DLC, Merm Heads' eyes will open and glow white and drop Nightmare Fuel when destroyed.

## Trivia
- Merm Heads can be found around the Pig Villages, while Pig Heads can be found around the Merm camps. This might symbolize the war between Pigs and Merms.
- When Wolfgang examines a Merm Head, he says, "What a handsome devil!", which is identical to what Wilson says about a Meat Effigy.

# Piggyback

- **Type**: Backpack
- **Crafting Requirements**: 4 Pig Skins, 6 Silk, 2 Ropes, and an Alchemy Engine for prototyping
- **Inventory Slots**: 12
- **Speed Penalty**: Reduces walking speed by 10% (20% in Don't Starve)
- **Fireproof**: Yes
- **Exclusive to**: Don't Starve, Reign of Giants, Shipwrecked, Hamlet, Don't Starve Together

## Description
The Piggyback is a larger backpack with 12 inventory slots but slows the wearer by 20% when worn. It has 4 more slots than a regular backpack but 2 less than the Krampus Sack. It cannot be placed in the inventory or in Chests.

## Downloadable Content
In all DLCs, the Piggyback and its contents are waterproof and will not cause sanity drain while equipped. The speed penalty is reduced from -20% to -10%.

## Tips
- This is a good replacement for the backpack until you get the Krampus Sack.
- Using a Walking Cane, roads, and other means of speed increase can mitigate or negate the speed penalty.
- In the Hamlet DLC, the speed penalty can be mitigated with the Stalking Stick.
- The Piggyback does not give the player any rain resistance, and using it in conjunction with an Umbrella will not protect the rest of the player's items from wetness.

## Trivia
- The Piggyback was added in the Doorway to Adventure update.
- The Piggyback's name is a pun, on both the fact it is a backpack made from a pig's skin and on the action of giving a piggyback.

# Grass Raft

The **Grass Raft** is a structure exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It can be created by launching a Grass Raft Kit into the **Ocean**.

## Properties

- **Health**: 200 Hull
- **Spawn Code**: `boat_grass`
- **Repaired by**: ![Cut Grass](Cut_Grass.png)
- **Perks**: Can hold multiple players.<br>Can hold structures.

Once placed, the raft constantly loses **durability** at a rate of 0.2 Hull per second. Unlike the normal **Boat**, the Grass Raft cannot be pierced, and the raft's durability can only be restored with **Cut Grass**, which restores 13 Hull. It loses 30 durability when attacked by a **Cookie Cutter** and 50 when attacked by a **Gnarwail**. Each geyser of the **Crab King** takes away 10 durability.

While moving the raft leaves behind small tufts of grass, indicating the constant destruction of the vessel. When the durability of the raft ends, it gets wet and crumbles. When completely destroyed, six tufts of grass remain on the water.

A **Captain's Tricorn**, when worn, reduces the rate of durability loss by 2 times.

# Grass Raft Kit

The **Grass Raft Kit** is a craftable item exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** introduced in **The Curse of Moon Quay** update. It can be created from the **Seafaring Filter** and is used to create a smaller version of the **Boat**.

# Manure

_Manure_ is an important resource for **Farming**. It is generated renewably by several creatures in the world, most notably **Beefalo** which make lots of it in herds for easy collection, but also including **Koalefant**s, **Pig**s, and **Splumonkey**s. It can stack up to a maximum of 20 in the **Inventory** or on the ground and does not spoil over time.

## Gathering

Manure can most easily be gathered near Beefalo herds, typically found in **Savanna** biomes. Each Beefalo (adult or baby) randomly drops Manure as they roam around the map. This can be helped by trapping the herd in a pen, but Beefalo can escape pens when in **Heat**.

| Plop Patron | Method of Contribution |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| Beefalo     | Periodically          |
| Koalefant   | Periodically          |
| Pig         | Eating Fruits or Vegetables |
| Splumonkey  | Thrown                 |
