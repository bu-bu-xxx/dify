## Usage

### Recipes

- Red Cap + Fire Pit = Cooked Red Cap
- Red Cap + Pig Icon = Manure
- 6 Red Caps + Blueprint (rare) = Red Funcap
- Red Cap + Flint + Beefalo Wool = Sunrise Spinnerbait
- Red Cap + 2 Flint = Sunrise Spoon
- Red Cap + 1 Mosquito + 10 Sanity Decrease = Sanguine Experiment (only during Hallowed Nights event)
- Red Cap + Honey + Rot = Syrup of Ipecaca (Wormwood)

### Cookbook Recipes

- Red Cap + Moon Shroom + Blue Cap + Green Cap = Mushy Cake

## Tips

- Red Caps damaging Mobs that eat it is especially useful when dealing with Gobbler
s as 3 Red Caps in a stack can kill one Gobbler, providing Drumsticks. 13 Red Caps fed to Beefalo in a row will kill it without attracting attention of the herd.
- Wormwood can eat Red Caps to gain easy Hunger, as he doesn't lose Health when eating them.

## Trivia

- The Red Cap's appearance and toxicity is likely based on the Amanita muscaria which contain a toxin that causes hallucinations and intoxication.

# Koalefant Trunk

## Description
The **Koalefant Trunk** is a **Meat** **Food** item dropped by **Koalefant**s. It can be used to craft a **Breezy Vest**. Unlike most meats, Koalefant Trunks cannot be dried on the **Drying Rack**; however, they can be fed to a bird in a **Birdcage** to produce an **Egg**. Cooking increases the Health and Hunger benefits of the Trunk as well as more than doubling the spoil time. The Koalefant Trunk can be used in the **Crock Pot** as one value of **Meat** and is a key ingredient of **Fig-Stuffed Trunk**.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "A light breezy trunk."

- **Wolfgang**: "Is floppy nose."
- ... and more.

## Winter Koalefant Trunk
The **Winter Koalefant Trunk** is a **Meat** **Food** item dropped by **Winter** Koalefants. It does the exact same benefits as a **Koalefant Trunk** when consumed. It can be used to craft a **Puffy Vest**.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "A thick, hairy trunk."
- **Willow**: "It's so soft and squishy!"
- **Wolfgang**: "Is floppy hairy nose."
- ... and more.

## Koalefant Trunk Steak
The **Koalefant Trunk Steak** is made by cooking a Koalefant Trunk or a **Winter Koalefant Trunk** over a **Campfire**, **Fire Pit**, or **Star**.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "Somehow even more nasal than before."
- **Willow**: "I'm still not sure I want to eat this."
- **Wolfgang**: "Is cooked nose."
- ... and more.

## Usage
- **Cooking**: Transforms the Koalefant Trunk into a **Koalefant Trunk Steak**.

- **Pig King**: Exchanges for a **Gold Nugget**.
- **Alchemy Engine**: Crafts a **Breezy Vest** or **Puffy Vest** depending on the type of trunk.

# Forgotten Knowledge Puzzles AKA Prototype Puzzle

![Prototype puzzle](Prototype puzzle.png)

The Forgotten Knowledge Puzzles, also known as Prototype Puzzle, were ARG puzzles similar to the William Carter Puzzles. They started on **4/30/2014**.

## Puzzles

### First Puzzle

In the [Don't Starve: Reign of Giants Expansion Release Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btI6Eyqv01c), at 0:55, frame 25 shows a board with drawings and inscriptions. Here is the screenshot:

![RoG Trailer Puzzle](RoG Trailer Puzzle.png)

It contains a link to [this site](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/craft) which leads to a site with 3 cards for entering symbols and a "Prototype" button. The page has an inscription "Find the missing things to make the thing." There's also a clickable map on the top right that takes you to [this page](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/science/craft/path.html):

![Forgotten Knowledge Screen](Forgotten Knowledge Screen.png)

![Not-crazy Coordinate](Not-crazy Coordinate.png)

A user named [WilliamGreywind](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/profile/209431-williamgreywind/) created a grid for the map, seen here:

![Not-crazy](Not-crazy.png)

![Wilson reading note](Wilson reading note.png)

The map has the inscription "Stupid Birds" and the number 17. In Don't Starve, birds sometimes brought notes resembling papyrus. Players needed to collect all 17 letters, requiring cooperation.

| Coordinate | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| 1 (-16, 16) | 7 (-4, -8) |
| 20 (-22, 1) | 60 (6,-23) |
| 2 (-22, 9) | 8 (20, -2) |
| 30 (-10,-16) | 100 (-14, 16) |
| 3 (10,-16) | 9 (2, 20) |
| 40 (16, -2) | 300 (-6, 13) |
| 4 (-11, -4) | 10 (-13, 8) |
| 50 (13, -7) | 400 (-18, 6) |
| 5 (6, 2) | |

The correct answer is **rocks 8 berries 4 silk 5**. Entering this on the first site leads to the next page:

[Next page](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/science/craft/part2.php)

### Second Puzzle

On the new page, there are two lines for entering characters and a clickable moon. A map from the previous puzzle floats on the floor:

![Forgotten Knowledge part 2](Forgotten Knowledge part 2.png)

The Antikythera mechanism is found in the page code, which is the correct answer. Entering **ANTIKYTHERA** and **MECHANISM** leads to a third site.

![Anantikythera mechanism source image](Anantikythera mechanism source image.gif)

### Third Puzzle

The third site is similar to the second, with an inscription "Not crazy. Not Crazy. Not craze. Not crazy. Not crazy. Not Crazy. Not crazy. Not crazy. Not crazy. Not Crazy. Not crazy. Not crazy. I know this all means SOMETHING! Stupid Birds. I need ALL 17!! NOT crazy."

![Full_Moon_puzzle](Full_Moon_puzzle.png)

![Don't Starve It's Greek to me.](Don't Starve It's Greek to me.JPG)

The phrase "Not crazy" is repeated, with "C" in italics on the second, sixth, and tenth repetitions. The phrase "It's Greek to me" hints that the numbers denote Greek alphabet letters. Greek letters form the constellation Gemini on the map.

![Not-crazy Сonstellation](Not-crazy Сonstellation.png)

The input panels are named "alone" and "together," alluding to the mythology of Castor and Pollux. Entering **Castor** and **Pollux** leads to the final site.

## Forgotten Knowledge

The final site is [here](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/science/craft/the_way.html). It was updated with images forming a comic that teased the game [Don't Starve Together].

## Description
Fur Tufts are Items dropped periodically by the Bearger in Don't Starve Together. Additionally, the Bearger has a 20% chance to drop three Fur Tufts each time it uses its Ground Pound attack. It is used to craft Thick Fur, or as Campfire fuel. Fur Tufts left on the ground will eventually blow away similar to Ashes.

Bearger drops 1 Fur Tuft every 45 seconds at its current location. Assuming the player follows Bearger and picks up the fur tuft it will take an hour and 10 minutes to fulfil the recipe for 3 Thick Furs. It's recommended for the player to fight Bearger for 1 Thick Fur or collect the 3 Fur Tufts from the ground attack if the player needs more than 1 Thick Fur.

## Usage
### Recipe
- Item 1: Fur Tuft (90)
- Tool: Alchemy Engine
- Result: Thick Fur (3)

## Prototype Tips
You can use a Deconstruction Staff to turn a Thick Fur into 30 Fur Tufts. If you gather 15 more Fur Tufts while fighting Bearger, you can then use a Construction Amulet to get three Thick Furs, allowing both Insulated Pack and Hibernation Vest to be achieved by second Autumn.

**Result**: Pierogi

## Tips
- Pierogi replenish as much hunger as Honey Nuggets, but heal for a substantial amount of health (40 health, 10 more than Honey Poultice). It requires Eggs from a Birdcage, which is relatively resource-intensive to craft.
- Pierogi have an exceptional spoilage time of 20 days, making them a good alternative for Honey Poultice while making long expeditions.

## Trivia
- During the Pig Fiesta event in the Hamlet DLC, Pierogi take on a more festive appearance, resembling steamed dumplings.
- In Poland, "Pierogi" is a dish similar to the Asian dumplings. The Pierogi image in the Don't Starve game files is called "perogies", but the in-game item is based on the Polish version of the dish.

The **Chicken** is an unimplemented, yet fully functional **Mob** in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It can be spawned via console using the code `"chicken"`. The Chicken is passive and drops a **Drumstick** upon death. It also has an unused animation for flying up and down similar to **Moslings**.

# Clockwork Boats

The game's data contains art assets of mobs that resemble the **Clockwork Bishop** and **Clockwork Rook**, except with boats for bodies. Their animations reveal that they were meant to use the same attacks as their land equivalents. These are similar to how the **Floaty Boaty Knight** is the **Shipwrecked** DLC's equivalent of a **Clockwork Knight**.

## Description

Trail Mix is a Fruit Food item introduced in the Reign of Giants DLC. It is cooked in a Crock Pot by combining 1 Birchnut, 1 Berry, and 1 Fruit.

## Recipe

### Crock Pot

- 1 Birchnuts
- 1 Berry
- 0.5 Fruit
- 1 Filler (Cannot be Meats, Eggs, Vegetables, and Dairy)

## Description
Honey Ham is a Meat Food item produced in Crock Pot by combining more than 1.5 units of Meats and 1 Honey. It takes 40 seconds to cook. Honey Ham is a well-rounded food providing 30 HP (as much as a Honey Poultice) and 75 Hunger.

Adding more than 1 Monster Meat will result in Monster Lasagna. Adding 1 Twig will result in Kabobs. Adding Tallbird Egg will result in Bacon and Eggs. Adding Mandrake will result in Mandrake Soup. Using 2 Leafy Meats and 2 Honey will result in Jelly Salad.

When consumed, Honey Ham raises the player's perceived temperature by 1 degree per second for 10 seconds.

# Shard

A **Shard** is a level in the game. There are two types of shards: **Surface World/Shard** and **Caves/Shard**. Shards can be connected with **Sinkholes**, which act as portals.

With custom **[Don't Starve Together](https://www.dontstarvetogether.com/)** server setups, it is possible to have one world with more than two shards. For example, you can have 1 Surface World Shard and two Caves Shards.

## Description
Glommer's Flower is an **Item** found in **Don't Starve Together**. It is obtained on the night of a **Full Moon** at **Glommer's Statue** where it will bloom, emitting light. Picking the flower will make the **Glommer** to spawn nearby.

As long as the player has the Flower in the inventory, the Glommer will follow them, much like **Chester**. Dropping the Flower on the ground or leaving it in a stationary container will cause following Glommer to stand by that location. If the Flower is put inside Chester, Glommer will start following Chester instead. When the Glommer connected to a flower dies, the Flower dies too. In this state, it can be used as fuel for **Fire Pit** or the **Ice Flingomatic**.

At the next Full Moon, another Glommer's Flower will grow at Glommer's Statue, even if the statue is destroyed.

![Fairy Glomflower](Fairy Glom - Glommer's Flower Icon.png)|Fairy Glomflower: Glommer's Flower bound with Fairy Glom. [See ingame](File:Fairy Glomflower.png)
</gallery>

## Tips
- One way to get the flower as **Woodie** is by planting a **Meat Bulb (Lureplant)** close to the statue beforehand. This can also be effective, as long as the player kills it before the plant digests the flower. The Lureplant should spit the flower out.
- Another method to get the flower as Woodie is by standing still as **Weregoose**, not fighting as **Weremoose** and not gnawing on things as **Werebeaver**, as all those factors make the Wereness Meter deplete faster.

## Trivia
- The appearance of Glommer's Flower is based on the **Rafflesia**.
- It cannot be destroyed by setting it or nearby objects on fire.

# Steam Content Collection for Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together

Through the [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) client, 'Don't Starve' and 'Don't Starve Together' players can collect various kinds of **Steam Content**, which are virtual collectibles acquired by playing the games. Steam Trading Cards are dropped randomly, and only half of a deck is obtainable through drops. Once collected, an entire deck can be crafted to earn Steam Profile Backgrounds, Steam Chat Emoticons, Coupons, and Steam XP. Once the player has reached Steam Level 10, they have a small chance to receive foil trading cards, which have no extra benefits, aside from rarity. All items that are received from crafting a badge are tradable and marketable, except coupons, which are only tradable.

See the [Official FAQ](http://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq) for more information.

Starting June 25, 2020, Steam implemented a Points Shop where players can exchange points that are accrued from purchases for Emoticons and Profile Backgrounds. Animated Stickers and Avatar Frames were also introduced. Items from the Points Shop cannot be sold or traded.[Reference](https://store.steampowered.com/points/howitworks)

| Steam Points Shop Item | Points Cost |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Emoticons             | 100         |
| Profile Backgrounds   | 500         |

**Description:**

*Wet Goop* is a **Food** item that results from invalid recipes cooked in the **Crock Pot**, left from a **Hatching Tallbird Egg** that has remained cold for too long, or hacked up by neutral **Catcoon**s. It takes 10 seconds to cook and has no effects on most characters, although it will affect **Warly** due to his refined palate.

![Bait](File:Bait.png|thumb|200px) Wet Goop used as bait for traps.

Wet Goop attracts **Pig**s who are hungry. It can be used to bait Pigs into **Tooth Trap** meat farms. Giving the item to a Pig will neither make it friendly nor cause it to produce **Manure**.

Wet Goop can also be used as bait in traps, though it will not attract most animals when used this way.

Wet Goop can be a source of **Rot** for **Fertilizers**, though there are other edibles that take less time to spoil or fewer resources to obtain.

In **Don't Starve Together**, Wet Goop is required to craft a **Terra Firma Tamper**.

If three **Twigs** are combined with anything other than **Meat**, an **Egg**, a **Dairy food**, or a **Nightmare Fuel**, the recipe will result in **Steamed Twigs**.

**Examples:**

| Item 1 | Tool | Result | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|--------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Twigs  | Crock Pot | Wet Goop | Twigs | Twigs | Monster Meat |
| Twigs  | Crock Pot | Wet Goop | Twigs | Twigs | Egg |
| Twigs  | Crock Pot | Wet Goop | Twigs | Twigs | Morsel |
| Ice    | Crock Pot | Wet Goop | Ice | Ice | Ice |

**Usage:**

| Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Count 3 | Tool | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| Wet Goop | Thulecite | Cut Stone | 3 | Blueprint (rare) | Terra Firma Tamper |

# World Customization in Don't Starve

There are a total of 47 customization options available when creating a new world in Don't Starve. These options allow players to tailor the world to their preferences. If a player uses the Wooden Thing (Teleportato) to create a new world, any changes to the customization are retained. Note that setting many options concerning spawn rates above the "default" value can cause resources to spawn outside their native biomes.

## Available Options

The options are listed below in the order they appear in the World Settings screen:

| Type           | Icon                                                                 | Content                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| World Size    | ![World Size Settings Icon](https://example.com/World_Size_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the size of the world. This does not increase the number of biomes; it just makes individual biomes larger. Available options are default, medium, large, and huge. |
| Land Branching | ![Land Branch Settings Icon](https://example.com/Land_Branch_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the degree to which the land will branch off and be connected by bridging pieces. Available options are least, default, and most. |
| Land Looping   | ![Land Loop Settings Icon](https://example.com/Land_Loop_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the degree to which Roads will tend to lead you in circles and the degree to which the land will curve. Available options are none, default, and always. |
| Length of Seasons | ![Seasons Settings Icon](https://example.com/Seasons_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the length of Summer and Winter. Available options are only Summer, only Winter, default, long Summer, long Winter, long both, and short both. |
| Starting Season | ![Season Start Settings Icon](https://example.com/Season_Start_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the starting season. Available options are Summer and Winter. |
| Length of Day  | ![Day Settings Icon](https://example.com/Day_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the length and/or presence/absence of Day, Dusk, and Night. Available options are only Day, only Dusk, only Night, default, long Day, long Dusk, and long Night. |
| Weather       | ![Weather Settings Icon](https://example.com/Weather_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the frequency of weather events. Setting weather to lots (infinite) on world presets will also set infinite snow during winter. Available options are none, less, default, more, and lots. |
| Lightning     | ![Lightning Settings Icon](https://example.com/Lightning_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the frequency of lightning strikes. Available options are none, less, default, more, and lots. |
| Sinkholes     | ![Sinkhole Settings Icon](https://example.com/Sinkhole_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines whether Sinkholes are generated. Available options are yes or no. |
| Touch Stones | ![Touch Stone Settings Icon](https://example.com/Touch_Stone_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the amount of naturally spawning Touchstones. Available options are none, less, default, more, and lots. |
| Boons         | ![Set Pieces Settings Icon](https://example.com/Set_Pieces_Settings_Icon.png) | Determines the amount of naturally spawning Set Pieces. Available options are none, less, default, more, and lots. |
| ...           | ...                                                                  | ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Additional information concerning specific consequences of the customization options:
- A long season lasts ~50 days.
- A short season lasts ~10 days.
- A long day is 14 daylight hours, 1 dusk hour, and 1 night hour of the clock.
- A long dusk is 7 daylight hours, 6 dusk hours, and 3 night hours of the clock.
- A long night is 5 daylight hours, 2 dusk hours, and 9 night hours of the clock.
- Resources, animals, and foods set to lots will spawn in every biome, with the exception of plants in Rockyland.
- Rain set to lots is infinite.
- When Lightning is set to more, lightning will also strike when it is snowing.
- When Lightning is set to lots, lightning will strike every 10–30 seconds.
- Setting objects to none will not prevent them from spawning in Set Pieces, such as Trees around Maxwell's Door.

- **Wolfgang:** "Is very special antler!"

- **Choose:** Wigfrid

The **Stag Antler** is an **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It is dropped by **Klaus** when he's killed, and is used to open the **Loot Stash**. It serves no other purpose.

The Stag Antler cannot be put inside **Bundling Wrap** or **Winter's Feast|Gift Wrap**.

## Trivia
- The Stag Antler was introduced in the **Winter's Feast** update, alongside the **Event** of the same name.
- Though the antler comes from Klaus, it bears no resemblance to the ones on Klaus' head. The one on his head are curved inward in one large tusk either red and white or dark brown, while the Stag Antler is stretched into several nooks and crannies (resembling a caribou antler) and is colored bone-white.

- **Winona:** Let's build a bee house.
- **Walter:** Just don't use it to comb your hair.
- **Wanda:** It's much better once you pick out the bees.

## Description
Honeycombs are acquired by destroying Bee Hives and Killer Bee Hives, unless burned down, which yields Ashes.

## Usage
Honeycombs are mainly used to build Bee Boxes and craft Beeswax, but can also be used in Taffy, Pumpkin Cookie, and Ice Cream recipes as a substitute for Honey or as a neutral filler in any other Crock Pot recipes. However, Honeycomb itself cannot be eaten.

The ideal time to get it from Bee Hives is right before Dusk when most or all bees are outside collecting pollen. The only ones that defend the hive are still inside until the player fights back, and one or two bees can be safely ignored with protective gear. Since Killer Bees don't leave their nest to collect pollen, there is no opportune time to attack a Killer Bee Hive, except for leading other mobs like Deerclops into them, to access its honeycomb.

Another option is luring them away by proceeding to run in large circles to keep them a fair distance. Since they are far slower than the player it becomes an easy task (even more so if there is a Road surrounding the nest). Then run back, destroy the hive and take the prize.

The Gigantic Beehive has a very small chance to drop a Honeycomb every time the player hammers it. The Bee Queen also drops 1-2 Honeycombs upon death, and her Bee Queen Crown also drops 4 Honeycombs when deconstructed.

## Recipes

### Bee Box
- **Ingredients:**
  - Honeycomb
  - Boards × 2
  - Bee × 4
- **Tool:** Science Machine
- **Result:** Bee Box

### Beeswax
- **Ingredients:**
  - Honeycomb

# Night Hand

### Structure Infobox
- **Name**: Night Hand
- **Image**:
  ![Hand](Hand%20in%20loop%2090s%20000.png)
  ![Arm](Arm%20loop%2090s%20000.png)
- **Walk Speed**: 2
- **Sanity Aura**: -40 (hand)
- **Spawn Code**: "shadowhand", "shadowhand_arm"

The **Night Hand** is a Shadow Creature that extends from the darkness in an attempt to extinguish the player's fire. It is always accompanied by the sound of a creepy music box. Up to 3 Night Hands can spawn at the same time.

### Abilities and Tactics
- A Night Hand will reduce the strength (or intensity) of a fire by 50%. The more hands that appear, the less damage they can do to a fire (1 Hand = <60% per hand. 3 Hands = <30% per hand).
- Night Hands have a **Sanity** aura of -40/min.
- When stepped on, a Night Hand will retract back into the darkness for a few seconds, after which it will make another attempt to extinguish the fire.
- If the player chases a Night Hand far enough into total darkness, it will permanently disappear.

A potential tactic is to max the fire and stand near to max it out again after the attack, although this burns quite a few resources and does not get rid of the Night Hands. A second fire nearby, or a **Miner Hat**, "cancels" Night Hands altogether for the night. Placing **Fireflies** around the fire can completely prevent Night Hands from ever showing up.

If the player stokes their fire after the Night Hand appears, it is possible to see the "end" of the night hand. Forcing the Night Hand to retract until its wrist is touching its end will "kill" the Night Hand.

The Night Hand can be destroyed if a light source becomes bright enough, such as if a Night Hand appears when a fire is low and it is immediately stoked to full, or if the player puts on a pair of **Moggles**.

### Trivia
#### In-Game
- It is possible for a lightning strike to extinguish the Night Hand just as it spawns.
- In **Don't Starve Together**, **Ghost Characters** can assist living players at night by chasing away Night Hands.
- The smoke emitted by the **Shadow Thurible** and Tragic **Torch** skin in DST sometimes takes the shape of a Crawling Horror, a Terrorbeak, or a Shadow Hand.

#### Lore
- Shadow Creatures make several appearances throughout the **William Carter Puzzles**.
  - A Terrorbeak, a Crawling Horror, and a Night Hand appear in the source code of the eighth puzzle.
  - Mr. Skitts and a Terrorbeak appear briefly in an intermission animation in the eighth puzzle.
- Multiple instances of Shadow Hands and Terrorbeaks appear to be terrorizing **Wanda** throughout the animated short **Long Shadows**.

### Bugs
- The music associated with a Night Hand will continue to play indefinitely sometimes. This can be resolved by save/quitting, then reloading the game.
- A Night Hand can still extinguish a fire even after the player has triggered its retreating animation by stepping on it.
- A Night Hand may appear even when Sanity is more than half full.
- A Night Hand may appear in the Ocean. If this occurs in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC when the Night Hand is targeting a land-based fire, the Hand will be stopped by the land border and be unable to extinguish the fire, and will be stuck until day arrives.

- **Wortox:** "I'll have to settle for these scraps of metal."
- **Wormwood:** "Robot buildy bits?"

**Scrap** is an **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**. It can be obtained by rummaging through **Junk Piles** or destroying **Junky Fences** with a 25% chance. After **Lunar Rifts** are activated, it can also be obtained by hammering **Abandoned Junk** which appear in **Junk Yards** (if **Scrappy Werepig** is not alive).

**Scrap** is used to craft and upgrade the **Lunar Siphonator**. After the activation of **Lunar Rifts**, it can be used to craft the **Auto-Mat-O-Chanic**, **W.A.R.B.I.S. Head Gear**, and **W.A.R.B.I.S. Armor** after learning the corresponding rare **Blueprints** which dropped from **Abandoned Junk** and **Scrappy Werepig**.

Like **Gears**, repairing **Broken Clockworks** in the **Ruins** with 3 Scraps will spawn a friendly damaged chess monster (**Damaged Bishop**, **Damaged Knight**, or **Damaged Rook**).
