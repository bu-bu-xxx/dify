A **Light Bulb** is a **Food Item** obtained by harvesting a **Light Flower** or as a drop from a **Slurper** or **Big Tentacle**.

While technically a Food item (restoring 1 **Health** each), Light Bulbs are mainly used for other purposes. They can be used to craft the **Lantern** or as fuel for **Miner Hat**s and **Lantern**s (extending durability by ~19.2% or 1.5 minutes per Light Bulb).

Light Bulbs can be placed on the ground to be used as a **Light** source and will prevent an attack from **Charlie**.

Since Light Flowers regrow every 3 days, Light Bulbs are fully renewable, meaning an unlimited supply of fuel for Lanterns and Miner Hats.

## Downloadable Content
In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, Light Bulbs can be obtained by killing **Glowflies** and **Rabid Beetle**s.

## Usage
### Crafting Manure
- **Tool**: Pig Icon
- **Result**: Manure
- **Item**: Light Bulb

### Crafting Lantern
- **Item 1**: Light Bulb (2)
- **Item 2**: Rope (2)
- **Item 3**: Twigs (3)
- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine
- **Result**: Lantern

## Tips
- Light Bulbs spoil quickly, so it may be wise to place them inside a **Bundling Wrap** to preserve them indefinitely.
  - Alternatively, one can keep multiple lanterns in a chest, and refuel them all at once to have a longer-lasting supply of light.
  - They are also a good source of **Rot** considering they grow back relatively fast and are only mainly used for refueling light sources.

## Trivia
- The name Light Bulb is based on its appearance (being a plant bulb) and real-life light bulbs.

## Scrapbook Info

- **Creates light when held.**
- **Does electrical damage which does more damage to wet targets.**

## Tips

- **Striking an uncharged Volt Goat with the Morning Star will charge it.** This can be useful if the player is hunting for Electric Milk.
- **Due to the wetness modifier, this weapon is most useful during Spring,** due to the abundance of rain.
- **During Spring, the Morning Star can prove very useful in the Caves and Ruins** as it provides light and does a high amount of damage.
- **In Don't Starve Together,** the following enemies are permanently wet, making the Morning Star the strongest melee weapon against them regardless of weather:
  - Depths Worms;
  - All varieties of Tentacles;
  - Merms.

## Trivia

- **In the real world, morning stars are medieval spiked clubs resembling maces.**
- **The Morning Star's base damage is 28.9,** but since it is electrical, it gains a 1.5x modifier, bringing it to 43.35 damage. Additionally, if the target the player is attacking is wet (has a Wetness prefix), there will be an additional 1x modifier for a total of 2.5x. This means that the Morning Star can do either 43.35 or 72.25 damage (

## Lighter Skills

### Brighter Lighter

If Willow has [[Willow/Don't_Starve_Together#Brighter Lighter|Brighter Lighter]] skill, the light radius of **Willow's Lighter** will increase to 1.5 tiles (level I) and 2.5 tiles (level II).

### Hungry Lighter

Willow with [[Willow/Don't_Starve_Together#Hungry Lighter|Hungry Lighter]] skill will be able to use **Willow's Lighter** to absorb fire. While equipped in the Hand slot, right-clicking Willow's Lighter will cause her to channel an endothermic reaction through it, extinguishing all fires within a 0.625 tile radius. This effect can be channeled, enabling Willow to continue moving as she absorbs surrounding fire.

### Ember Tender

When Willow has [[Willow/Don't_Starve_Together#Ember Tender|Ember Tender]] skill, ignited creatures that die within 10 tiles of Willow will drop [[Ethereal Ember]]s, the amount depending on their size, which can be absorbed into Willow's inventory using her Lighter and used to either refuel it or cast various fire spells.

It also Unlocks the spell [[Ethereal Ember#Flame Cast|Flame Cast]], which costs 1 Ember: Willow selects a point within 2 tiles of her, igniting everything within a 0.375 tile radius of the point on fire. Entities ignited by this spell take 2x fire damage than normal.

# Night Armor

## Overview

- **Image**: ![Night Armor](Night_Armor.png)
- **Dropped Image**: ![Night Armor Dropped](Night_Armor_Dropped.png)
- **Scrapbook Description**: This armor blocks damage, but has a nasty habit of driving its wearer insane.
- **Tier**: 3
- **Filter**: ![Armor Filter](Pic32_Armor_Filter.png) ![Magic Filter](Pic32_Magic_Filter.png)
- **Ingredients**:
  - Nightmare Fuel: 5
  - Papyrus: 3
- **Durability**: 525 hp
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Perk**: Decreases sanity by 10% of total damage taken.
- **Sanity Drain**: -10/min
- **Spawn Code**: "armor_sanity"
- **Description**: Protects your body, but not your mind.

## Drops

- Ancient Pseudoscience Station (Hammer)
- Level 3 Shadow Knight
- Level 3 Shadow Bishop
- Level 3 Shadow Rook

## Protection

- 95%

## Skins

- **Woven - Elegant Corrupted Cloak**: Introduced during the official Year of the Carrat event in 2020.
  - ![Corrupted Cloak Icon](Corrupted_Cloak_Icon.png)
  - **Description**: Black suits you.
  - ![See ingame](Corrupted_Cloak_Wilson.png)
- **Woven - Elegant Cursed Cloak**: Dark Wizard Collection
  - ![Cursed Cloak Icon](Cursed_Cloak_Icon.png)
  - **Description**: This cloak clings to you like your own shadow.
  - ![See ingame](Cursed_Cloak_Wilson.png)
- **Woven - Elegant Shadowy Armor**:
  - ![Shadowy Armor Icon](Shadowy_Armor_Icon.png)
  - **Description**: The darkness will protect you.
  - ![See ingame](Shadowy_Armor_Wilson.png)

## Tips

- It is useful to also equip a head-slot item which can boost sanity, such as the Tam o' Shanter, helping to offset the sanity drain while still having very high physical protection.
- The Night Armor is especially useful on Wanda in her old form, nullifying the sanity drain, and allowing her to benefit from the bonus damage on shadow weapons, while staying more safe.
- In Don't Starve Together, as of the Encore update, the Night Armor (along with the Dark Sword) do not apply a sanity drain on Maxwell. Considering his frailty and the ease of which he is able to farm Nightmare Fuel, the Night Armor is a good option for protecting him.

## Trivia

- The Night Armor was added in the Insanity! update.
- When paired with the Shelmet or the Thulecite Crown, the player is able to absorb 99.5% of incoming damage (doesn't apply to Don't Starve Together), enough to survive a Gunpowder explosion, losing 1 Hp and 20 Sanity.
- Wickerbottom states the armor transfers the damage into another dimension.
- The Night Armor makes a "warping" noise when the player moves while wearing it.

- The Winter Hat used to cost 100 points under the old **Research Points** system. Adding it into a Science Machine or Alchemy Engine would give the player 10 points.
- **Klei Entertainment** made a [product](https://shop.klei.com/product/dont-starve-winter-hat-replica-blue/) themed after the winter hat. It also comes in [dark grey](https://shop.klei.com/product/dont-starve-winter-hat-replica/) and two versions of pink: [one](https://shop.klei.com/product/dont-starve-winter-hat-klei-logo-version-2-0-pink/) has a Klei logo, while the [other](https://shop.klei.com/product/dont-starve-pink-winter-hat-replica/) has a **Don't Starve** logo. They all include codes to unlock the corresponding colored Winter Hat **Skins** in **Don't Starve Together**.
- In Rhymes with Play Ep. 53, artist Kelly Graham stated that the hat's design is based on her father's hat from the 70s which she found in the basement.[Rhymes with Play Ep. 53 (14:14)](https://youtu.be/AHRN7cDZqbk?t=854)

## Scrapbook Info

While in the Cave, it reveals the state of dark magic saturation.

## Description

The Thulecite Medallion is an Ancient item. It requires 2 Nightmare Fuel, 2 Thulecite, and a Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, the Thulecite Medallion cannot be prototyped and Characters need to be near a Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft it again.

The medallion changes colors to gauge the state of the Nightmare Cycle in the Ruins:

- Calm Phase - The medallion will be tan.
- Warning Phase - The medallion will be tan with red accents.
- Nightmare Phase - The medallion will glow red. Nightmare Lights will spawn Shadow Creatures in this phase.

Examining the item at this time will provide further details regarding the current state of magical flux: "becoming more magical", "staying steady", or "becoming less magical", referring to the start, middle, and end of the Nightmare Phase, respectively.

When outside the Ruins (including in the Caves), it will remain a constant red, with the character noting it's not working when it's examined.

![All stages of a Thulecite Medallion](Thulecite_medallion_allstages.png)

Thulecite Medallions can spawn at Cave Holes which can be gathered using The Lazy Forager.

When a Thulecite Medallion is in the inventory of a player, the Ancient Key will appear on their map, even if it is carried by another Mob or player, in a container or on the ground and in an unexplored area.

## Usage

Recipe:

| Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Result | Character |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Thulecite Medallion | Papyrus | Feather Pencil | Bel Canto of Courage | Wigfrid |

## Tips

Using a Thulecite Medallion in Don’t Starve Together is an excellent way to find the Ancient Guardian (if it has not been found/killed yet), as it holds the Ancient Key. It is also a good way to locate the key when the player carrying it has travelled off somewhere too far and can't be found.

# Poison Birchnut Tree

## Overview
The Poison Birchnut Tree is a type of tree in the game **Don't Starve** that can become aggressive when certain conditions are met. Here is a structured summary of its characteristics and behaviors:

### Structure Infobox
- **Tool**: Can be Chopped with an Axe or Dug with a Shovel (when Sapling or Stump)
- **Name**: Poison Birchnut Tree
- **Image**: ![Poison Birchnut Tree](File:Poison Birchnut Tree.png)
- **Image Width**: 150px
- **Health**: 12 chops
- **Damage**: 30
- **Attack Period**: 1.5 seconds
- **Attack Range**: 2 units
- **Walk Speed**: Immobile
- **Spawns**: ![Birchnutter](pic24|Birchnutter)
- **Drops**: 3x Birchnut, 1-2x Living Log, Nightmare Fuel (20% chance)

### Exclusivity
- **Reign of Giants | Don't Starve Together**

### Quotes
- **Wilson**: It looks unhappy about me stealing those birchnuts!
- **Willow**: A fire would set him straight.
- **Wolfgang**: Is big and angry tree.
- **Wendy**: Extra-spooky!
- **WX-78**: THE MONSTER WITHIN REARS ITS HEAD
- **Wickerbottom**: That is no tree I've seen before!
- **Woodie**: You're due for a chopping.
- **Maxwell**: Shut your maw!
- **Wagmaff**: Fantastic! I wonder what has possessed it.
- **Wigfrid**: I've göt tö wörk a bit harder för this firewööd.
- **Webber**: What're you so mad about?
- **Walani**: I said I was sorry!
- **Warly**: No thank you!
- **Woodlegs**: Ye don't seem very nice.
- **Warbucks**: I say! That tree has acquired an eyeball!
- **Wilba**: 'TIS EYEBALL TREE!
- **Wormwood**: Friend?
- **Wheeler**: Swell. Even the trees are alive.
- **Winona**: Why does a tree need a mouth?!
- **Wortox**: It is no longer bound to the earth!
- **Wurt**: What you looking at, florp?
- **Walter**: Woah! I've never seen a tree with teeth before!
- **Wanda**: Mind your own business, you pesky tree!
- **Choose**: Wolfgang

### Behaviors
- When cutting down a fully sized Birchnut Tree that drops Birchnuts from day 3 and after, there is a small chance that other Birchnut Trees in the area will "awaken" and begin attacking anything in the area, unless it is Winter. This chance increases with the number of days survived from 3% on day 3 to 33% on day 70. After enough time passes (minimum one day), Poison Birchnut Trees will calm down and return to their normal state. The player can also plant Birchnuts nearby to attempt to pacify them.

- A Poison Birchnut Tree can spawn up to 5 Birchnutters to attack the player or nearby Mobs. They will also do a root attack, behaving similarly to tentacles, that will attempt to home in on the player's position.

- Unlike the somewhat similar Treeguards, Poison Birchnut Trees have to be felled with an Axe (12 chops) or any other method that will destroy the average tree. Torching a Poison Birchnut Tree spawns another, final wave of Birchnutters.

- A Poison Birchnut Tree will drop 1 Living Log and 3 Birchnuts and has a 20% chance to drop an additional Living Log or Nightmare Fuel. Its stump can also be dug up to yield an additional Living Log.

### Downloadable Content
To get more Birchnuts, the player has to kill Poison Birchnut Trees and Birchnutters, travel to a Reign of Giants world by Seaworthy or Skyworthy, or buy them in the Miss Sow's Floral Arrangements shop.

### Tips
- It is advised to bring a group of befriended Pigs when chopping Birchnut Trees. As soon as a Poison Birchnut Tree is spawned, the allied Pigs will attempt to chop it down as well as fight the Birchnutters.
- If left for a while (but not too long), Poison Birchnut Trees will stop attacking and spawning Birchnutters, making them safer to chop down.
- Mobs like the Bearger and Clockwork Rook will cut

- Wanda: Oh botheration, I thought it was a compass.

## Scrapbook Info

- Launches a tornado that moves around randomly damaging creatures and breaking structures.

The Weather Pain is a ranged Weapon from the Reign of Giants DLC. It requires 10 Down Feathers, 1 Volt Goat Horn, and 1 Gears to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. When used, it launches a whirlwind toward the target which will dance back and forth near the point of impact once it reaches the target, damaging enemies and destroying objects it comes in contact with.

## Skins

![Feather Vane](Feather Vane Icon.png) Woven - Elegant Feather Vane: "Give your attacks a murderous twist!"

## Tips

- Due to the somewhat unpredictable behavior of its projectile, the Weather Pain is best used against slow or immobile targets that spawn weaker mobs to defend them, e.g., Big Tentacles, Poison Birchnut Trees, or Spider Queens. This is especially effective against Poisonous Birchnut Trees, which will die in one hit, making the Weather Pain an ideal tool for acquiring Living Logs.
- Against particularly slow Mobs or even immobile ones, the Weather Pain can do more than 100 damage with a single use, surpassing even Blow Darts, making it potentially the best ranged weapon—depending on the target.
- The Weather Pain's projectile destroys trees, which can make it useful for gathering Logs, especially if the trees are planted close together. This will often happen inadvertently in a Poison Birch farm.
- By using a Construction Amulet to make one using 5 feathers, and then using a Deconstruction Staff to get ten feathers back, the Weather Pain can be renewed easily in late game as long as the player doesn't use all its charges before deconstructing it.
- The Weather Pain is handy against certain Boss Mobs such as the Toadstool's Sporecaps and Ancient Fuelweaver's Woven Shadows.

## Trivia

- The name "Weather Pain" is a portmanteau of the words "Weather Vane" and "Pain".
- Weather pains in real life are joint pains induced by atmospheric pressure changes.
- A Shadow Creature that is able to be seen but not yet aggressive towards the players can be aggroed indirectly with the Weather Pain. This can be achieved by using it on some structure or creature which is on the other side of the Shadow Creature. When the projectile is launched, it is able to interact with the Shadow Creature before hitting the other target. This causes it to be aggressive towards the player for a short time.

The **Volcano Staff** is a **Volcanic** **Item** introduced in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It requires 1 **Fire Staff**, 4 **Obsidian**, and 1 **Dragoon Heart** to craft. It can also occasionally be found in **X Marks the Spot** Treasure Chests, has a 50% chance of being found in the **Chest of the Depths** dropped by the **Quacken** and by the bodies failed survivors. with 3-5 uses. Additionally, the staff can be found as **Set Piece** with the staff in the middle and 6 **Obsidian** forming a circle around it. When the staff is picked up from the Set Piece, even by a **Prime Ape**, the Volcano immediately erupts and **Dragoon Eggs** rain from the sky. Like all items in the **Volcanic Tab**, it cannot be prototyped and the player must be wearing a **Brain of Thought** or be near an **Obsidian Workbench** to craft it again.

When used, it rains down **Dragoon Eggs** where the spell was cast. There is a small chance for some of the **Dragoon Eggs** to stay intact, and **Lava Pools** will also form. When the player is on land, the **Volcano Staff** can only be targeted on land terrain. If cast close to the ocean, dragoon eggs may fall in the ocean and create **Waves**. When the player's on boat, it can only be targeted on sea terrain.

![The Set Piece - picking up the Volcano Staff will start a Volcano eruption.](Volcano_Staff_Trap.png)

When the **Volcano Staff** is brought to a base game, **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** or **Don't Starve: Hamlet** world via the **Seaworthy** or **Skyworthy** and used there, it will fail to activate and nothing will happen, accompanied by the player's character saying that it will not work there.

### Prototype Tips
- When cast on a dead **Whale**, each **Dragoon Egg** that hits the carcass will advance the bloating stage by 1.
- The **Volcano Staff** can be used on a herd of **Water Beefalo** when they are grouped together at dusk and night. Surrounding **Mangrove Trees** will be harvested if hit but will otherwise regrow. This method is better than using **Boat Cannon**, **Coconade**, or **Obsidian Coconade** since there is less chance of spreading fire and burning down the biome. Be aware that **Croco

- Wolfgang: Haha! Now big scary teeth belong to Wolfgang!
- Wendy: Nothing can truly shield you from the horrors of this cruel world.

- Woodie: Hmm, metal teeth would sure be handy fer choppin'...
- Maxwell: At least dealing with that monstrosity was good for something.
- Wigfrid: Why cower behind a shield when you can strike with it!

## Description
The **Shield of Terror** is a **Weapon** and wearable hand slot **Armor** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in the **An Eye for An Eye** update. It is dropped from **Twins of Terror** upon their death.

- **Durability**: 315
- **Absorbs**: 80% of all physical damage
- **Durability Loss on Attack**: 2
- **Repair Method**: Feeding it any food item
  - Repair Amount Formula: (food's health * 4) + (food's Hunger * 1.75)
  - Example: A piece of **Meat** can repair it by ~47.8 durability (~15 percent), while a piece of **Monster Meat** can repair it by ~112.8 durability (35.8 percent)

## Tips
- If a player gives the Shield of Terror any **glow-related food** it will glow without the need to wear a light-related item. This can be used to avoid the sanity cost of eating a Glow Berry.
- Since durability restoration isn't hurt by negative food values, it can be efficiently repaired with otherwise harmful food such as **Monster Meat** or even **Rot**.

## Trivia
- The Shield of Terror was introduced in the **An Eye for an Eye** update, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's **Terraria**.
- The Shield of Terror is a reference to the Shield of Cthulhu item from **Terraria**.
  - The Shield of Cthulhu, however, drops as an Expert Mode/Master Mode item from the Eye of Cthulhu, not The Twins.
  - The Shield of Cthulhu in **Terraria** does increase defense. Additionally, it grants the ability to dash a short distance.
- When fed while the item is placed on the ground it plays a little animation.
- If given any glow related foodstuff, it will glow without the need to wear a light related item, which makes it viable for caving or fighting in the night. It's also viable when playing as Wigfrid, as she's unable to consume glow foods.
- Feeding the Shield of Terror with Warly's spices and jelly will not give it buffs.

## Overview
Nettle Rolls are a Crock Pot dish introduced in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. They require at least 3 Nettles to cook, and a filler, which cannot be a Mandrake. Adding Vegetables as filler may result in Ratatouille, while adding Fruits as filler may result in Fist Full of Jam.

Nettle Rolls temporarily alleviate Hay Fever without the need of a Gas Mask for 720 seconds (or one and a half game-days). When eaten, they restore 20 Health, 25 Hunger and 5 Sanity.

## Prerequisites
- Requires: Nettle
- Excludes: Mandrake

## Recipe
| Item  | Count |
|-------|-------|
| Nettle | 3     |
| Filler | 1     |

## Examples
| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Nettle  | 3     |
| Twigs   | 1     |
| Result  | Nettle Rolls |

| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Nettle  | 3     |
| Radishes| 1     |
| Result  | Nettle Rolls (50% Chance of cooking Ratatouille) |

| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Nettle  | 3     |
| Berry   | 1     |
| Result  | Nettle Rolls (50% Chance of cooking Fist Full of Jam) |

## Prototype Tips
- Wigfrid is unable to eat Nettles or Nettle Rolls, so the player will need to rely on Meated Nettles or have a Gas Mask prepared before the Lush Season begins to avoid Hay Fever.
- The player will need to amass 24 raw Nettles to sustain each Lush Season.
- The player should keep in mind that Nettle Rolls alleviates Hay Fever for 120 seconds longer than its raw counterpart (3 raw Nettles alleviate hay fever for 600 seconds total) and restores a tiny bit of sanity. However, Nettle Rolls spoil, heal 10 hp less, and fills 5 less hunger than its 3 raw counterparts.
  - Alternatively, the player can use the insulated pack's ability to slow food spoilage to carry around all the Nettle Rolls they will need for the season around with them. Assuming the player cooks them all at the start of the season, only two or three will become stale before the hay fever ends. The player will need seven or eight Nettle Rolls to get through the season, depending on how much they plan to utilize the Gas Mask.

## Trivia
During the Pig Fiesta event, Nettle Rolls take on a more festive appearance.

Spawns in **Cave Pond** and **Pond** and can be fished using a **Fishing Rod**. An Eel can be dried on a **Drying Rack** to produce **Small Jerky**. It can also replace **Fish** as a prerequisite in **Crock Pot** recipes.

Trading one Eel with the **Pig King** will yield five **Gold Nuggets**, while all other meat items yield one nugget. Eels can be used for obtaining a large amount of gold in a relatively short amount of time via the Pig King, although by the time the player receives a large amount of Eels, they would have almost no need for gold requiring items.

However, the ability to make **Surf 'n' Turf** while exploring the ruins can keep you fed and sane indefinitely.

## Scrapbook Info
Can be used to block attacks. Successfully blocking an attack decreases the block cooldown. It can only be equipped by Wigfrids who have the "Battle Rönd" skill.

## Description
The Battle Rönd is a character-specific craftable **Weapon** and wearable hand slot **Armor** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It can only be crafted and equipped by **Wigfrid** after unlocking the **Battle Rönd** Skill and requires 4 **Gold Nuggets** and 3 **Beefalo Wool** to craft.

It has a durability of 420 HP and absorbs 85% of all physical **Damage**. Despite it appearing as a shield, it is equipped like a usual weapon in the hand slot. Additionally, although it uses the default unarmed attack animation, it is "swung" as fast as a **Spear**. When used as a weapon, it loses 3 HP of durability each attack, dealing 63.8 damage to its target (its base damage is 51, Wigfrid has an innate +25% damage modifier), which is the same as Wigfrid using a **Tentacle Spike**.

The Rönd has a special ability to parry, which is performed with a right click by default. When right clicking, the prompt to block comes up while generating a cone-shaped directional guide, indicating where it must be aimed. Successfully blocking attacks from the direction it comes from will absorb 100% of incoming physical and **Planar Damage**, while losing no durability; facing the wrong direction will result in damage and durability loss as usual. The blocking lasts 1 second, or 2.5 seconds if the **Battle Rönd Enhancement I** Skill is unlocked.

This ability has a cooldown. Whenever the Rönd is equipped, its cooldown to be used the first time is 2 seconds.

After use, the ability has one of two cooldowns: after successfully parrying an attack, the cooldown is 3 seconds. If no attack was parried, either by being hit from the unprotected direction or the parry timer running out, the cooldown is 10 seconds.

If the **Battle Rönd Enhancement II** Skill is unlocked, the next attack Wigfrid makes after parrying deals +15 to

## Scrapbook Info
Things can be stored in Hutch much like a treasure chest.

## Hutch (Short for Hutch Danglefish, P.I.)
Hutch is a following companion exclusive to the [[Caves]] of ''[[Don't Starve Together]]''. Players can store up to nine stacks of [[Item]]s inside him. He functions similarly to [[Chester]] and has almost identical stats, including a regeneration of 22.5 [[Health]] every 3 seconds, designed to regenerate its full life in a minute (2 segments). Similar to Chester and the [[Eye Bone]], he is summoned with and will follow [[Star-Sky]].

Similar to Chester and [[Packim Baggims]], Hutch can transform depending on his current inventory. Unlike other portable inventory followers, Hutch does not consume the materials on transformation. He will also emit light if one or more [[Light Bulb]]s, [[Bulbous Lightbug]], [[Glow Berries]] or [[Festive Lights]] are stored within him. These Light Bulbs will not be consumed and will spoil at their normal rate. Hutch will not leave the caves to go to the surface, and will instead wait for you in the caves where you left him.

As long as [[Webber]] is the one carrying Star-Sky, spiders will not attack Hutch. This does not apply to the [[Spider Queen]], or the spiders spawned by her.

## Mob Infobox: Fugu Hutch

Fugu Hutch is a special version of Hutch. If both an item that can make Hutch emit light and a [[Spear]], [[Battle Spear]], [[Strident Trident]] or [[Glass Cutter]] are stored inside him, Hutch will turn into Fugu Hutch. In this state, anything that attacks Hutch receives 30 damage. Hutch will remain in this form until the Spear/Light loses all durability or is removed.

## Shadow Rift Content
If it gets caught in the [[Acid Rain]] its damage attack will rises to +50%, move speed will rises to +15% and taking damage decreases by -25%. The fact that it is subject to the effect can be understood by the special breath that he will emit.

The **Rain Hat** is a craftable **Dress** item from the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC. It requires 2 **Moleworms**, 1 **Straw Hat**, and 1 **Bone Shard** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. The **Sewing Kit** repairs 50% of its durability.

## Description
When worn during **Rain**, it protects against **Wetness** gain by 70%. Additionally, it insulates the player against **Lightning** strikes and the electric shocks of a charged **Volt Goat**.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Reign of Giants** (ROG) DLC, if a player tracks a **Varg**, the Varg can spot the player and howl, calling two Hounds to help attack the player. Depending on the season, these Hounds can be normal, Blue, and Red.

## Periodic Hound Attacks

When a Hound attack is imminent, snorting and growling sounds will be heard. These sounds start off softly and grow louder as the Hounds approach. Characters will also call attention to these sounds with phrases such as, "Did you hear that?". Usually, these warnings appear at least twice before the Hounds come.

### Attack Frequency

- **Day 1 to 20**: 3 to 8 seconds
- **Day 21 to 60**: 2 to 5 seconds
- **Day 61 to 100**: 0.5 to 3.5 seconds
- **Day 101 or more**: 0.5 to 1.5 seconds

### Special Hound Spawn Chance

- **Day 1 to 16**: 0%
- **Day 17 to 31**: 10%
- **Day 32 to 51**: 20%
- **Day 52 to 76**: 33.3%
- **Day 77 or more**: 50%

### World Customization

Hound attack frequency can be configured in **World Customization**.

## Behavior

Hounds are naturally aggressive but easily distracted. They will attack all creatures on sight and immediately charge the player when they spawn during a Hound attack. After a while, they can become distracted by nearby Mobs or Meat.

## Fighting Strategy

Hounds are much faster than the player and cannot be outrun unless they become distracted or belong to a Hound Mound. The player can use a **Walking Cane** or run along a **Road** to outrun them.

### Tips

- While Hounds are attacking, **Chester** can and will be targeted.
- 2 or 3 Hounds can usually be defeated without issue




# Nightmare Fuel

## Overview

![Nightmare Fuel Dropped](Nightmare Fuel Dropped.png)

Nightmare Fuel is a **Refined** **Item** used in the ways of **Dark** and **Ancient** **Magic**. It requires a **Prestihatitator** to prototype and costs 4 **Dark Petals** to craft. It can also be obtained as a drop from various mobs and objects.

## Crafting

### Normal Craft

- **Dark Petals** x4

### Craft by Skill

- **Pure Horror** x2 (for **Wilson**)

## Description

### Normal Craft

"Evil residue used by the foolish and crazy."

### Craft by Skill

"Transmute Pure Horror into Nightmare Fuel."

## Gathering

Nightmare Fuel can be gathered through various methods, such as killing **Crawling Horrors**, **Terrorbeaks**, and **Reanimated Skeletons**, or by farming **Evil Flowers**. It can also be obtained by hammering **Pig Head**s and **Merm Head**s during a **Full Moon**.

## Drop Table

| Source | Quantity | Chance |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Crab Beardling | 1-3 | 40% |
| Shadow Splumonkey | 1 | 50% |
| Damaged Knight, Damaged Bishop, Damaged Rook | 1 | 60% |
| Grave + Shovel | 1 | 3.07% |
| Ornate Chest | 1-3 | 20% |
| Ancient Statue (sans gems) + Pickaxe | 1 | 100% |
| Pig Head, Merm Head + Hammer | 1 |
| Crawling Horror, Terrorbeak, Terrorclaw | 2 (Hammer) | 100% |
| Reanimated Skeleton | 2-4 | 100% |
| Woven Shadow (on Ancient Fuelweaver death) | 1 | 100% |
| Large Ornate Chest | 5-10 | 75% |

## Usage

Nightmare Fuel is used to craft various Magic items and to fuel **Night Lights** and **Maxwell's** **Codex Umbra** (to summon Shadow Puppets). It is also used to refuel certain items.

## Trivia

- The term "nightmare fuel" is a common phrase on the Internet used to describe works of fiction, or scenes therein, that are extremely likely to disturb and/or frighten the audience.
- When dropped on the ground, Nightmare Fuel appears as pulsing goo.
- Unlike Beardlings, Beardlords do not drop Nightmare Fuel.
- Maxwell, upon examining the Ancient Guardian, says "My my, the fuel has changed you." This implies that prolonged exposure to Nightmare Fuel can alter creatures in some significant way. This is also proven by the ability to turn Chester into his shadow form via Nightmare Fuel.
- According to Webber, Nightmare Fuel feels cold. However, according to Willow, Nightmare Fuel feels warm. This may indicate it has different properties to different people.

## Scrapbook Info
When another survivor is channeling a Lazy Deserter, use this to teleport to them.

## Description
Desert Stones are **Items** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. They are given by the **Antlion** in exchange for **Trinkets** and **Eggs** and can be used to craft **The Lazy Deserter** and the **Turf-Raiser Helm**.

They can also be used by players to teleport themselves to each other and will be consumed in the process. When a Lazy Deserter is being channeled by a player, any other player can right click a Desert Stone to instantly teleport to the channeling player. Teleporting this way will consume 50 **Sanity** as well as the Desert Stone.

### Icon Tools

    |result = Turf-Raiser Helm
    |tool = Blueprint (rare)}}

### Placeholder
#### Trivia
- Desert Stones were added in the **Against the Grain** update.
- According to **Wickerbottom**, Desert Stones are the Antlion's **bezoars**, which are stones found in an animal's stomach and were traditionally believed to be able to cure poison.
- According to **Maxwell**, Desert Stones are impure **Orange Gems**, which makes sense since **Orange Gems** themselves are also used for teleportation.
- Both Maxwell and Wickerbottom's quotes suggest that Antlion could be the source of orange gems in the constant, possibly refining stone, sand and rocks over time into the orange gems, leading to the Antlion expelling them once complete into the caves.

# Bundling Wrap

The **Bundling Wrap** is a **Survival Tab** **Item** that can only be prototyped by using its **Blueprint**. It requires 1 **Wax Paper** and 1 **Rope** to craft, and is used to access 4 storage slots that can be wrapped up to create **Bundled Supplies** holding any items placed within.

### Attributes

- **Burn Time**: 45 sec.
- **Can Be Burned**: 1
- **Description**: Part and parcel to bundling your stuff.
- **Ingredients**:
  - **Wax Paper**: 1
  - **Rope**: 1
- **Tab**: Survival
- **Perk**: Can be used to store 4 stacks of items.
- **Tier**: 7
- **Spawn Code**: "bundlewrap"
- **Stack**: 20

### Quotes

- **Wilson**: Wrapping things up should make them easier to carry.
- **Willow**: We could hide some gross things, I guess.
- **Wolfgang**: Is for hiding goodies.
- **Wendy**: Abigail always helped me tie the bow.
- ...
- **Wickerbottom**: Antibacterial wrapping for food preservation.

## Bundled Supplies

**Bundled Supplies** are created by wrapping up to 4 stacks of items with a Bundling Wrap. It can be stored in **Chests**, **Backpacks**, or the player's **Inventory**. Its appearance changes based on the number of storage slots used when wrapping items, regardless of the size of the stack in any slot or the type of item placed inside. **Food** items can be stored inside Bundled Supplies indefinitely without spoiling, providing a great deal of utility for survival. Unwrapping it will cause all the items stored inside to drop on ground, in addition to 1 Wax Paper.

### Attributes

- **Can Be Burned**: 1
- **Perk**: Can be unwrapped to retrieve items.
- **Stack**: Does not stack.
- **Spawn Code**: "bundle"

### Quotes

- **Wilson**: Our supplies are in there!
- **Willow**: Now I can burn a bunch of things in one go!
- **Wolfgang**: Is little surprise inside, maybe.
- **Wendy**: I don't even remember what's within anymore...
- ...
- **Wartox**: Does a nice surprise await inside?

## Downloadable Content

- In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, the **Fishbone** cannot be put inside Bundled Supplies.
- In the **Hamlet** DLC, its blueprint is dropped by the **Queen Womant** instead since Bees and Killer Bees are unavailable. The **Ro Bin Gizzard Stone** cannot be put inside Bundled Supplies.

## Tips

- Since unwrapping a Bundled Supplies returns the Wax Paper used to craft Bundling Wrap, the only net loss per use is 1 Rope.
- Each held Bundling Wrap can be used to gain three extra inventory slots, useful when collecting a lot of resources and transporting said resources from one place to another.
- A common use for Bundling Wraps is for storing **Light Bulb**s, as they no longer spoil quickly while bundled.

## Trivia

- Bundling Wraps and Bundled Supplies were first introduced to **Don't Starve Together** in the **Herd Mentality** update during **A New Reign**. They were later added to **Don't Starve** in the **Quality of Life** update.
- According to **Wickerbottom**, Bundling Wrap has antibacterial effects. This may explain why bundled Food does not perish: Wax Paper neutralizes the microbes that cause spoilage.

## Bugs

- A bug may occur where a Bundled Supplies turns invisible, but remains present in a player's inventory.

# Red Hound

## Overview
The Red Hound, also known as Fire Hound, Flame Hound, or Hellhound, is a hostile creature in the game that can spawn during Summer and Autumn during Hound attacks and from Hound Mounds. Here is a detailed information box about the Red Hound:

| Diet     | Meat [[File:Meats.png|32px|]] |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Name     | Red Hound                             |
| Image    | File:Red_Hound.png                    |
| Health   | 100                                  |
| Damage   | 30                                   |
| Drops    | Monster Meat, Hound's Tooth, Ashes, Red Gem (20%), Fire x3 |
| Attack Period | 2 |
| Attack Range | 3 |
| Run Speed | 10                                |
| Sanity Aura | -40                             |
| Special Ability | Bursts into flames when killed |
| Spawns From | DS: Hound Mound, RoG: Hound Mound, Varg |

## Quotes
- Wilson: That one is glowy.
- Maxwell: I put fire gems in there as a joke.
- Wickerbottom: That hound is more dangerous than the others.
- And more...

## Red Hound Behavior and Attacks
Red Hounds have less health than regular Hounds, cannot be set on fire, and have a higher resistance to the effects of an Ice Staff. Upon death, they "explode" into 3 large fires that will burn for at least six seconds, then extinguish into Ashes. These fires can easily spread to nearby flammable objects. When killed, Red Hounds will always drop 1 Monster Meat and 1 Hound's Tooth, with a chance to drop 1 Red Gem.

Red Hounds can be part of a Fire Staff Trap, where they sleep around the Fire Staff, and if the Fire Staff is taken, they will wake up and attack, causing a significant sanity loss and starting to rain.

## Periodic Hound Attacks
When a Hound attack is imminent, snorting and growling sounds will be heard. Characters will also call attention to these sounds. The attack frequency can be configured in World Customization.

## Fighting Strategy
Hounds are much faster than the player and cannot be outrun unless they become distracted or belong to a Hound Mound. One effective strategy to defeat Hounds is by using Tooth Traps. Players can also use a Walking Cane or run along a Road to outrun them.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants (ROG) DLC, if a player tracks a Varg, the Varg can spot the player and howl, calling two Hounds to help attack the player. Depending on the season, these Hounds can be normal, Blue, and Red.

## Trivia
- Hounds and Red Hounds were added in "The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You" update.
- The Red Hound is available for use on Steam as a chat emoticon.
- Red Hounds are the only mobs that take 16 hits from an Ice Staff to be frozen - the maximum for most Mobs is 4.

## Bugs
- Saving the game when the Hound attack warning begins and then loading that save will cause the attack to become bugged.
- Occasionally, dying in a Cave and getting resurrected on the surface will cause the growling and snorting sounds to play in half-day intervals.
- Sometimes, Hound attacks will 'reset'; the growling warning will last longer and only two normal Hounds will spawn.

## Doydoy

- **Willow**: There is no spark behind its eyes.
- **Wolfgang**: Small dumb bird!
- **Wendy**: This bird seems too stupid to be alive.
- **WX-78**: INTELLIGENCE NOT DETECTED
- **Wickerbottom**: What a fascinating species!
- **Woodie**: Not too sure how this awful thing survives.
- **Maxwell**: This sad creature has no hope of survival.
- **Wigfrid**: It shows no trace of fear for me!
- **Webber**: Nothing behind the eyes...
- **Walani**: Well hey there little guy.
- **Warly**: I see potential in this poultry.
- **Woodlegs**: 'Tis a stupid lookin bird.
- **Wagstaff**: What a ludicrously doltish bird!
- **Wilba**: 'TIS BIRD O' DOYNESS
- **Wormwood**: Odd Tweeter
- **Wheeler**: I waited my whole life to see a bird like that. It wasn't worth the wait.

### Behavior
Doydoys sleep at night, like Beefalo. When asleep, they can be picked up. While in the inventory, they need to be fed periodically to prevent them from starving to death. They can be fed basic materials (Grass, Sticks, Logs, Rocks), and most foods except Doydoy Eggs. While in the inventory, they can be murdered by right-clicking. When not in the inventory, they do not need to be fed, and they do not starve. When dropped, Doydoys will stay asleep for a few seconds, so they can be picked up again and relocated.

### Breeding
Every 2–3 days, the world attempts to pair two Doydoys, causing them to mate. If no Doydoys are close to each other, or there are already 20 Doydoys in the world, then no mating occurs. Mating involves a ten-second dance, in which one Doydoy will start to scream, alerting nearby players, after which the Nest is made. If left alone, the egg hatches from the nest after two days, producing a Baby Doydoy, which can only be fed seeds. After two days, the Baby Doydoy will grow into a Teen Doydoy, which can be fed seeds or vegetables. After only one day as a teen, the Doydoy will grow to an adult and be able to be fed anything.

### Naughtiness
| Doydoys remaining | Naughtiness |
|-------------------|------------|
| 1-2               | 50         |
| 3-4               | 10         |
| 5-10              | 4          |
| 11-20             | 1          |

### Tips
- Breeding Doydoys is strongly advantageous to the player's survival as they supply mixed Meat items, and Doydoy Feathers which are used to craft the Feather Lite Sail and Tropical Fan. The feathers are also a significant offering to the Volcano Altar of Snackrifice.

### Trivia
- Based on their name, appearance and passive nature, the Doydoy is the Don't Starve version of the extinct flightless bird known as the Dodo.

### Bugs
- When Doydoys are enclosed in a small pen, with one of the sides facing the ocean, it is possible for a Doydoy to be

## Tips

- Most sources of Bone Shards are finite, and obtaining more is oftentimes a slow process, or requires players to die. Letting Fish Morsels and Raw Fish spoil, and then hammering the resulting spoiled meat is a safe and reliable, albeit slow source of Bone Shards.
- Wilson can create more Bone Shards by combining Hound's Teeth together, assuming he has the Transmute Icky III skill. This can allow for the mass production of Bone Shards, and by extension Bone Bouillon if a reliable source of Hound's Teeth, such as a Hound Mound, is accessible

# Deerclops Eyeball

![Deerclops Eyeball](Deerclops Eyeball.png)

The **Deerclops Eyeball** is a [meat](Food_Type#Meat) item dropped by the [Deerclops]. It is similar to a [Guardian's Horn](Guardian's Horn). Both are dropped by a boss, unable to spoil, and restore health and hunger but decrease sanity.

- **HP Restored:** 60
- **Hunger Restored:** 75
- **Sanity Restored:** -15
- **Spoil:** Does not spoil
- **Stack:** [DS] Does not stack / [All DLC] 10
- **Dropped by:** ![Deerclops](Deerclops.png)
- **Spawn Code:** "deerclops_eyeball"
- **Sold By:** [Ham](The Sty' Oddities Emporium) (Oinc ×50)

## Quotes

- **Wilson:** "This is really gross."
- **Willow:** "Stop staring at me!"
- **Wolfgang:** "Yuck yuck yuck!"
- **Wendy:** "What terrors must it see."
- **WX-78:** "A GIANT ORGANIC LENS"
- **Wickerbottom:** "I feel a vague sense of accomplishment."
- **Woodie:** "Now what is this good for?"
- **Maxwell:** "Deerclops are so myopic."
- **Wagstaff:** "Theoretically, it has some connection to the dark forces here."
- **Wigfrid:** "Hmm, shall I eat it?"
- **Webber:** "Yucktastic."
- **Walani:** "Aw. Kind of reminds me of the boss."
- **Warly:** "Giant eyeball... soup?"
- **Woodlegs:** "Tis a giant eyeball."
- **Wilba:** "EYE PLUCK'D FROM HEAD O' BEASTIE"
- **Wormwood:** "(poke)"
- **Wheeler:** "I wonder if its eye is bigger than its stomach."
- **Winona:** "You lookin' at me? Are YOU lookin' at ME?"
- **Wortox:** "Apologies, dear sir."
- **Wurt:** "Oooh, want to touch it."
- **Walter:** "At least we got this souvenir."
- **Wanda:** "I'll bet that creature didn't foresee its day ending like this."

## Usage

The Deerclops Eyeball can be used as a crafting material; it is required to make the [Houndius Shootius]. It can also be used as emergency food, granting 60 HP, 75 hunger, and draining 15 sanity.

### Crafting Recipes

#### Houndius Shootius
- **Deerclops Eyeball**
- **Guardian's Horn**
- **Thulecite (5)**

#### Eyebrella
- **Deerclops Eyeball**
- **Twigs (15)**
- **Bone Shards (4)**

## Downloadable Content

In all DLCs, the Deerclops Eyeball can now stack up to 10 in the player's inventory.

In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, it can also be used to craft the [Eyebrella]. If the player obtains their first Deerclops Eyeball, prioritizing the Eyebrella craft is crucial towards survival during the players first Spring, due to the constant rain and lightning strikes.

In the **Hamlet** DLC, Deerclops Eyeballs can be bought for 50 Oincs at [The Sty' Oddities Emporium].

## Tips

- If the player obtains their first Deerclops Eyeball, prioritizing the Eyebrella craft is crucial towards survival during the player's first Spring, due to the frequent rain and lightning strikes.
- The Eyebrella can delay overheating by a surprising amount during the first Summer. Using some [Sewing Kits] can let the player keep the Eyebrella in good condition, letting it last long enough until Autumn comes.
- If used sparingly, an Eyebrella could easily last an entire year with little or no repairs. With the use of a Sewing Kit, a single Eyebrella could last multiple years, allowing the player to stock up on Deerclops Eyeballs for a Houndius Shootius, or a spare Eyebrella in case the first one is lost.
- Players can use the [Hostile Flare] to fight Deerclops more than once per Winter season, with the goal to acquire more than one Deerclops Eyeball.

# Varg

![Varg](File:Warg.png){width=280px}

### Health, Damage, and Stats
- **Health**: 600
- **Damage**: 50
- **Attack Period**: 3
- **Attack Range**: 5
- **Run Speed**: 5.5

### Spawn Information
- **Spawns**: Hound, Red Hound, Blue Hound
- **Spawn Code**: "warg"
- **Drops**: Hound's Tooth (1-3), Monster Meat (4-6)
- **Spawns From**: Suspicious Dirt Pile

### Quotes
- Wilson: You might be something to reckon with, big dog.
- Willow: You're a big mean jerk!
- Wolfgang: Big puppy!
- Wendy: A true bastion of evil.
- ... (and more)

### Attack Pattern
The Varg will howl, calling forth two Hounds to the battle. Vargs are able to summon both normal and special Hounds (based on the season), which is decided at random. A single Varg can summon up to five hounds and will not summon any more until they are killed, no matter how far apart the Hounds are from their Varg.

### Usage
The Varg can effectively be used as a way to spawn Hounds if there are no nearby Hound Mounds (or all the Hound Mounds in the current world are destroyed). One way to do this is by leading the Varg into a pen with a large gap in the side. The player should run into the pen and put the Varg to sleep once it follows inside. The player must then exit the pen and close the gap. The Varg will still summon Hounds if the player wanders too close, but it will not attack any of the walls that confine it.

### Tips
- A Varg has a limit of 6-8 Hound followers, after which it will stop summoning them. If any of its spawn dies, or moves too far away from the Varg, it will attempt to summon more.
- Sleeping Vargs may be woken up by the barking of any nearby Hounds. They may also awaken if the player stands too close to them for too long, similar to Beefalo in heat.
- The Varg will always howl to summon Hounds when it can do so. It is even able to do so for a brief moment after it has died after its death animation.

### Trivia
- The Warg is a wolf-like creature from Norse mythology. The term was used to refer to Fenrir and his offspring.
- J. R. R. Tolkien popularized Wargs in his fantasy novels set in Middle Earth, like The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. They are also popular in Dungeons & Dragons, where they are known as "Worgs" or "Dire Wolves".
- If a Varg is spawned in the Caves or Ruins, it will summon Depths Worms instead of Hounds.
- Out of all the creatures that drop Monster Meat, a Varg can drop the second highest number, with a maximum of six, beaten only by the Pugalisk, which can drop up to 16.
- Vargs were added to Don't Starve Together before the rest of the Reign of Giants DLC in the Stuck in the Middle with Ewe update.

# Monster Lasagna

### Description
Monster Lasagna is a [Meat](#) Food item cooked in the [Crock Pot](#) by combining 2 [Monster Food](#) items, which include [Monster Meat](#), [Monster Jerky](#), [Durian](#)s, and [Jellyfish](#). It takes 10 seconds to cook.

- **SanityRestored**: -20
- **Cooktime**: 10 sec
- **Priority**: 10
- **SoldBy**: [The Sterling Trough Deli](#) (Oinc ×2)
- **SpawnCode**: "monsterlasagna"

### Quotes
- Wilson: "It's an affront to science."
- Willow: "Noodles, meat and clumps of hair. Nasty."
- Wolfgang: "Taste like hairs and meats with noodle."
- Wendy: "Cooked evil is still evil, even in lasagna."
- WX-78: "DIRTY ENERGY"
- Wickerbottom: "Lasagna or no, it would still be hazardous to consume it."
- Woody: "This is cat food!"
- Maxwell: "It would be unwise to ingest this."
- Wagstaff: "A pungent pasta that will no doubt do me harm."
- Wigfrid: "Mönster casseröle."
- Webber: "Mmm!"
- Walani: "Still smells monstery..."
- Warly: "What a wasted effort..."
- Woodlegs: "Not me favorite."
- Wilba: "'TIS DISH O' PURPLE MEATS"
- Wormwood: "For belly?"
- Wheeler: "I've had some bad meals in my lifetime. And this is one of them."
- Winona: "Not sure meat's supposed to be that color."
- Wortox: "Even the mortals dislike it."
- Wurt: "What... in this?"
- Wanda: "Maybe I'm not so hungry after all..."

### Prerequisites
- Requires: [Monster Food Crock Pot](#)
- Excludes: [Twigs](#)

### Cookbook Recipe
| Item   | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Monster Foods | 2 |
| Filler  | 2 |
| Tool   | Crock Pot |
| Result | Monster Lasagna |

### Crock Pot Examples
* Monster Meat + Monster Meat + Monster Meat + Monster Meat -> Monster Lasagna
* Monster Meats + Berry + Berry -> Monster Lasagna
* Monster Meat + Egg + Egg -> Monster Lasagna (50% chance of producing [Bacon and Eggs](#))
* Monster Meats + Durians + Mandrake + Berry -> Monster Lasagna (50% chance of producing [Mandrake Soup](#))
* Durians + Berry + Berry -> Monster Lasagna
* Dead Jellyfishes + Berry + Berry -> Monster Lasagna (Shipwrecked DLC)

### Prototype Tips
- While the Monster Lasagna damages health when eaten it still restores a big chunk of durability for both the [Eye Mask](#) and the [Shield of Terror](#).
- It is best to avoid this Crock Pot Recipe, as it restores less Hunger than most of what would be used as ingredients, and causes a bad chunk of Health and Sanity loss. Although cooked Monster Meats on their own would cause a lot less Health loss, eating two would cause the same Sanity loss as Monster Lasagna.
- For Wilba, Monster Lasagna counts as one Monster Food towards her [Werewilba](#) transformation.

### Trivia
* Woodie's quote may be a reference to the comic [Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield), which revolves around a cat that loves lasagna.
* During the [Pig Fiesta](#) event in the [Don't Starve: Hamlet](#) DLC, Monster Lasagna takes on a more festive appearance.
