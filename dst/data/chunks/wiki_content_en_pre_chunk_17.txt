# Life Giving Amulet

- **Scrapbook Description:** A Ghost that haunts this amulet will be revived.
- **Tier:** 4
- **Filter:** Healing Filter, Magic Filter
- **Ingredients:**
  - Gold Nugget ×3
  - Nightmare Fuel ×2
  - Red Gem ×1
- **Dropped By:** Grave, Ancient Pseudoscience Station, Loot Stash
- **Perk:** Converts Hunger to Health. Resurrects the player and puts nearby mobs to sleep.
- **Sanity Drain:** +2/min
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Durability:** 20 uses (Healing), 1 use (Resurrecting)
- **Spawn Code:** "amulet"
- **Description:** Protects you from death.

## Quotes
- Wilson: I feel so safe when I'm wearing it.
- Willow: I'm invincible! Well, maybe not. But it feels good.
- Wolfgang: Is very pretty.
- Wendy: I wonder who used to own this.
- WX78: ANOMALY DETECTED
- Wickerbottom: A relic from another time.
- Woodie: Always have a backup plan.
- Maxwell: It channels the darkest energies of the universe.
- Wagstaff: Finally a way to experience what death is like!
- Wigfrid: It's red, and a fighter. Just like me!
- Webber: It's a fine necklace, I suppose.
- Walani: Looks great, feels great.
- Warly: I wear safety.
- Woodlegs: A wee bit o'insurance round me neck.
- Wilba: 'TIS SPARKLY THING WHAT GIVETH LIFE!
- Wormwood: Yay! More life!
- Wheeler: Now I can have two lifetimes of adventure.
- Winona: Jewelry ain't really my thing.
- Wortox: A glimmering jewel that's rife with life.
- Wurt: Pretty magic rock!
- Walter: I'm invincible!!
- Wanda: I'll breathe easier knowing I have a backup plan.

## Resurrection Effects
- Health (HP) is set to 50
- Hunger is set to 2/3 of maximum
- Sanity is set to 1/2 of maximum
- Empty inventory (items can be found at place of death)

## Usage
When worn, the Life Giving Amulet will recover 5 HP at the cost of 5 Hunger every 30 seconds until fully healed. This reduces the durability of the item by 5% every time it heals, so it is possible for the amulet to break without reviving the player. Equipping amulets also restore +2 Sanity per minute with no effect on durability.

The Life Giving Amulet doesn't resurrect its wearer automatically. Ghost Characters have to haunt a dropped amulet to revive. It will also put the nearby mobs to sleep after resurrection. Unlike Telltale Hearts, using the amulet does not result in max health penalty.

## Skins
- Woven - Elegant Clairvoyant Life Amulet: Introduced during The Forge event in 2017.
- Woven - Elegant Clement Life Amulet: Introduced during Year of the Varg event in 2018.
- Loyal Rosy Red Amulet: Awarded for watching 3 hours of Don't Starve Together on Twitch from May 2, 2024 to May 30, 2024.

## Tips
- All bosses and some enemies, such as the Ancient Guardian and Clockwork Bishops, are immune to the sleep effect, so the player may get attacked and die again. It is better to flee from these fights when the player is not in a favorable position.
- Should the player die, resurrection will occur regardless of how much durability is left, as long as it's above zero. So there is no reason to not use the Amulet to heal wounds until it reaches 5% durability.
- This item is especially useful when playing as Maxwell. Because of his low maximum Health, Meat Effigies are not recommended, leaving only the Amulet as a way of resurrecting the player when Touch Stones are not available. The amulet also is useful for healing after using the Codex Umbra.
- It is not a good idea to store Life Giving Amulets in a Backpack because they cannot be used to resurrect unless they're laying on the ground.

## Trivia
- The Life Giving Amulet was added in The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You update.
- The Life Giving Amulet used to be called just "Amulet" before other amulets, such as the Nightmare Amulet, were added. It lost its old texture when it became the Life Giving Amulet, which was similar to the one used for the now defunct Gemology crafting tab.

# Tent

## Description
The **Tent** is a **Survival** structure that can be used to sleep through **dusk and night**, like an immobile **Straw Roll** or **Fur Roll**. It will restore 50 **Sanity** and 60 **Health** at the cost of 75 **Hunger**, and set the player's body temperature to maximum when used. It requires 6 **Silk**, 4 **Twigs**, 3 **Rope** to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. The player is also immune to any damage except fire while using the tent.

## Crafting
- **Silk**: 6
- **Twigs**: 4
- **Rope**: 3

## Usage
- **Sanity Bonus**: 50
- **Health Bonus**: 60
- **Hunger Cost**: -75
- **Durability**: 10 uses

## Perk
Restores health and sanity, reduces wetness and raises body temperature, at the expense of hunger.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "I get crazy when I don't sleep."
- **Willow**: "I got all the badges in Girl Scouts."
- **Wolfgang**: "It is time for a mighty nap."
- **Wendy**: "Sleep is but a preview of death."
- **WX-78**: "I CAN REBOOT IN THERE"
- **Wickerbottom**: "Sleeping in there would give me a stiff neck."
- **Woodie**: "I'm used to sleeping in worse."
- **Maxwell**: "That's a bit rustic for my taste."
- **Wagstaff**: "Its restorative properties are quite intriguing."
- **Wigfrid**: "Sleep this night, and prepare for battle on the morrow."
- **Webber**: "We should get some rest."
- **Walani**: "A cool, dry place to catch some Zzz's."
- **Warly**: "For roughing it."
- **Woodlegs**: "I prefers a water bed."
- **Wilba**: "WILBA SLEEP 'NEATH THE STARS"
- **Wormwood**: "Little home"
- **Wheeler**: "Nothing more therapeutic than sleeping in some spiderwebs."

## Tips
- Unequipping any items that lose **durability** while worn before sleeping will save their durability.
- In the base game, you can save some Hunger by using the Tent when your Hunger is lower than 75. If it is lower than 26 however, the character will refuse to go to sleep.
- When used in tandem with a **Siesta Lean-to**, the Tent can allow a player to quickly skip days or even seasons at the expense of food.
- Even though **Wormwood** cannot heal from eating food, the Tent allows him to deal with this restriction by converting Hunger points to Health (and Sanity).
- Wearing a **Slurper**, **Belt of Hunger**, **Hibearnation Vest** or **Funcap** or playing as **Wolfgang**, **Wes**, or **Warly** doesn't change the Hunger cost of sleeping in a Tent.
- The Tent is one of the few structures in the game that costs **Silk**. Having it prebuilt can provide some emergency silk when carrying a **Hammer** to save inventory space.

## Trivia
- The Tent's original use was to allow the player to change their character. Crafting the tent cost more resources (15 Silk, 6 Twigs, and 3 Ropes), its crafting description was "Change your skin", and the Tent would be destroyed after one use. This functionality was changed in the 2013 "Progress!" update.

## Bugs
- Sometimes after a 100% torch is equipped before sleeping, after the character sleeps the torch will still have a durability of 20%, and it will not lose durability. Unequipping and equipping the torch again will fix the bug.
- Sleeping while taking damage from **Freezing** may cause the edges of the screen to be stuck red. This will persist until the game is reloaded or if the character starts taking freezing damage again and warms back up.
- Sometimes a tent may be used 7 times before disappearing.

## Description
Prime Ape Huts are naturally spawning Structures found in the Shipwrecked DLC. They are found in the Jungle biome and spawn Prime Apes. They can also be crafted using 10 Twigs, 3 Bananas, and 4 Manure, and require an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Each hut supports 3 or 4 Prime Apes, and new Prime Apes will spawn after 120 seconds to replace any that are killed.

As with any other craftable structure, Prime Ape Huts, including naturally occurring ones, can be Hammered to return half of the resources needed to craft it, as well as a Gnome (1% of the time), or a Tarnished Crown (10% of the time if Wilbur is not unlocked). When Hammered, one or two Prime Apes may also escape before the hut is destroyed, and become aggressive towards the player, throwing Manure.

If a Prime Ape Hut is built in the Ruins, the Prime Apes spawned from it will be affected by the Nightmare Cycle.

## Trivia
- A Purple Gem, Spoiled Fish, Dubloons, a Hound's Tooth, a coconut, and a Banana Peel can all be seen inside of the hut if one looks closely.
- Its old crafting description was "Wanna monkey around?".
- The Prime Ape Hut's spawn code is similar to that of the Splumonkey Pod which used to be a barrel in reference to the phrase "more fun than a barrel of monkeys".

# Insulated Pack

## Overview
The Insulated Pack is a backpack used to expand the character's inventory in the game Don't Starve Together.

It requires 1 Thick Fur, 1 Gears, and 1 Electrical Doodad to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

## Crafting
- **Ingredients:**
  - Thick Fur: 1
  - Gears: 1
  - Electrical Doodad: 1

- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** icepack
- **Tier:** 2
- **Equip Slot:** Body
- **Perk:** +8 inventory slots, contents receive a 50% spoilage rate.
- **Description:** Small capacity, but keeps stuff fresh.

## Exclusivity
Don't Starve Together

## Quotes
- Wilson: The fur keeps the temperature inside stable.
- Willow: Fuzzy backpack!
- Wolfgang: Furry bag.
- Wendy: It won't insulate me from the horrors of this world.
- WX78: INTERIOR THERMALS STABLE
- Wickerbottom: Perfectly insulated.

## Scrapbook Info
An 8 slots container that halves the speed of food spoiling inside.

## Tips
- Despite not being food, any animals stored inside will starve 0.5x as fast.
- By the second Autumn and after killing Bearger, an Insulated Pack can completely substitute a Backpack, since they both have the same amount of slots and it can additionally slow down food spoilage.

## Trivia
- In the July 25, 2019 patch, the amount of inventory slots was increased from 6 to 8, to compete with Warly's Chef Pouch. In the May 28, 2020 patch, the Gears and Electrical Doodad cost was reduced to 1.

If the server is set to Endless or Relaxed Mode, it can be used by a **Ghost Characters|dead** player to resurrect at a cost of 25% of their maximum **Health** (this penalty can be reversed with use of **Booster Shots**).

The Florid Postern can be converted into the **Celestial Portal** using a **Portal Paraphernalia** and constructed using 20 **Moon Rocks** and a **Purple Moonlens**.

## Spawn Mechanics
When a new world is generated, one Florid Postern is created in the overworld and the caves (if it's enabled). It remains stationary throughout the game. When a new player joins the server, the open space of the portal will light up slowly and then fade back to normal, revealing the new player. All players will spawn from the portal that was generated during the start of a new world.

## Regrowth Mechanics
In Endless mode, the game will check to see if there are any players within a radius of a little over 60 ground tiles around the Florid Postern every 30 to 60 seconds. If there are no players within that radius, the game will then check to see if there are any basic resources within a radius of a little over 15 ground tiles around the Florid Postern. The basic resources that it checks for can be split into four categories; flint, twigs, grass, and berries.

## Trivia
- The Florid Postern took the place of the **Jury-Rigged Portal** when the game left Early Access. Its functionality is the same, though the characters' reactions to it are different.
- If the Postern is deleted with the console, new players will still spawn at the spot the portal used to be.
- In the colony game **Oxygen Not Included**, another game by Klei, the sound of the portal is shared with the building **Space Heater**.
- According to the flavor text for the Florid Postern **Portrait Frames|Portrait Frame**, the Postern works by joining the survivors' dimensions.
- Charlie as of **A New Reign** has been shown to manipulate a form of shadow fire, which is reflected in the Postern's black flames on its columns. Willow even notes that the Postern's vines "coil away from [her] lighter" as if they are also made of the shadow fire.

## Bugs
- The Ruins soundtracks are played when music events are triggered near the Florid Postern in the Caves.

## Maxwell Statues Description
Maxwell Statues are naturally-spawning structures that can be found in various set pieces, although they are most common in Chess biomes in Survival Mode. They were constructed by Maxwell during his time on the Nightmare Throne, as a monument to himself. However, now that Charlie has replaced him as ruler of The Constant, they only serve as an ironic mockery of his past actions. They are often guarded by local Clockwork Monsters. When mined using a Pickaxe or similar tool, they drop 2-3 Marbles.

Maxwell Statues make two notable appearances in Adventure Mode:

- In Chapter 3, assuming the template is not "Two Worlds", the Chess biome where Wes is being held prisoner contains several Statues being used to trap him, which release 3-4 Clockwork Monsters when destroyed. To save Wes and unlock him, the player must destroy every Statue and defeat the Monsters spawned from them.
- In "Checkmate", there is a Statue just before the Nightmare Throne that spawns 3-4 Clockwork Monsters when broken; However, it also reduces the player's Sanity to 0 until they are all defeated.

In Don't Starve Together, Maxwell Statues will also drop a Sketch for the Chess Pieces#

### Crafting
Thulecite is a craftable item found in the Ancient Tab. It requires 6 Thulecite Fragments and a Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station to be crafted. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Thulecite cannot be prototyped and Characters must stand near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft it.

### Usage
- Crafting material for items in the Ancient Tab
- Repairing a Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station

### Acquisition
Thulecite is generally acquired by destroying Ancient Statues and Ruins Sinkholes with a Pickaxe, Gunpowder etc., but it also has a 10% chance to be found in Ornate Chests and a 75% chance in Large Ornate Chests. Thulecite also can randomly drop when destroying Relics or damaging Ancient Pseudoscience Stations with a Hammer or by other methods.

### Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, players have a small chance of finding Green Gems inside Tumbleweeds, thus making Thulecite renewable, since more Thulecite can be gained with the use of Construction Amulets and Deconstruction Staves as explained below.

### Recipes
- Thulecite Wall: Thulecite + Broken Pseudoscience Station
- Thulecite Crown: Thulecite x4 + Nightmare Fuel x4
- Thulecite Suit: Thulecite x6 + Nightmare Fuel x4

## Twiggy Trees

Twiggy Trees are a resource variant of Saplings exclusive to *Don't Starve Together*. Their life cycle alternates between small, normal, large, and old states. A complete cycle lasts between 9.5 and 15.5 days and they grow in all seasons. When chopped down, they yield Twigs, Logs, and Twiggy Tree Cones. Every time a Twiggy tree changes stage from old to short, it checks the ground for Twigs in a 2 pitchfork tile radius. If there are no Twigs on the ground in that area, the tree will drop one. If there is 1 Twig, it has a 1/2 chance of dropping one. If there are 2 or more twigs in that radius, no more twigs will spawn.

### Tips

- Compared to Saplings, the benefits of Twiggy Trees are: They will continue to provide Twigs during Winter, they will not wither during Summer, they will continue spawning Twigs without the player having to interact with them, they can be multiplied, and if chopped, they yield a log along with the seed to replant it.
- Despite the benefits, it is preferable to have a world mostly occupied by saplings. This is because twiggy trees take much more time to harvest than saplings and require an axe to chop. Ironically, getting the twigs to make an axe early on can be difficult, especially on worlds with a lot of players. Also, they can be propagated easily, allowing you to have the benefits of both twig sources in a single world.
- When chopping twiggy trees purely for twigs, it is actually more efficient to chop the short trees. (Short trees take 5 chops each allowing for 3 twigs every 15 chops. Large trees take 15 chops each and only drop 2 twigs.)

### Trivia

- Twiggy Trees are considered to be part of *A New Reign*, even though they were introduced before the official start of the beta branch.
- Twiggy Trees were re-skinned in the Rev. 180814.
- Twiggy Trees used to be able to get Diseased and would die after a few days as they were not meant to co-exist with Saplings. In *A New Reign*, however, this feature has been removed.
- Based on their leaves and pine cones, Twiggy Trees are probably based on an araucarian.

# Straw Hat

## Overview
The **Straw Hat** is a **Hat** that reduces **Wetness** gain by 20% and provides 60 points of protection against **Overheating**. It requires 12 **Cut Grass** to craft and does not need to be prototyped. The Straw Hat loses durability when worn, lasting a total of 5 days. It can be repaired with a **Sewing Kit**, restoring 100% of its durability. Additionally, it is used to craft the **Bush Hat**, **Miner Hat**, and **Rain Hat**.

## Crafting
With the **Seasonal Starting Items** default preset, the Straw Hat will be given to any players joining a world for the first time, during **Spring**.

## Recipes
### Miner Hat
- **Straw Hat** x1
- **Gold Nugget** x1
- **Fireflies** x1
- **Result**: Miner Hat
- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine

### Bush Hat
- **Straw Hat** x1
- **Rope** x1
- **Berry Bush Item** x1
- **Result**: Bush Hat
- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine

### Rain Hat
- **Moleworm** x2
- **Straw Hat** x1
- **Bone Shards** x1
- **Result**: Rain Hat
- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine

## Skins
In **Don't Starve Together**, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the **Belongings** page.

- **Woven - Elegant Cowboy Straw Hat** skin was introduced during the official **Year of the Pig King** event in 2019.

  - ![Straw Bonnet Icon](Straw Bonnet Icon.png) **Woven - Elegant Straw Bonnet**
  - ![Floppy Straw Hat Icon](Floppy Straw Hat Icon.png) **Elegant Floppy Straw Hat**

## Tips
- Wearing a Straw Hat while holding an **Umbrella** is enough to provide 100% water resistance, preventing players from getting wet in the **Rain**.
- A Straw Hat that is running low on durability can be used to craft a Bush Hat, Miner Hat, or Rain Hat, or added to a **Campfire** or **Fire Pit** as fuel.

## Trivia
- Despite being made of Cut Grass, this hat is non-flammable.

## Usage

The Feather Pencil is a craftable item located in the Tools Tab. It requires a Science Machine to prototype and can be crafted with 1 Twigs, 1 Charcoal, and 1 Jet Feather. The Feather Pencil can be used to draw an item on a Mini Sign, which breaks the pencil. The closest item placed on the ground is what will be drawn on the Mini Sign when using a Feather Pencil.

In Don't Starve Together, the Feather Pencil can additionally be used to craft a Map Scroll and Wigfrid's Battle Songs.

## The 'Sea Legs' Details
The 'Sea Legs' is a craftable Boat in the Shipwrecked DLC, exclusive to Woodlegs. It can be found in the Nautical Tab and requires 4 Boards, 4 Dubloons, and 1 Boat Cannon to craft. The 'Sea Legs' begins with 500 durability, which will deplete if damaged or over time as it is used. It can be repaired with the Boat Repair Kit or Sea Yard. It does not allow attachments, however it comes with a Boat Cannon that does 50 damage and has infinite uses. It also comes with a Sail, allowing the player to hold a lit Torch while moving.

- **Durability Loss**: 1 per 3.84 seconds, lasting a total of 4 Days
- **Hit Immunity**: 1 second
- **Map Reveal Bonus**: 2

## Tips
1. Destroying the Sea Legs with a Hammer yields 2 Boards, 2 Dubloons, and 1 Boat Cannon at 100% durability. By crafting the Sea Legs using almost depleted cannons then subsequently demolishing it with a hammer, Woodlegs is able to in effect “refill” Boat Cannons for 2 boards and 2 dubloons.
2. The infinite uses of the cannon allows the player to easily kill sea life, such as Jellyfish and Dogfish, collecting large amounts of Food with very little effort.
3. This can be really useful for killing Blue Whales and White Whales, as creatures damaged with a Boat Cannon will not aggro the player.
4. The infinite uses of the cannon can also be used to mine Boulders and Coral Reefs, as well as digging Sand and X Marks the Spot.
5. Care should be taken when mining coral reefs, because hitting a cannon shot on an already mined coral reef will result it in being hammered down, yielding Limestone and Coral Nubbin.
6. The cannon is not advised for farming logs nor charcoal, as the tree will always break first, then the trunk will catch fire and burn the logs nearby, and everything will result in ash.

## Trivia
- Spawning The 'Sea Legs' using the Console will spawn it without the cannon and sail, even if the player is playing as Woodlegs.

## Tips
A player can farm Hound's Teeth by trapping a Varg in a walled enclosure. It will attract endless Hounds, which can be dispatched with a nearby array of Tooth Traps. The Hounds will be attracted by Monster Meat. Lure one into the traps using yourself as bait and it will drop Monster Meat, baiting the rest of the Hounds into the traps as well. The dropped Hound's Teeth can be used to replenish the Tooth Traps, making the farm largely self-sufficient. It's recommended to only farm for Hound's Teeth in Winter and Spring, as Blue Hounds are guaranteed to drop two Hound's Teeth, whereas a Red Hound will only drop one.

## Trivia
According to Wickerbottom, Hound's Teeth contain brimstone, also known as sulfur. In folklore, sulfur is often associated with demons, implying that the in-game Hounds are Hellh

## Overview
The Accomploshrine is a craftable structure only available on the console versions of *Don't Starve*. It requires 10 Gold Nuggets, 1 Cut Stone, and 6 Gears to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

![Willow](and despair.jpg?raw=true){: .left} 
**Willow** attaining the "**...and despair!**" achievement.

The Accomploshrine's sole purpose is to grant two PSN/Xbox achievements. To attain the trophies, the player must first build the Accomploshrine to earn the **"Look on my works, ye Mighty,"** achievement, then activate the Accomploshrine a total of 725 times within one game to earn the **"...and despair!"** achievement.

Each time the player turns the handle on the device, the cranking sound will play at a higher and higher pitch until the 25th crank. After every 25th activation, the shrine will release a firework with a similar light effect as **Lightning**, and the player's character will remark on their accomplishment. When the player obtains the **"...and despair!"** achievement, a bigger fireworks explosion, flags, and music will come out of the Accomploshrine, and the character will comment again on their achievement.

## Trivia
- **Klei** did not want to add any sort of achievements for *Don't Starve*, but Sony required them to do so for the PS4 release. This item was added begrudgingly as a jab at the pointlessness of achievements.
- The name of the two Accomploshrine achievements are a reference to Percy Bysshe Shelley's sonnet **"Ozymandias"**, in which a broken statue with the inscription "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" is found in an empty desert; all the king's work was ultimately meaningless, just like the Accomploshrine and its achievements.
- Since this structure uses Gears and has no uses, besides being a cosmetic and situational light, it's unwise to build it more than once, though players might build these to show off material abundance.

- **Walter:** W-what could go wrong?
- **Wanda:** You come after me, you get the bees!
- **Choose:** Wilson

## Crafting and Usage
A **Bee Mine** is a **Fight Tab** **Item** that releases **Bees** on a **mob** that steps on it. It requires 1 **Board**, 4 **Bees**, and 1 **Flint** to craft and a **Science Machine** to prototype.

To lay a **Bee Mine**, it must be placed on the ground with the right mouse button (the left mouse button will simply drop the mine). Placed mines will become armed a second after being placed. If a player has mines in the **Caves** and dies, the mines will disarm themselves and must be set again.

When a creature comes near enough to the **Bee Mine**, it explodes, spawning four regular **Bees** who are aggressive to whatever triggered the mine. Afterwards, the **Bees** behave identically to other hiveless **Bees**. If the **Bees** from the **Mine** are attacked by their target, other **Bees** from either **Bee Boxes** or **Bee Hives** will come to help. Surviving **Bees** will remain and can be caught with a **Bug Net** to make another mine. Catching them counts as aggression, and if there were others nearby assisting against the bomb target, those will attack the player, too.

**Bees**, **Killer Bees**, **Butterflies**, **Batilisks**, **Mosquitoes**, and **Shadow Creatures** cannot activate **Bee Mines**.

## Trivia
- The **Bee Mine** was added in the **The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You** update.
- In the **old research system**, its research cost was 100.
- Sometimes two **Bee Mines** will spawn next to a **Skeleton** as a **Set Piece**. These can be safely picked up.
- Placed **Bee Mines** have the option to be smashed with **Hammer**, with predictable results.

## Bugs
- Multiple **Bee Mines** can cause render

## Description
'''Cave Rock Turf''' is one of the [[Turf]] [[Items]], acquired by digging [[Cave Rock]] Turf tiles with a [[Pitchfork]]. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as [[Fire#Fuel|fuel]].

Similar in appearance to the [[Rocky Turf]], the Cave Rock Turf is often found on [[Stalagmite Terrain]] and in [[Rocky Plains]]. The difference between [[Rocky Turf]] and [[Cave Rock Turf]] is that Cave Rock Turf has more cracks along its surface.

[[Berry Bushes]], [[Grass Tufts]], [[Saplings]], [[Spiky Bush|Spiky Bushes]], [[Pine Cone|Pine Cones]], [[Birchnut|Birchnuts]], and [[Lureplants]] cannot be placed on [[Cave Rock]] turf, and Eyeplants will not grow on it.

Cave Rock Turf can be crafted and prototyped with 3 [[Rocks]] at [[Terra Firma Tamper]] in the [[Decorations Filter]].

# Battle Helm

The Battle Helm is a wearable **Armor** item for the head slot in the **Reign of Giants** DLC and is exclusive to **Wigfrid**. Wigfrid starts the game with it in her **Inventory** and is the only character able to craft it. It requires 2 **Gold Nugget**s and 2 **Rocks** to craft.

## Attributes

- **Damage Absorption**: 80% of incoming damage
- **Durability**: 750 hp
- **Water Resistance**: 20%
- **Image**: ![Battle Helm Dropped](File:Battle Helm Dropped.png)
- **Icon**: ![Battle Helm](File:Battle Helm.png)
- **Image Width**: 65

## Crafting

- **Ingredient 1**: Gold Nugget (x2)
- **Ingredient 2**: Rocks (x2)
- **Tab**: Fight
- **Tier**: 0

## Description

The unicorn is what protects you.

## Trivia

- Attempting to spawn this item in with a console command or crafting it with a modded crafting recipe when not playing as Wigfrid will result in the item instantly disappearing from the inventory.
- Willow's quote, "It's got a name scratched on the inside... "W", uh..." is a reference to the fact that every character's name starts with a W, even including Maxwell, which is in fact his stage name from better days; his real name is William Carter.
- Initially, Moonlight Diaden skin featured a star instead of Alter's symbol. It was changed presumably due to associations with the Star of David.
- Battle Helm was **Character-Specific** Item, but its changed in **Don't Starve Mega Update**.

Please refer to the [Farm Plant](Farm Plant) section.

The **Potato Plant** is an object exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the **Reap What You Sow** update.

Potato Plants are strong enough to tolerate any growing season that is not **Summer**, which will stress the plant. Potatoes are water-efficient plants that consume only 3.6 units of ground moisture per day. Potato Plants add 1 unit of Growth Formula and 1 unit of Compost while draining 2 units of Manure.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It still has the tail on it."
- Willow: "Ha ha. A pig's butt."
- Wolfgang: "Why long butt? Ha ha, Wolfgang is funny man."
- ... (and more quotes from other characters)

## Obtaining Pig Skin
A Pig Skin can be obtained by killing a Pig, Werepig, or Guardian Pig, or by deconstructing a Pig House with a Hammer or Deconstruction Staff or Pig Head with a Hammer. It is used to craft several items, such as the Football Helmet and Umbrella. Pig Skin is a "horrible" meat food item, which means that while the player refuses to eat it, Spiders and Pigs will see Pig Skin as food and will eat it if left on the ground. Additionally, it can be fed to Pigs to befriend them.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Pig Skin is required in two more recipes: Scalemail and Summer Frest. Also, although Webber is half Spider, he still finds Pig Skins inedible. In the Shipwrecked DLC, Pig Skin can be obtained from Wildbores and Wildbore Heads, which replace Pigs and Pig Heads, respectively. Pig Skin can also be used to craft Spyglasses and Wildbore Houses. Snakes will eat Pig Skin left on the ground.

## Pig Skin? (Hamlet DLC)
In the Hamlet DLC, Vampire Bats will drop an item called "Pig Skin?" (question mark included). It can be used to craft items with normal Pig Skin in their recipes. The Pig villagers will attempt to eat any Pig Skin? left on the ground. Either types of Pig skins will combine together in one stack, with the icon in the inventory representing the item that held the slot initially. Any Pig Skin? dropped by the effects of Hay Fever will drop as regular Pig Skin. The Pig Skin?'s spawn code is "bat_hide".

## Usage
Pig Skin can be used in various recipes to craft different items:
- Gold Nugget
- Saddle
- Football Helmet
- Umbrella
- Piggyback
- Ham Bat
- One-man Band
- Pig House
- Spectoggles (Wagstaff)

# Evergreens

## Overview
Evergreens are plants generated randomly with each new map and can be naturally found anywhere except in Rockyland or Savannah Biomes (although they may still be planted there). Evergreens are most commonly found in Forests and Grasslands.

## Attributes

- **Image Gallery:**
  ![Evergreen Tall](Evergreen.png)
  ![Evergreen Medium](Evergreen_Normal.png)
  ![Evergreen Short](Evergreen_Short.png)
  ![Evergreen Old](Old Evergreen.png)
  ![Evergreen Stump](Evergreen Stump.png)
  ![Evergreen Sapling](Evergreen Sapling.png)

- **Tool Interaction:** Can be Chopped with an Axe, Dug with a Shovel (when Sapling or Stump)
- **Can Be Burned:** Yes
- **Resources:**
  - Tall: 3 Logs, 2 Pine Cones, 1 Evergreen Stump
  - Medium: 2 Logs, 1 Pine Cone, 1 Evergreen Stump
  - Short: 1 Log, 1 Evergreen Stump
  - Old: 1 Pine Cone, 1 Evergreen Stump
  - Stump: 1 Log
  - Sapling: 1 Twigs

- **Renew:** Yes
- **Spawns:** Treeguard
- **Biome:** Forest, Grassland
- **Spawn Code:** "evergreen_tall", "evergreen_normal", "evergreen_short", "evergreen_stump"

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** "It's all piney."
- **Willow:** "It looks like it would burn well."
- **Wolfgang:** "Hello, tree!"
- **Wendy:** "Nature is so boring."
- **WX-78:** "TARGET ACQUIRED"
- **Wickerbottom:** "A generically coniferous tree."
- **Woodie:** "It's calling to me!"
- **Maxwell:** "I've heard them described as 'piney'."
- **Wagstaff:** "I deduce it's not one of the possessed kind."
- **Wigfrid:** "I feel at höme in the wööds."
- **Webber:** "Pines are always greener on the other side of the fence."
- **Walani:** "Reminds me of winter. Yuck."
- **Warly:** "A soldier of the exotic forest."
- **Woodlegs:** 'Tis some fine ship buildin' material."
- **Wilba:** 'TIS EVER GREENETH"
- **Wormwood:** "How doing, Friend?"
- **Wheeler:** "Well, it looks lifeless enough, but you never can tell."
- **Winona:** "Just a tree."
- **Wortox:** "A hearty tree of dark green leaves."
- **Wurt:** "Me ever-green too, florpt!"
- **Walter:** "They're called 'evergreen' because... well you get the idea."
- **Wanda:** "Just another tree."

## Growth and Life Cycle
Evergreens have a 4-stage life cycle (small, medium, large, and aged) which they continuously cycle through. The time for each stage to grow to the next one is, respectively, 0.625-1.25 days (5-10 min), 1.875-4.375 days (15-35 min), 1.875-4.375 days (15-35 min), and 0.3125-0.9375 days (2.5-7.5 min). Once cut, stumps do not regrow into trees nor do new trees spawn naturally; the only way to get more trees is to plant them with Pine Cones.

## Treeguards
When a tree is chopped down, a nearby Evergreen may stand up and become a Treeguard. After day 3, each tree felled has a 1.3% percent chance of spawning a Treeguard from a nearby Evergreen, including trees that have been planted by the player.

## Shelter and Protection
Standing under an Evergreen will provide shelter, granting 35% Wetness resistance, and preventing held Torches from being affected by Rain. If the player's temperature is greater than 63°, it will also provide a cooling effect of 45°.

## Burning
If a tree is exposed to fire, it will quickly ignite and can rapidly spread to nearby trees or other plants. Burning trees produce a great deal of light and heat, however they burn out quickly. Once a tree is consumed by fire

Both potions restore the players' Sanity both upon consumption and slowly over time. The Dram initially restores 5 Sanity upon consumption, while the Tumblerful restores 15 Sanity upon consumption. During the next minute, both potions restore 1 Sanity every two seconds, adding up to an additional restoration of 30. Both potions can also be used as Fire Fuel.

# Lake

- **Game**: Don't Starve Together
- **Introduced In**: A New Reign
- **Exclusive Feature**: Yes
- **Image Gallery**:
  - ![Full Lake](Lake.png)

- **Tool**: Can be fished using a ![Fishing Rod](Fishing Rod)

  - ![Crumpled Package](Crumpled Package)
- **Renewability**: Cannot be destroyed
- **Biome**: Desert
- **Spawn Code**: "oasislake"
- **Spawns**: ![Fireflies](Fireflies)

## Quotes

### When the lake is dry:
- Wilson: "It's dry as a bone."
- Warly: "There's nothing but mud."
- Wigfrid: "Naught but a barren basin."
- Maxwell: "It's not in season."
- Webber: "We can make mud pies!"
- Wendy: "If only my tears could dry up like this lake."
- Choose: Wendy

### When the lake is wet:
- Wilson: "Is that a mirage?"
- Warly: "I could use a little break."
- Wigfrid: "Perhaps a sword-wielding maiden lies beneath."
- Maxwell: "Didn't think I'd ever come back here."
- Webber: "That's a pretty lake!"
- Choose: Wendy

## Tips

- Making a small outpost near the Oasis can be beneficial as players may need to stay at the Lake for long periods of time to fish out the various rare Blueprints only obtainable through Crumpled Packages.
- The Oasis is also a viable place to build a Summer base, as plants and structures will not smolder and cause Wildfires throughout the entire surrounding Desert biome. This also gives players easy access to Cactus Flowers, Volt Goats, and the Antlion, as long as they have obtained Desert Goggles to counter the constant Sandstorm.
- The Lake may dry up after filling on the first day of Summer if it rains. Once rain stops falling, this unexpected change is reversed, and more Succulents can be gathered.
- The Lake will not fill up when something that isn't Fireflies is right on top of it, such as a player or an item that wasn't properly pushed away.

## Trivia

- The Lake was added in the Against The Grain update.
- Items dropped on the dried Lake will be pushed off to the edge so that they may still be picked up after it fills with water.
- The Lake is a renewable source of Fireflies such as surrounding area of the Great Tree Trunks.
- If the player begins fishing in the lake with zero fishes in it, the character will simply hold the rod indefinitely until the player cancels the action, even if the count of fishes becomes non-zero after the line has been cast.

## Bugs

- When the Lake fills up with water, some entities standing on it will persist doing so until they move away.

# Rain Coat

## Overview
The **Rain Coat** is a craftable **Dress** **Item** in Don't Starve. It requires 2 **Tentacle Spots**, 2 **Rope**, and 2 **Bone Shards** to craft and a **Science Machine** to prototype.

## Skins
- **Woven - Elegant**: Horned Gumshoe Poncho
  - "Stay dry while sleuthing."

## Tips
- The Rain Coat is a viable item to wear helmets such as **Miner Hat** while equipping tools or **weapons** without getting wet.

## Planting
A Fleshy Bulb is an item dropped by Lureplants when killed. When planted by the player, it will spawn a new Lureplant. If the newly spawned Lureplant is killed, it will also drop a Fleshy Bulb. Despite being plant material, Fleshy Bulbs cannot be eaten and do not spoil.

It will take 2 days for a freshly planted bulb to turn into an active Lureplant, and taking its lure will reset the Lureplant to its "just planted" state. Bulbs planted too close to each other will block the movement of the player and Mobs.

## Flammability
Fleshy Bulbs are flammable and can be used as fuel for Campfires and Fire Pits.

Moon Glass is a naturally-spawning object exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. It is found on the Lunar Island mostly in the Lunar Mine, Lunar Baths, and above Vitreoasis in Lunar Grotto Biomes. It can be mined for two Moon Shards and has a 25% chance to yield an extra one.

Vitreoasis full moon regeneration makes this resource renewable.

**Trivia:**
- Moon Glass was introduced in the Turn of Tides update.
- Judging by many quotes, these glasses are formed due to water saturated with lunar dirt. In the Scrapbook for Small Vitreoasis, it is already specified that this happens only in certain light.
