## Description
'''Rocky Turf''' is one of the [[Turf]] items, acquired by digging [[Rockyland]] tiles with a [[Pitchfork]]. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or it can be used as [[Fire#Fuel|fuel]]. Rocky Turf can be crafted and prototyped with 1 [[Rocks]] and 1 [[Flint]] at [[Terra Firma Tamper]] in the [[Decorations Filter]].

### Incompatibility
- [[Berry Bush]]es, [[Sapling]]s, [[Grass Tuft]]s, [[Spiky Bush]]es, [[Pine Cones]], and [[Birchnut]]s cannot be planted on Rocky Turf.
- [[Lureplant|Eyeplants]] cannot spawn on this Turf, making it great for planting [[Lureplant]] farms without additional resource expenditure.

### Bird Spawning
When placed on the [[Surface World]] and the area is large enough, [[Crow]]s are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs.

The **Catcoon** is a neutral **Mob** in the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC, spawning from a **Hollow Stump**. It will wander around, pouncing at small creatures and playing with various objects, sometimes destroying them. When killed, a Catcoon will drop **Meat** and has a 33% chance of dropping a **Cat Tail**. It will also give the player 5 points of **Naughtiness**, which may result in spawning Krampus.

When it sees a small **Bird**, **Rabbit**, **Moleworm**, **Butterfly**, or **Bee** within 12 **Tiles**, it will pounce on it and kill it. In addition to **Monsters**, Catcoons are aggressive towards **Pengull**s and **Grass Gekko**s and will attack them if they get close enough. This generally leads to the Catcoon being killed in retaliation. They will also attack other Catcoons, often committing an act of cannibalism when done. Catcoons will also attack a **Glommer**, even if players have befriended both, so caution should be taken. Catcoons are hostile to **Webber** and **Wortox** since they are considered as **Monsters**.

Catcoons will attempt to pick up "toys" within a 25 meter radius.

Whenever it starts **Rain**ing, any Catcoons that are outside will try to go back to their Hollow Stump.

Catcoons can be befriended by giving them "toys" or **food**, and they will give "gifts" to the player by coughing up items, such as **Rot** and **Cut Grass**, as if it is a hairball. Each item given to the Catcoon will add a tenth of a **day** (48 sec) to the time they spend following the player (up to a maximum of 1 day) and force the next hairball to be sooner. The item that they give depends on the number of times they hack before coughing it up. Currently, there are two lists for neutral and friendly Catcoons.

# Torch

- **Icon**: Torch.png
- **Image**: Torch Dropped.png
- **Tier**: 0

- **Wendy**: A tiny bulwark against the night.
- **WX-78**: PRIMITIVE LIGHT SOURCE
- **Wickerbottom**: An improvised handheld light.
- **Woodie**: Trees by torchlight.
- **Maxwell**: It keeps Charlie at bay.
- **Wagstaff**: Portable combustion. Direly needed in this environment.
- **Wigfrid**: Perfect for a nighttime assault.
- **Webber**: This should keep us safe.
- **Walani**: Take that, night!
- **Warly**: Not great for caramelizing creme brulee, but it will do for seeing.

## Crafting Recipes
### Inffroggles
- **Ingredients**:
  - Torch (x2)
  - Electrical Doodad (x1)
  - Spectoggles (x1)
- **DLC**: 
- **Character**: Wagstaff

### Boat Torch
- **Ingredients**:
  - Torch (x1)
  - Twigs (x2)
- **Tool**: Science Machine
- **DLC**: Shipwrecked

## Tips
- Lighting trees or other flammable objects on fire can extend the lifetime of the Torch, provide warmth in Winter, and allow working at night without improved light sources.

## Trivia
- The game files have contained code for a Torch's capability to give off warmth ever since Winter was implemented, however, this code has never actually been used.

## Bugs
- The sound which plays while holding a Torch may continue even after unequipping the Torch. Saving, exiting, and reloading the game seems to fix this.

# Bat Bat

## Overview
The **Bat Bat** is a **Magical** **Melee Weapon** in **Don't Starve**. It deals 42.5 damage per hit and has 75 uses. Each hit leeches 6.8 **Hp** from non-wall targets, but drains 3.4 **Sanity** from the player if they are not at full health.

## Crafting
The Bat Bat requires a **Shadow Manipulator** to prototype and the following materials to craft:
- 3 **Batilisk Wings**
- 2 **Living Logs**
- 1 **Purple Gem**

## Availability
Bat Bats may also be found in **Ornate Chests**, which appear in the **Ruins**.

## Tips
- The Bat Bat's leeching ability makes it ideal for fighting dangerous enemies that cannot be easily outrun, like numerous **Hounds** or giants (especially **Dragonfly**), while wearing armor.
- The Bat Bat is immensely useful for **Wormwood**, since it allows him to easily regain the health he cannot receive from healing foods.
- Batilisk Wings needed for Bat Bats can be farmed by setting up **Rabbit Hutches** near an open **Sinkhole**. The Bunnymen will come out at night and quickly kill any spawning **Batilisks**.
- A quick way to regain health is to attack **Chester**, **Packim Baggims**, **Ro Bin**, or **Hutch** with a Bat Bat, since their health regenerates quickly.
- **Maxwell**'s Sanity boost will make up for the Sanity lost from each hit when using this weapon. The health bonus is also welcome, since he has low max health.
- This weapon will heal a total of 510 HP while draining 255 Sanity in its lifetime. This is equal to 17 **Honey Poultices**, 25.5 **Healing Salves**, or 12.75 **Pierogi** or **Fishsticks**. In the absence of **Jellybeans**, the Bat Bat offers potent healing unaffected by spoilage.
- Because of its low damage output, frail durability, and healing utility, it is inadvisable to use this item as any other weapon. Rather, it is better off as a "sidearm" that one can swap to after losing health. Furthermore, it will drain sanity even if the user's health is full.
- Bat Bats spawned in the ruins can provide helpful healing, especially if the player is underprepared or has intentionally come early.

## Trivia
- The Bat Bat was introduced in the **It's Not a Rock!** update.
- The Bat Bat was the second weaponized food item added to the game, after the **Ham Bat**.

# Brainy Sprout

## Exclusivity: Shipwrecked

### Object Infobox
- **Image**: ![Brainy Sprout](File:Brainy Sprout.png)
- **Tool**: None
- **Resources**: 
  - Brainy Matter (![32px]({{pic32|Brainy Matter}})
  - Limestone x2 (![30px](File:Hammer.png|link=Hammer))
- **Renew**: No
- **Biome**: Coral Reef
- **Sanity Bonus**: +25/min (When glowing)
- **Spawn Code**: "coral_brain_rock"

### Quotes
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang's brain will punch this brain."
- Wilson: "I wonder what it's plotting..."
- Willow: "Genius idea, hiding out with these dumb regular corals."
- Woodie: "What're you, some sort of keener?"
- Maxwell: "I wonder what it's thinking?"
- Wagstaff: "A neurological network of nautical knowledge!"
- Wendy: "That's one smart-looking plant."
- Woodlegs: "Th'brains o'th'ocean."
- Wickerbottom: "Mussidae Brainus."
- Webber: "I want to poke it, but I'm afraid our hand will get stuck."
- Warly: "Chewy rock, with a clever finish."
- WX78: "HIGHLY EVOLVED CORAL VARIETAL"
- Walani: "That is an impressive piece of coral."
- Wigfrid: "A mystical, all-knöwing water röck!"
- Wilba: 'TIS ROCK HATH SMARTS
- Wormwood: "Thinky rock"
- Wheeler: "Sure it has a bigger brain than me, but I have the bigger heart."
- Choose: Wilson

The **Brainy Sprout** is a **Plant** spawning near **Coral Reefs** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. When picked, it will yield **Brainy Matter**, and will grow back 20 days after being picked.

If not picked, it will glow at **Dusk** and **Night**, providing enough light to ward off **Charlie**. While glowing it also has a **Sanity** aura.

The sprout can be permanently destroyed with a hammer for two **Limestone** and a Brainy Matter if it is not already picked.

### Tips
- The Brainy Sprout’s sanity aura has a very short range requiring the player to sail directly adjacent to it in order to benefit from the bonus sanity. If planning to build a **Sea Yard** nearby, it would need to be very close to the sprout for its repair range to overlap with the sanity aura.
- It is useful to store Brainy Matter in a **Bundling Wrap** to prevent it from spoiling.

### Trivia
- Their brain shape and the fact that they spawn in the reef biome could be a reference to **brain coral** (*Diploria labyrinthiformis*).

## Tips
1. Three Houndius Shootius can kill a Deerclops or a Moose/Goose with minimal help from the player. If the Deerclops cycles between them rather than focusing on one, it is possible that none will be destroyed.
2. Despite its name, it can be useful for much more than just Hound attacks.
3. If a player attacks a turret, other turrets will begin to attack it. Turrets will continue to fire at each other until one of them is destroyed or distracted.
4. The Houndius Shootius can be used in conjunction with a Bat Bat to heal quickly; its high Health and passive regeneration makes it ideal to attack and heal (at the cost of Sanity).
5. The Houndius Shootius is an excellent item to use to defend the player against Hounds over day 100. However, the player could be swarmed before the Houndius Shootius kills the hounds, so making 2 will be sufficient enough.
6. Players can use multiple Houndius Shootius to farm different Mobs penned inside Walls. Good examples of this are Bunnymen and Vargs.
7. A Houndius Shootius can be used to kill Birds cost-free. Paired with a Feather Hat, players can easily farm Morsels and Feathers.
8. Bee Boxes should be placed a good distance away from the Houndius Shootius, as the angry Bees that come out of a harvested Bee Box will be attacked and killed, slowing Honey gathering.
9. Players can use the Hostile Flare to fight Deerclops more than once per Winter season, with the goal to acquire more than one Deerclops Eyeball.

## Trivia
- The Houndius Shootius was first added to Don't Starve in the A Moderately Friendly Update.
- The Houndius Shootius bears a resemblance to an Obelisk of Light from Command & Conquer.
- The Houndius Shootius was originally called "Minotaur Clopper". This was changed to "Mino-Clopper

# Morning Star
The Morning Star is a melee weapon from the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC. It requires 1 Volt Goat Horn, 2 Electrical Doodads, and 2 Nitre to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Unlike most other weapons, the Morning Star doesn't lose durability when it strikes. Instead, it loses durability constantly while held. It also emits light while equipped. The Morning Star can do either 43.35 or 72.25 damage.

- Walter: "Whose bright idea was this? Get it? Because it's bright? Never mind."
- Wanda: "A light up weapon? What will they think of next!"
- Choose: Wigfrid

## Tips
- Striking an uncharged Volt Goat with the Morning Star will charge it. This can be useful if the player is hunting for Electric Milk.
- Because of the wetness modifier, this weapon is most useful during Spring, due to the abundance of rain.
- During Spring, the Morning Star can prove very useful in the Caves and Ruins as it provides light and does a high amount of damage.
- In Don't Starve Together, the following enemies are permanently wet, making the Morning Star the strongest melee weapon against them regardless of weather:
  - Depths Worms;
  - All varieties of Tentacles;
  - Merms.
- While the Morning Star is the equippable item with the largest radius of light, it's not recommended to use it as a light source due to the supplies required to craft it.

## Trivia
- In the real world, morning stars are medieval spiked clubs resembling maces.
- The Morning Star's base damage is 28.9, but since it is electrical, it gains a 1.5x modifier, bringing it to 43.35 damage. Additionally, if the target the player is attacking is wet (has a Wetness prefix), there will be an additional 1x modifier for a total of 2.5x. This means that the Morning Star can do either 43.35 or 72.25 damage (when used by characters with normal damage modifiers).
- The spawn code for a Morning Star is "nightstick". In real life, a nightstick is a police officer's club or billy.

## Scrapbook Info
Cobblestones can be placed on dirt ground to change the type of ground.

Cobblestones are a craftable Turf Item found in the Decorations filter. Cobblestone turf is crafted in sets of 4 which require 1 Cut Stone, and 2 Flint to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as fuel.

Cobblestones allow players to lay down their own Roads. Similar to natural Roads, they will speed up the player by 30%. Unlike natural Roads, Cobblestones can be moved using the Pitchfork. Small patches of it can be found in Mosaic biomes.

Plants like Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Pine Cones, and Birchnuts can't be planted on these Turfs, unless they were planted before the Turfs were placed. It will also stop the Lureplants' Eyeplants from spawning.

When placed on the Surface World covering a large enough area, Crows are the only Birds that will spawn and land on these turfs.

## Trivia
- Before the introduction of Stone Road Turf in the Hamlet DLC, Cobblestones were the only craftable Turf that provides a faster movement speed.
- Before Cobblestones were implemented, players were able to dig up Road Turf.

# Ancient Chest

The **Ancient Chest** is a structure exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, naturally spawning in the **Ruins** next to an **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**. It works similar to a **Chest**, but has 6 slots instead of 9, and cannot be destroyed.

## Use

The Ancient Chest's use is to input items to receive **Replica Relic** **Blueprints**, or solve the **Metheus Puzzles**.

When inserting items, the chest will rumble about for 5 seconds, then will open and either spit out the items that had been inserted if the order was incorrect, or consume the items and spit out the Blueprint if it was correct. If the Metheus Puzzles were solved, the chest will consume the items and not open. A notice on the top of one's screen will state: **Metheus has taken heed**.

## Description
Suspicious Bubbles are a feature found in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC in the **Medium** or **Deep Ocean** **Biome**. They are similar in function to the **Suspicious Dirt Pile** of regular **Don't Starve**. They can be investigated which will reveal a trail leading to a **Whale**.

Upon investigating the bubbles, a line of small bubbles will "pop" at the surface of the water in a particular direction, leading towards the next set of Suspicious Bubbles. After 6 to 12 Suspicious Bubbles are successfully investigated, the character will alert the player that the creature is close and a Whale will be found in the indicated direction, rather than another bubble. If the Suspicious Bubbles are not investigated in time, they will disappear. However, new Suspicious Bubbles can be encountered later to start a new hunt. Suspicious Bubble trails lead to a **Blue Whale** most of the time, and a hostile **White Whale** the remainder of the time. The chance of finding a White Whale instead of a Blue Whale starts at 5% and increases over time to 33%.

A beta of the event started on June 12, 2018, and ran until the official event went live on June 14, 2018. On July 6, 2018, [The Gorge Tournament](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/93159-the-gorge-event-extended/) was announced which offered prizes including exclusive Portrait Frames and Profile Icons. After the event ended on July 17, 2018, Klei Entertainment published several official [statistics](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/93685-the-gorge-stats-and-info/).

## Official Description

After barely escaping through the Molten Gateway, our survivors plummet headfirst into the ruins of a sickly city ruled by a ravenous beast. Work together to cook fine dishes and placate the Eternal Gnaw's hunger to avoid the curse of its terrible plague. Cook well enough, and you may even get to go home.

- **Game Mode Description**: Cook delicious dishes to appease the Eternal Gnaw in this Gate Realm.

### Setting Up

Players could join other players either via Quick Match or by manually browsing available servers. Alternatively, a player could request a custom server via Custom Match, allowing them to set the server's name, description, password and whether or not it was associated with a Steam Group. All Gorge matches took place on specially dedicated servers, and as such, players could host their own Gorge servers.

It was not necessary to have a full set of three players to start a match, though it was recommended to do so. A round would begin either when all three player slots were filled up, or when all players in an incomplete party voted to begin without the full three.

## Description
Striking Statues are variants of the Striking Carving Trap in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC that take the form of a small pig. Like those, they are only found in the Ancient Pig Ruins and triggered when Lost Relics in the room are chiseled or mined, or when the player steps on a Pressure Plate. In addition to shooting Blow Darts which have 34 damage each, these statues start to rotate clockwise when triggered.

Striking Statues can be disarmed using Disarming Tools and dropping a Blow Dart, but can also be destroyed with a Hammer, dropping a few Rocks. Attempting to hammer a trap will trigger it, if it has not been triggered already.

- A Set Piece can be found with a lone Cargo Boat that contains a Spear Gun, a Spear, and 3 Morsels, but if the player gets on the boat, 3 Sea Hounds will spawn and attack the player. Depending on when the player has found the boat, the Morsels may spoil and become Rot.

The **Stone Plug** is a Naturally spawning **Structure** exclusive to **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It is a unique object which can exclusively be found inside the BFB's Caves; it mainly acts as an obstacle which has to be mined in order to exit these caves.

Once the player has been transported to the **BFB's Nest**, its only way to escape the island is to mine the **Sinkhole** on its surface, and enter the Caves just below. These Caves contain many rooms, and a Stone Plug will be present in the back wall of one of them, which the player will have to mine with a **Pickaxe** or **Opulent Pickaxe** in order to exit them. This will lead the player to one of the **Cave Clefts** on one of the four other islands, and only then, to the surface.

It takes 6 hits to be mined, and will have a chance to yield **Rocks**, **Flint**, and **Nitre**.

# Rot

## Description
Rot is produced when food items (excluding Eggs) spoil. It can be used as Fertilizer for Farming or as a source of Fuel. Rot is as effective as Manure in fertilizing transplanted Grass Tuft and Berry Bush; otherwise, it is inferior to Manure in all other cases as fertilizer or fuel.

## Properties
- **Food Type**: Generic
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes
- **Icon**: Rot.png
- **Image**: Rot Dropped.png
- **Crafting**: Spoiling Food
- **Hunger Restored**: -10
- **HP Restored**: -1
- **Stack**: 40
- **Burn Time**: 15 sec (Fire), 30 sec (Campfire, Fire Pit)
- **Sanity Restored**: 0
- **Perk**: Fertilizer and Fuel
- **Spawn Code**: spoiled_food
- **Dropped By**: Most perishable items (×1), Merman (Hammer), Ham (A Smashing Pot, Hammer) (7%)

## Quotes
- Wolfgang: Is ball of yuck!
- Wilson: It's a furry ball of rotten food.
- Willow: At least it's still flammable.
- Woodie: Aw, it's Diefenbakered.
- Maxwell: That used to be food until I wasted it.
- Wagstaff: No longer ideal for consuming.
- Wendy: Everything turns to waste, eventually.
- Woodlegs: Bin eaten worse.
- Wickerbottom: It is heavy with bacteria.

- Wormwood: Not good for belly
- Wheeler: Am I really that desperate for adventure?

## Downloadable Content
Bees in the player's inventory can be fed with Rot.

## Usage
- **Compost Wrap Recipe**: 2 Rot + 5 Manure + Nitre

## Tips
- A quick way to obtain Rot is to leave Roasted Berries or Fish in a chest as they spoil very quickly.
- WX-78 can eat spoiled food without penalties, but will still be damaged by eating Rot.
- A Tallbird Nest near a Rabbit Hole is a good source of Rot.
- If the player has access to Caves, they can also pick Light Flowers for Light Bulbs. These will rot just as fast as Petals (in 6 days).

## Trivia
- Fertilizer properties: 4 Rot = 1 Manure; 5 Rot = 1 Guano.
- Rot originally looked like a blue ball. Though the texture is now a misshapen blob, multiple characters still refer to it as a "ball".
- The food with the shortest perish time is Lichen, turning to Rot after just 2 days. The food with the longest perish time is the Powdercake, which turns to Rot after 18,750 days.

Debris can be destroyed with a **Hammer** to yield 3 **Logs** and 1 **Boat Repair Kit**. This allows the player to repair their boats before they gain access to a **Science Machine** or **Stingers**, which are required to craft the Boat Repair Kit. Once destroyed, the debris will not respawn.

## Scrapbook Info
Slurtle Slime will explode for 50 damage when lit. Also fuels Lanterns and Miner Hats.

**Slurtle Slime** is a Mob-dropped item. It is produced by Slurtles and Snurtles after eating certain Minerals, and also dropped when they are killed. It is very explosive and can trigger Earthquakes when ignited. It deals 50 damage per charge (It can be exploded in stacks) and is a very good alternative to Gunpowder as it can be easily farmed by feeding Slurtles minerals, though it deals less damage on exploding. Additionally, it can be used to refuel a Lantern or a Miner Hat by 9.5%.

## Downloadable Content

### Shipwrecked DLC
In the Shipwrecked DLC, Slurtle Slime can be used to destroy Obsidian Boulders, as well as refuel a Bottle Lantern or a Boat Lantern; in a linked Don't Starve or Reign of Giants world.

### Hamlet DLC
In the Hamlet DLC, Slurtle Slime can be used to destroy Suspicious Cracks in the Ancient Pig Ruins; in a linked Don't Starve or Reign of Giants world.

## Trivia
- This item may be explosive because Slurtles and Snurtles consume Nitre, an ingredient for explosives like Gunpowder.
- When the player becomes insane, Slurtle Slime will appear to be grayish blue.

- **Checkerboard Flooring**: Requires 1 Marble and an Alchemy Engine.
- **Marble Suit**: Requires 12 Marble and 4 Rope, and an Alchemy Engine.

# Pure Horror

**Pure Horror** is a resource exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It appears to be a stronger variant of **Nightmare Fuel**. Before **Shadow Rift**s are activated, the only source of Pure Horror is the **Nightmare Werepig**, which drops 4-5 upon its defeat.

Once Shadow Rifts are open, **Fused Shadeling**s are the most efficient way of farming Pure Horror, dropping 3-4 each. **Ink Blight**s drop a smaller amount of Pure Horror as well, but cannot be killed as often. The **Resting Horror** also drops 1 Pure Horror if Shadow Rifts have been activated.

Pure Horror is used to craft the **Dreadstone Helm** and **Dreadstone Armor**, as well as the **Shadowcraft Plinth** and all of the items craftable at said station in the **Shadowcrafting Filter**. It can also refuel anything fueled by Nightmare Fuel at twice the efficiency. For example, the durability of **Bone Armor** is restored by 50% per Pure Horror, rather than the usual 25% per Nightmare Fuel.

**Wilson** with the **Shadow Courtier** Skill can craft 2 Pure Horror with 1 **Dreadstone**, as well as use 3 Pure Horror to craft 1 Dreadstone, or use 1 Pure Horror to craft 2 Nightmare Fuel.

## Downloadable Content

In the Hamlet DLC, Nightmare Amulets can be bought for 50 Oincs at The Flying Pig Arcane Shop in the Pig City.

## Tips

- This item can be useful for collecting items that are only available at low Sanity levels, such as Beard Hair and Nightmare Fuel, while still being able to opt out of the dangers of insanity at will.
- This item can be especially useful when playing as Maxwell, since not only does his Sanity regeneration make it hard to go insane the normal way, but it also mitigates the Sanity loss caused by the Amulet.
- Using the Nightmare Amulet to its full potential to farm Nightmare Fuel can yield around 20-24 Nightmare Fuel.
- The Nightmare Amulet will almost always spawn a Shadow Creature upon equipping it. Paired with a low Sanity level, this can be utilized to spawn Shadow Creatures, and unequipping the amulet will not despawn them. This can be used to obtain more Nightmare Fuel.
- The Nightmare amulet can be used to lower your lunacy on the lunar island.

## Trivia

- The Nightmare Amulet shares the same in-game model with Magiluminescence, but its gem is purple instead of yellow.
- Prior to the The Stuff Of Nightmares update, the Nightmare Amulet actually restored 2 Sanity per minute, instead of reducing it.
- This item was previously crafted from the Gemology Tab before the latter was removed from the game.
- The gem in the Nightmare Amulet has eight corners, however the Purple Gems used to craft it only have six.
- According to Wickerbottom and Maxwell, the Nightmare Amulet communicates with the shadows.
- Eating a Grim Galette while wearing a Nightmare Amulet will instantly kill the player due to its effects.

# Intricate Topiaries
Intricate Topiaries are structures exclusive to the **Hamlet** DLC, spawning naturally in the **Pig City** biome. There are 4 different topiaries, each of which may spawn with their own "build" of surrounding structures (as a **Set Piece** would).

The Intricate Topiaries can be destroyed with a **hammer**, however they do not get fully removed. They can be repaired again by the player using a **hammer**, or by a nearby **worker** Pig.

To fully remove the Intricate Topiary, one must obtain the **Executive Hammer** from the **Palace**. There is currently no way to reconstruct the Intricate Topiaries.

## Trivia
* According to **Rhymes with Play** #213, the designs of the Intricate Topiaries might be lore-relevant.

## Usage

The Pitchfork is a tool used for digging up Turfs in Tile-sized chunks. It requires 2 Twigs and 2 Flint to craft and a Science Machine to prototype.

Once the Pitchfork is equipped, a square outline will appear on the ground showing the patch that the cursor is hovering over, along with a prompt. Right-clicking will dig up the outlined terrain, leaving a barren patch in its place. Turf items can only be placed on this sort of barren terrain.

The Pitchfork has 200 uses (800 for snazzy pitchfork), which means that each time it digs up a turf, it will lose 0.5% durability. It can also be used as a weapon which deals 17 damage but suffers higher durability loss per hit (4%).

In Don't Starve, a Turf's instant availability and decent fuel value, coupled with the Pitchfork's high durability and speed, makes Turfs one of the easiest options for fueling Campfires and Fire Pits. Turfs are not renewable, however. In Don't Starve Together, Turfs have a significantly lower burn time (7.5s instead of 45s), making it a weak method for fueling, although it can be used in the same way as Pine Cones in that the player will likely have an excess of them for no other purpose than fuel.

Dug up Turf can be replaced with other kinds of Turfs (e.g. Wooden Flooring). This is useful for decoration or for preventing Lureplants and Eyeplants from spawning.

The digging animation for the Pitchfork can be cut short by moving after the player digs up anything. This speeds up the process of mass-clearing turf when holding spacebar.

## Downloadable Content

In the Hamlet DLC, Pitchforks can be bought for 5 Oincs at the Pigg and Pigglet's General Store. Pitchforks cannot dig up Deep Rainforest or Gas Rainforest Turfs and will lose all durability if it digs up Gas Rainforest Turfs.

## Trivia

- Shovels were previously used to dig up Turfs.
- The Pitchfork was added in the Progress! update.
- It previously cost 30 Science Points to craft and had a value of 1-10 Science Points depending on its durability.
- The player is able to dig the special

The highest damage is 59.5 when fresh, and the damage decreases by about 0.37 per minute or 2.975 per day until it reaches its lowest damage of 29.75, just before turning into Rot. It becomes weaker than a Tentacle Spike after 2.86 days, weaker than a Battle Spear after 5.71 days, and on the 8.67th day, it's about as powerful as a Spear.

The Ham Bat will last longer when put into an Ice Box, Insulated Pack, Sea Sack, Chef Pouch, and Snow Chester.

## Tips

- Having four spare Monster Meat, feeding them to a Pig (resulting in it turning into a Werepig) and then slaying the Werepig can result in the player receiving all of the necessary ingredients needed for crafting, excluding the Twigs.
- The unlimited uses make it ideal for dealing damage to mobs and entities that don't fight back, like Spider Den and Snurtles.
- It is also an efficient weapon against Bosses due to their large Health pools.
- It's more effective to craft the Ham Bat in Winter because during that season spoilage rate is reduced by 25%.
- The Ham Bat can be crafted from spoiled meat and will be fully fresh when crafted. This makes it handy to be crafted right before a fight.
- Player can use a Bundling Wrap to contain and preserve large amounts of Meat for indefinite time, allowing them to always have the possibility of crafting Ham Bats without the need of hunting for Meat beforehand.

## Trivia

- The Ham Bat was added in the "A Little Rain Must Fall" update.
- The Ham Bat makes an appearance as the [Ham

## Description
**Checkerboard Flooring** is a craftable **Turf Item**. It requires 1 **Marble** to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as **fuel**.

Checkerboard Flooring spawns around the **Wooden Thing**, in the **Chess** **biome**, and in various **Set Pieces**. 

**Eyeplants** cannot spawn on Checkerboard Flooring, making it an expensive and artificial way of protecting oneself from **Lureplants**. Plants like **Berry Bushes**, **Grass Tufts**, **Saplings**, **Spiky Bushes**, **Pine Cones**, and **Birchnut**s can't be planted on these turfs, unless they were planted before the turfs were placed.

When placed on the **Surface World** in a large enough area, Crows are the only **Birds** that will spawn and land on Checkerboard Flooring.

Caution is advised when looking for this type of Turf, as the Clockwork Monsters can provide a challenge to unprepared players that are attempting to collect it.

## Trivia
- Checkerboard Flooring was added in the **[A Little Rain Must Fall](Version History#A Little Rain Must Fall)** update.
- Despite being crafted from Marble, it can be used as fuel like the other Turfs.
- When walking on Checkerboard Flooring, a distinct ambient sound can be heard, similar to the one near an assembled **Wooden Thing**.

# Red Cap

## Overview

The **Red Cap** is a **Veggie** food item that can be harvested from **Red Mushrooms** or **Red Mushtrees**. Eating it raw will restore 12.5 **Hunger** at the cost of 20 **hp**, making it unviable as a major food source for every character except for **Wormwood**, whose Health is unaffected by food. Red Caps are a viable last resort against starvation since 12.5 **Hunger** will delay starvation by long enough to make up for the 20 **hp** penalty. Red Caps can be used as a **Crock Pot** filler without any health penalty. Red Caps can be dropped on the ground to indirectly damage **Mobs** if they eat it.

### Properties

## Cooked Red Cap

The **Cooked Red Cap** is a **Vegetable** Food item made by **Cooking** a Red Cap on a fire (Campfire, Fire Pit, or a Dwarf Star). Unlike its raw counterpart, the Cooked Red Cap will not deduct any health points, instead restoring 1 **hp**. However, it will now take away 10 **Sanity** instead, while restoring no hunger. The Cooked Red Cap can also be used as fuel.
