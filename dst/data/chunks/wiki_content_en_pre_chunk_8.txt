## Description
A **Shattered Spider Hole** is a naturally occurring **Structure**, exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in **Return of Them**. It spawns **Shattered Spiders**. Unlike a regular **Spider Den**, a **Pickaxe** is used to break it down, and it provides **Rocks**, **Silk**, **Moon Shard**s, and **Moon Rock**s.

Shattered Spider Holes go through three growth stages, containing 2, 3, and 4 Shattered Spiders, respectively. They are found exclusively in the **Lunar Forest** and **Rocky Beach** **Biomes** on the **Lunar Island**.

## Trivia
- The Shattered Spider Hole was introduced in the **Turn of Tides** update.
- The Shattered Spider hole appears to be a **Spider Queen** that has been encased in **Moon Rock**. Additionally, it appears that the Queen is still alive, as the legs can be occasionally seen to twitch.

# Carcass

Carcasses are the dead bodies of creatures existing in the world. As a rule, most of them appear after killing a certain mob under certain conditions. However, they all have different properties.

## Whale Carcass
### White Whale Carcass
**Exclusive to Shipwrecked**

- **Dropped by**: ![White Whale](White Whale.png)
- **Name**: White Whale Carcass
- **Image**: ![White Whale Carcass](White Whale Carcass.png)
- **Drops**: 4 Raw Fish, 4 Blubber, 1 Harpoon, 1 Bone Shards, 3-9 Other Random Items

```plaintext
spawnCode: "whale_carcass_white"
```

When killed, White Whale Carcass is dropped, which will take 3–5 days to fully bloat (only if it has been loaded once during that play session). When bloated, it can be popped with a Machete and will explode, dropping the aforementioned items.

### Blue Whale Carcass

- **Dropped by**: ![Blue Whale](Blue Whale.png)
- **Name**: Blue Whale Carcass
- **Image**: Blue Whale Carcass.png
- **Image Width**: 200
- **Drops**: 4 Raw Fish, 4 Blubber, 3-9 Other Random Items

```plaintext
spawnCode: "whale_carcass_blue"
```

Slain Blue Whales don't immediately drop items, instead becoming a carcass when killed. The carcass will go through 3 stages: Bloated stage 1 (recently killed, withered, and rotting), bloated stage 2 (larger, emits more smell), and bloating stage 3 (severely deformed, shaking softly). During stages 2 and 3, the Blue Whale Carcass will create a squeaking sound that can be heard from about 8 boat lengths away. The Blue Whale Carcass will take 3-5 days to fully bloat (only if it has been loaded once during that play session). When bloated, it can be popped with a Machete and it will explode, dropping 4 Raw Fish, 4 Blubber, and 9 other random items. 

There is a tricky problem post-hunting: picking up all the items dropped may turn out to be difficult. The dropped Raw Fish are highly possible to trigger Sea Hound/Crocodog spawning. Player may be overwhelmed by a large amount of these monsters, and cannot pick up the raw fish and blubber before the monsters eating all of them, making all the effort paid on hunting in vain. A possible way to solve this problem is preparing Sea Wall before popping the bloated carcass. Encircle the area so that spawned monsters cannot get close. After picking up the rewards safely, one may break out of the wall, fight the monsters or simply leave if fighting is not desired.

The **Bulbous Lightbug** is a passive [Mob] exclusive to [Don't Starve Together]. It spawns from a special variant of [Light Flower]s found in the [Lunar Grotto] biome.

Bulbous Lightbugs emit light with a small radius. They follow players that have other Bulbous Lightbugs in their inventory. Up to 3 Bulbous Lightbugs can follow the same player. They stop following if they are attacked or if the player drops all the Bulbous Lightbugs in their [Inventory].

If a Bulbous Lightbug dies or is too far away from its spawn point, the corresponding Light Flower takes 12 [day]s to respawn another one.

The Bulbous Lightbug can be caught with a [Bug Net]. It starves in 2 days unless fed with [Vegetables] or [Light Bulb]s.

Dropping a captured Lightbug will free it.

Unlike regular Bulbous Lightbugs, these are smaller and their bulbs are green. They create light and orbit around their summoner. One summoned Lightbug allows Wormwood to avoid damage from [Darkness]; however, two or more are needed to negate the sanity loss from it.

After 20 minutes (2.5 in-game days), or if killed, they turn back into a Light Bulb.

These creatures cannot drop souls.

## Tips
- Bulbous Lightbugs can be brought to the surface via the Inventory. Once released, they will hover around a specific area indefinitely, providing an infinite light source as long as they are not killed.
- Bulbous Lightbugs can make excellent pets: they provide infinite light as stated, can be kept in the inventory, circle around the player, and don't need to be fed, unlike the [Critters|Mothling].

## Trivia

**Choose**: Woodlegs

---

The **Lucky Hat** is a craftable **item** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, exclusive to **Woodlegs**. It can be found in the **Nautical Tab** and requires 4 **Bone Shards**, 3 **Cloth**, and 10 **Dubloons** to be crafted. While equipped, it will reveal a new **X Marks the Spot** treasure every 800 seconds (slightly more than 1 Day and a half).

This is based on the changes to the durability, so removing and re-equipping the hat will not reduce or increase this time. If worn by a non-Woodlegs character, such as a **Wildbore**, a **Prime Ape**, or any character besides Woodlegs, it only has a 66% chance to spawn a treasure. **Sewing Kits** repair its durability by 50%.

## Trivia

* Lucky Hat was a **Character-Specific** Item, but it changed in the **Don't Starve Mega Update**.

# Mysterious Energy

**Exclusivity:** Don't Starve Together

## Object Info

- **Image:** Mysterious Energy.png
- **Spawn Code:** `moon_altar_link`
- **Spawn From:** Reunited [[Celestial Altar]] [[Celestial Tribute]] [[Celestial Sanctum]]

## Quotes

- **Wilson:** "It must be building up to something."
- **Willow:** "Aw c'mon! What is it?!"
- **Wolfgang:** "Maybe little light ball needs time to get mightier?"
- **Wendy:** "Is something hiding in there?"
- **WX-78:** "LOADING..."
- **Wickerbottom:** "I'm afraid its purpose eludes me, for now."
- **Woodie:** "It's givn' me the heebie jeebies."

- **Wurt:** "What inside? Wanna see!"
- **Walter:** "What is it? Aaah, the suspense!"
- **Wanda:** "Can you feel that crackle of possibility in the air?"

The **Mysterious Energy** is an object exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in **Return of Them**. It appears once the [[Celestial Altar]], [[Celestial Tribute]], and [[Celestial Sanctum]] are built at less than 5 tiles or 20 units away from each other.

After spawning, the Mysterious Energy will release a pulse, completely replacing the current day with a [[Moon Cycle|Full Moon]] and causing [[Moonstorm|moonstorms]] to appear on the map. During these full moons, [[Enlightenment]] will replace [[Sanity]].

While the Mysterious Energy is active, the three Celestial Altars cannot be removed from their [[Celestial Fissure|Celestial Fissures]]. Attempting to hammer the Altars will damage the player in a similar fashion to the [[Nightmare Throne]], but will not destroy their tool.

For the Mysterious Energy itself, its only purpose is to allow the player to build [[Lunar Siphonator]] on it, to summon the [[Celestial Champion]].

## Tips

- The [[Lunar Island]] always contains a set piece with 3 [[Celestial Fissure]]s grouped together.
- The pieces must be placed on the main lunar island and not the smaller satellite islands.

## Trivia

- The Mysterious Energy was introduced in the **Return of Them#Forgotten Knowledge|Forgotten Knowledge** update. It was fully revealed in the **Return of Them#Eye of the Storm|Eye of the Storm** update.
- The construction tape around the Mysterious Energy was similar to that around the **Ancient Gateway** before it was functional.

## Description

A Touch Stone is always surrounded by 4 **Pig Heads**. The Pig Heads are not needed for the Touch Stone to function and can safely be deconstructed using a **Hammer**. The **Wooden Flooring** can also be taken without affecting the Touch Stone's usability.

When a Touch Stone is activated (by clicking on it), a small platform will rise out of the ground. After being revived on the platform, the Touch Stone will be destroyed by a lightning strike, dropping 2 **Rocks**, 2 **Marble**, and 1 **Nightmare Fuel**. **WX-78** will become overcharged by the lightning during the resurrection.

Unless another Touch Stone or revival item is found, the next death will cause **Game Over**, which will require the player to restart from scratch.

By default, there are two Touch Stones per world. Touch Stones can spawn in Caves but not **Ruins**. Both Touch Stones can be activated at the same time. The player will always respawn at the closest resurrection device.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, Touch Stones have the same function, and differences are due to item replacements in the DLC. Instead of Pig Heads, a Touch Stone is surrounded by **Wildbore Heads**. Using the stone to resurrect will yield **Limestone** instead of **Marble**.

In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, Touch Stones are not present in the world.

## Resurrection

Below are listed player's stats upon revival:

- **Health** is set to 50
- **Hunger** is set to 2/3 of maximum
- **Sanity** is set to 1/2 of maximum
- Penalties that normally afflict the player upon death and in other revival circumstances, such as empty **inventory** (items can be recovered at the place of death, as long as they haven't been destroyed by any means) and reset of most **character** abilities (**Wilson** and **Webber** will be beardless).

## Tips

- Being revived by the Touch Stone does not put any nearby Mobs to sleep.
- Placing a **Campfire** and a chest (or two) near the Touch Stone can increase chances of survival after being resurrected.

## Trivia

- Touch Stones are one of three methods of **resurrection**; the others being the **Meat Effigy** and the **Life Giving Amulet**.
- A Touch Stone cannot be **Hammer**ed or destroyed by mobs (e.g. **

- Willow: Trading diagrams is for dorks.
- Wolfgang: Picture will help Wolfgang carve nice rocks!
- Wendy: I think we could make what's drawn here...

- Wanda: An art project? Do I really have time for that?

## Description
Sketches are Don't Starve Together exclusive items, introduced in A New Reign. They can be given to a Potter's Wheel to unlock a specific Chess Piece for crafting. Once the sketch is given to a Potter's Wheel, the figure becomes available to any player near the Potter's Wheel. Note that destroying a Potter's Wheel which has taken any Sketches will also drop the Sketches. Sketches can be erased at a Cartographer's Desk to get one Papyrus. All Sketches have a fuel value of 15 seconds.

To obtain Sketches for Pawn Figures and Queenly Figures, one needs to mine Marble Statues. For Kingly Figure Sketch, Maxwell Statue. For Rook, Bishop, and Knight Figure Sketches, Marble Sculpture of matching type (Note that Marble Sculptures need Suspicious Marble to be repaired and then to be mined at Full Moon or New Moon to drop the sketch).

Performing each of the above actions will unlock the respective chess piece in the world. This allows for the matching trinket or sketch to be found in Tumbleweeds. Chess piece trinkets may be traded with the Pig King to obtain its corresponding sketches.

The Boss Monster Sketches are dropped when the corresponding Boss Monster is killed. Except that Frostjaw Sketch is dropped when traded with heavy Ocean Fish.

The Sketch itself is just about the shape of the piece to be crafted, the color of the crafted pieces will be determined based on the materials used to craft it, where using Marble results in a white piece, using Cut Stone results in a black piece, and using a Moon Shard results in a glassy blue piece.

## Available Figures
The following Chess Pieces can be unlocked from their corresponding Sketches:

| Sketch | Obtained by | Sketch as Item |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Pawn Figure (Marble)] | Mining Marble Pawn.png |  |
| ![Queenly Figure (Marble)] | Mining Marble Comedy.png, Marble Tragedy.png |  |

# Sawhorse
The Sawhorse is a craftable **Structure** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**. It requires 4 **Boards** and 4 **Flint** to craft after acquiring its rare **Blueprint** from the **Crabby Hermit** by placing a **Replica Relic Chair** on the **Hermit Island**.

## Description
*Don't Starve Together*: Quit horsing around and make some furniture.

## Crafting Ingredients
- **Boards**: x4
- **Flint**: x4

## Gallery
![Sawhorse Build](Sawhorse Build.png "Common")

## Accessible Carpentry
The Sawhorse is a Prototype station. When standing close to it, players can access the **Carpentry Filter** to prototype wooden furniture and decorations. Players can also use the Sawhorse to craft **Bunch o' Boards** that gives 5 **Boards** for 20 **Logs**.

## Upgrades
The Sawhorse can be upgraded by placing a **Moon Glass Saw Blade**. A Sawhorse with a Moon Glass Saw Blade will allow the crafting and unlocking of stone furniture. Players can also use it to craft **Bunch o' Stone** that will give 5 **Cut Stones** for 15 **Rocks**.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: It makes furniture.
- **Willow**: I love stuff made out of wood! It burns so well!
- **Wolfgang**: Who mightier? Man or machine? Wrong. Wolfgang.
- **Wendy**: Perhaps I could make something nice.

## Tips
- The easiest way to get a Blueprint for the Replica Relic Chair (to build one on the Hermit Island for the Sawhorse Blueprint) is to find and kill the **Resting Horror** in the Ruins.
- The Sawhorse makes a loud noise when a player is nearby, so it is advised not to place it in the main area of your base.

## Trivia

The Encrusted Boat is a Boat that can be crafted from the Nautical Tab in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It requires 6 Boards, 3 Ropes, and 4 Limestone to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. It begins with 800 health, which will deplete over time as it is used or if damaged. It can be repaired with a Boat Repair Kit or by sailing close to a Sea Yard.

The Encrusted Boat gains a ×4 speed boost from riding Waves compared to most other Boats (excluding Walani's Surfboard). In addition to being able to equip boat attachments, it allows the player an extra 2 slots of storage.

While moving, it loses durability at a rate of 1 per 3 seconds, lasting a total of 5 days. It has 0.66s hit immunity, like most boats, and the highest map reveal bonus of 2.5 (tied with the Cargo Boat and Armored Boat).

### Tips
- While under the effects of Purple Grouper or Tropical Bouillabaisse, the player can benefit greatly from the 4x speed boost this boat provides when riding waves because the buff from those foods grants the speed boost regardless of the direction the waves are hit. This synergy is even more pronounced when dealing with overwhelming numbers of waves during the hurricane season and in encounters with bosses and whales.
- Since Coffee adds +5 to base speed, while under its effect an Armored Boat goes from 50% faster to only 22% faster than an Encrusted Boat under the same effect. This gap narrows even more with any additional flat speed bonuses (such as an overcharged WX-78 or from eating Pierrot Fish, Purple Groupers, or Tropical Bouillabaisse). This fact combined with having 60% more HP, 2 inventory slots, and 4x speed boosts from riding waves makes the Encrusted Boat a superior choice for those who have access to these types of speed boosts.
- Using the Hammer on an Encrusted Boat yields 3 Boards, 2 Rope, and 2 Limestone regardless of its durability. It is therefore far cheaper to simply craft a new one rather than use Boat Repair Kits on a damaged Encrusted Boat.

### Trivia
- The Encrusted Boat was added to the Shipwrecked DLC more than a year after its official completion in the Home Sea Home update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.

# Luxury Fan

The **Luxury Fan** is a **Survival** item in the **Reign of Giants** DLC. It requires an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype and costs 5 **Down Feathers**, 2 **Cut Reeds**, and 2 **Ropes** to craft.

## Structure Infobox
- **Icon**: Luxury Fan.png
- **Image**: Luxury Fan Dropped.png
- **Ingredient 1**: Down Feather (5)
- **Ingredient 2**: Cut Reeds (2)
- **Ingredient 3**: Rope (2)
- **Tab**: Survival
- **Tier**: 2
- **Durability**: 15 uses
- **Perk**: Cools the character down and puts out fires
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "featherfan"
- **Description**: Luxuriously soft, luxuriously large.

## Quotes
- Wilson: Down, to bring the temperature down.
- Willow: I dunno... it could put out some fires...
- Wolfgang: Ha! Is as big as head!
- Wendy: That'll make quite a draft.
- WX78: EXCELLENT COOLING SYSTEM
- Wickerbottom: This will induce quite an airflow!
- Woodie: A traditional Canadian fan.
- Maxwell: Is it windy out or is it just my fan?
- Wagstaff: Produces an extraordinary amount of wind.
- Wigfrid: The luxuries öf camp, ön the gö.
- Webber: This thing is huge!
- Walani: An artificial ocean breeze.
- Warly: Why is it so big?

- Wilba: WILBA HATH FANCY FAN
- Wormwood: Fire Outer
- Wheeler: Hey, whatever works.
- Winona: Too fancy.

- Wurt: What bird this come from?!
- Walter: I'm a big fan of staying cool. Get it, because it's a fan?
- Wanda: I've never seen a feather so big! Or have I...

## Description of Use
When used, it puts out nearby **Fires** and reduces **Overheating|body temperature** of the player by 50°, potentially causing the player to start **Freezing** if their temperature is low enough and fully dries all the characters nearby. However, it will never reduce the temperature below 2.5° in the **Shipwrecked** DLC.

Due to the range of its effect, the Luxury Fan is a good substitute for the **Ice Flingomatic** to put out fires during **Summer**. However, if the player starts in **Spring**, this might be unavailable due to the **Moose/Goose** not spawning unless changed in the settings.

## Trivia
- The Luxury Fan used to be called the "Down Thermantidote" and was directly dropped by the Moose/Goose.
  - Thermantidote is a portmanteau of the words "Thermal" and "Antidote".

## Trivia
- Dorsal Fins were added to the Shipwrecked DLC more than a year after its official completion in the Home Sea Home update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.
- While some players can mistake this filler item for a meat food, in actuality it is not, as Bunnymen will not attack the player if it has at least one Dorsal Fin in its inventory.
- This also applies to mobs, as creatures such as Tiger Sharks or Wildbores will not consume Dorsal Fins if they are on the ground.

# Basalts

![Basalt](Basalt1.png)

## Object Info
- **Resources**: None
- **Spawns**: 
- **Renew**: Cannot be destroyed
- **Biome**: 
- **Spawn Code**: "sinkhole", "basalt", "basalt_pillar"

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: That's too strong to break through!
- **Willow**: It's too hard to break!
- **Wolfgang**: Is stronger even than me!
- **Wendy**: Trying to break it would be pointless.
- **WX-78**: INSUFFICIENT DESTRUCTIVE ABILITIES
- **Wickerbottom**: Material of great density!
- **Woodie**: That rock ain't going to move.
- **Maxwell**: I made a rock so heavy that even I cannot lift it.
- **Wagstaff**: Immutable. It mocks my curiosity!
- **Wigfrid**: A thousand mortals couldn't break through this stone.
- **Webber**: Impenetrable.
- **Walani**: The strong, silent type.
- **Warly**: Made of strong stuff!
- **Woodlegs**: Strong it be.
- **Wilba**: 'TIS UNMOVED
- **Wormwood**: Too heavy
- **Wheeler**: It's stronger than my will to break it.

- **Choose**: Wigfrid

Basalts are large rocks which can't be moved or destroyed. They occur frequently in later worlds of **Adventure Mode** or sometimes as part of a **Set Piece** in **Sandbox Mode**, and can come in the form of a pillar.

Basalt was added as a placeholder for **Sinkholes**. Upon the release of the **Underground** update, all Basalt in **Sandbox Mode** were to be replaced by Plugged Sinkholes.

Apart from decoration or forming an indestructible blockade (similar to the **Tree Clump**) it serves no other purpose.

## Prototype Tips
- Players can use the Imprisoned Pig Set Piece in which Basalt spawns to trap any kind of mob, even giants in **Reign of Giants**, and hold them prisoner there without fearing their escape. An easy way to trap them is craft a **Telelocator Focus** inside the "prison" and then use the **Telelocator Staff** on the desired mob. But using the staff near the trap is not advised, because the sanity drain would lower the obelisks, thus allowing the creature to escape.
  - A good use of this would be trapping a **Varg** and farm the **Hounds** it spawns periodically.

## Placeholder Trivia
- **Maxwell**'s quote upon examining Basalt is a direct reference to the **Omnipotence Paradox**.
- **Wanda** doesn't have a unique examination quote for Basalt, instead she uses **Wilson**'s line.

# Electric Isosceles

![Electric Isosceles](File:Electric_Isosceles.png =180x)

- **Sanity Drain:** -15
- **Renew:** Cannot be destroyed
- **Spawn Code:** "bermudatriangle"

## Quotes
- **Wolfgang:** "Is give me uneasy feelings."
- **Wilson:** "Gives me an uneasy feeling."
- **Willow:** "I feel kinda dizzy looking at it."
- **Woodie:** "Kinda spooky, eh?"
- **Maxwell:** "It's calling to me to dive in."
- **Wagstaff:** "A stimulating device. Does it work on electrostatic energy?"
- **Wendy:** "Dark energy courses through these mysterious portals..."
- **Woodlegs:** "Whar they lead is anybody's guess."
- **Wickerbottom:** "I don't believe in mysterious occurrences."
- **Webber:** "How unsettling!"
- **Warly:** "Shouldn't I boat away from these?"
- **WX-78:** "A SCIENTIFIC ANOMALY"
- **Walani:** "Take me to a new surf spot!"
- **Wigfrid:** "Is this a plaything öf Löki?"
- **Wilba:** "WHATFORE ART THAT??"
- **Wormwood:** "Zzzt Zoomer"
- **Wheeler:** "An equalateral adventure."
- **Choose:** Wilson

An **Electric Isosceles** is an object found in the deep **Ocean** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. Electric Isosceles appear as electrified white triangles in the ocean and expand when approached by a player. They act as the **Shipwrecked** version of **Worm Holes**. Sailing through them transports the player and their **Boat** to another Electric Isosceles elsewhere on the map. Like Worm Holes, they can also be given **item**s to transport to the other end. There are 6 Electric Isosceles pairs (in total 12 individual Electric Isosceles) in most worlds and each Electric Isosceles only connects to the other Electric Isosceles of the same pair. Often they can end on two different sides of the ocean.

Traveling through an Electric Isosceles costs 15 **sanity**. **Sanity** can be quickly drained by repeatedly traveling between them.

## Trivia
* Electric Isosceles are a reference to the **Bermuda Triangle**. This is confirmed by their spawn code.

### Overview
The **Composting Bin** is a [Structure](#) exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in **Return of Them**. It is used to produce [Compost](#).

### Categories of Accepted Items
- **Wet:**
  - All [Food](#)s, [Rot](#), [Spoiled Fish](#), [Rotten Egg](#), [Ham Bat](#), [Garland](#), [Seawreath](#), [Fish Food](#)

### Composting Process
After a period of time, the Compost Bin consumes two items and produces Compost. If possible, it consumes one item from each category, otherwise it consumes two from the same category.

### Composting Time
The composting time depends on the current load of the compost bin: The more items, the quicker the composting is done. Composting time also depends on the ratio of wet and dry items. It is fastest when there is 50% of each category and slowest when there are only items of one category.

| Items Loaded | Balanced Time (days) | Unbalanced Time (days) |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 6           | 0.56                | 1.12                  |
| 4 - 5       | 0.68                | 1.36                  |
| 2 - 3       | 0.8                 | 1.6                   |
| Total (for 3 composts without reload) | 2.04 | 4.08 |

### Tips
- For Rot, turning it into Compost and then burning it makes it more efficient.

### Trivia
- The Composting Bin was introduced in the **Reap What You Sow** update.

## Game Mechanics

The Mossy Vine is a naturally spawning object exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in the **Waterlogged** beta. They hang from the canopy of **Great Tree Trunks** and **Above-Average Tree Trunks**. They produce **Figs**. After harvesting, they will regrow a new fig after 20 minutes (2.5 in-game days). They still grow during **Winter**.

Picking a Fig from a Mossy Vine of a Great Tree Trunk will alert nearby **Sea Strider Nests**, causing **Sea Striders** to emerge and swim toward the vine to investigate.

## Trivia

- The code file of Mossy Vine contains two kinds of **Hanging Vines** from the **Hamlet** DLC, their code name is "oceanvine_patch".

# Chess Pieces

Chess Pieces are craftable objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. There are eight different variants that can be crafted at a **Potter's Wheel** and are mostly meant for decoration. Nearly all of them are unlocked by giving their respective **Sketch** to the Potter's Wheel, except for the Bubble Pipe Carving and the Carved Hornucopia, which are always available. Players are able to sculpt Chess Pieces out of two **Rocks** and one **Marble**, **Cut Stone** or **Moon Shard**. The chosen material determining the color of the crafted Chess Piece.

Chess Pieces can be carried by players in the chest slot, similar to **Suspicious Marble**, slowing down their movement speed and preventing them from several inventory actions, such as equipping a handheld item.

## Wood Gates Description

Wood Gates are craftable **Structures** located in the **Structures Tab**. They require an **Alchemy Engine** to be crafted from 2 **Boards** and 1 **Rope**. Wood Gates can be opened and closed by the player, either by clicking on them or by pressing **Space** while standing next to them. Together with **Wood Fences**, they can be used to pen **Mobs**. Wood Gates are flammable and can be destroyed with a **Hammer**, which will return all of their crafting ingredients. Wood Gates placed next to each other will always form a double gate and always open and close together.

## Trivia

- The Wood Gate was introduced to **Don't Starve Together** in the **Cute Fuzzy Animals** update during **A New Reign**. It was later added to **Don't Starve** in the **Quality of Life** update.
- Wood Gates used to consist of two doors until their art was updated to support building double gates.
- Wood Gates will always open in the same direction, no matter on which side the player is standing or how they were rotated when placed.

## Bugs

- Placing Wood Gates to become a double gate can be difficult if they are placed in a gap between two fence ends. It is recommended to remove the fence on one side and place the gates beforehand.
- Visually, Wood Gates do not work well with **Walls** of any kind. In certain angles they can look as if they were floating above them.

## Sugarwood Trees Description
Sugarwood Trees are exclusive plants to the "The Gorge" event in Don't Starve Together. They can only be found alongside Spotty Shrubs in the Sugarwood Memorial Park area, which can only be accessed after buying an Iron Key from Sammy. Tapping them with Tree Tapping Kits allows players to obtain Sap, which is required to cook Syrup. Each tapped Tree grants one Sap, which can be gathered by harvesting the Tapping Kit or removing it completely from the Tree with an Axe. If Sap is not harvested in time, the Tree will become bug-infested and produce Ruined Sap, which cannot be used for cooking. Sugarwood Trees can also be chopped with an Axe to acquire Logs and Twigs, the amount depending on the size of the Tree. Digging up the stump with a Shovel grants an additional Log.

## Trivia
- The "Extra Sappy" Accomplishment is given for gathering Sap from tapped Sugarwood Trees 9 times or more in a single "The Gorge" match.
- The appearance of this tree and the way of harvesting their sap to cook into Syrup is based on Maple trees, which are tapped to harvest and cook maple syrup.
