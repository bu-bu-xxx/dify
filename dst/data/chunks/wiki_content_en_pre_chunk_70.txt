A **Moongleam** is an item exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. They will randomly form and float around inside **Moonstorms** in a similar manner to **Mushroom Spores** and can similarly be caught with a **Bug Net**.

Floating Moongleams will crackle every 5-15 seconds with electricity, dealing 10 damage to players, mobs, and structures with health such as walls in 4 tiles around them. **Astroggles** in the radius, whether equipped, in inventory or on the floor, are recharged by 10% with each crackle.

When there are more than 10 Moongleams on the floor within a radius of 20 tiles, they will be deleted within 30 seconds.

It takes 15 Moongleams in total to complete the **Lunar Siphonator** and summon the **Celestial Champion**. Five Moongleams are needed to build the first stage of the **Lunar Siphonator**, and an additional ten are required to complete the second stage.

Moongleams can be used to force the **Unnatural Portal** in the **Moon Quay Island** to generate items.

## Usage
### Recipe
- **Item 1**: Moongleam (5)
- **Item 2**: Scrap (4)
- **Item 3**: Electrical Doodad (2)
- **Result**: Incomplete Experiment
- **Tool**: Blueprint (rare)

## Tips
- Storing Moongleams in an **Insulated Pack** allows them to last for longer than an in-game year. This is useful if the player wishes to stockpile them for multiple Celestial Champion fights or all-at-once Unnatural Portal farming, without having to deal with catching them again after opening a **Bundling Wrap**.
- The lightning damage of Moongleams can be avoided by wearing lightning proof clothes such as **Rain Coat**.

## Trivia
- The Moongleam was introduced in the **Return of Them#Eye of the Storm|Eye of the Storm** update.
- The Moongleams deal electrical damage, which can charge the **Volt Goat**, but their damage is not affected by wetness.

### Scrapbook Info
Can be used to carve specific shapes on Giant Pumpkins.

The Oversized Pumpkin Carving Tools are a set of three items exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, added in the **Hallowed Nights** 2024 update. They can be obtained from digging **Graves** (15%) or trading **Trinkets** with **Pig King** (15%). They can also be found in a **Set Piece** during Hallowed Nights.

These three items are the **Pumpkin Scooper**, **Pumpkin Knife**, and **Pumpkin Saw**, and each is able to carve 3 different shapes onto a **Giant Pumpkin** and Waxed Giant Pumpkin. Holding one of the items and clicking on the Giant Pumpkin starts the carving. One Giant Pumpkin can have up to 15 carvings. The player can also rotate the shape by using the Mouse Scroll Wheel. The carvings on the pumpkin glow during the evening and night, but the light is not bright enough to avoid **Charlie** attack.

### Description
A **Deer Antler** is an **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It is dropped by the antler-type **No-Eyed Deer** after charging at objects such as **Trees**. Trying to use a Deer Antler to unlock the **Loot Stash** will destroy the antler, drop a **Bone Shard** and cause **Klaus** to spawn. There are three visual variants of the Deer Antler, that all function in the same way. The antler serves no other purpose than being used on the stash.

### Tips
- With a way to ward off Klaus that spawns after the shard is used on the Stash (e.g., **Telelocator Staff**, Using **Mobs** as bait, etc.), the player can insert all of their easy-to-find antlers to turn into **Bone Shards**, as another Klaus will not spawn if the Antler has already been used on the sack.

### Trivia
- Deer Antlers were introduced in the **Winter's Feast update**, alongside the **Winter's Feast** event of the same name.

# Bug (Food Category)

## Exclusivity: Hamlet
## Incomplete
> "Am I really this desperate for food?" - Maxwell

**Bug** is a **Food** category added in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. There are currently only 2 items in this category: **Bean Bugs** and **Gummy Slugs**.

Both of these items can only be obtained by flipping **Stone Slab**s. After 8 in-game days, the **Stone Slab**s will regenerate their loot, making these items renewable.

Each of these items has one **Crock Pot** recipe associated with it, however, they both require numerical amounts of one of the specific items, not a decimal amount of bugs. Due to this, the category is never used for determining the produced crockpot dish.

| Raw | Cooked | Bug Value | Crock Pot |
|-----|--------|-----------|-----------|
| ![Bean Bugs] | Bean Bugs | ![Cooked Bean Bugs] | Cooked Bean Bugs | 1 | Yes |
| ![Gummy Slug] | Gummy Slug | ![Cooked Gummy Slug] | Cooked Gummy Slug | 1 | Yes |

## Crock Pot Meals That Use Bugs

| Food | Name | Health | Hunger | Sanity | Perish time (days) | Cook time (sec) | Priority | Recipe | Filler/Restrictions |
|------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|----------------|----------|--------|--------------------|

At 54 seconds of the trailer, you can see the inscription "I have more to tell you", which made it clear that there is not a big puzzle in the trailer. [Comatose](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/3173-dec-11-update-naughty-nice-preview-video/?do=findComment&comment=26265) was the first to find it.

# Beards in Don't Starve Together

Beards are a type of [Curio](Curio_Cabinet) in *Don't Starve Together* that allows the player to apply cosmetic skins to beards on certain characters. Currently, the only characters this Curio applies to are [Wilson](Wilson) and [Webber](Webber).

Beards will automatically be equipped for the corresponding head skin. Otherwise, the beard will be the default beard. If the player wishes to do so, Wilson or Webber can use the [Clean Sweeper](Clean_Sweeper) on himself to get a new beard. When previewing the beard, the character will display the last worn skins.

## Wilson Skins

## Trivia

- The description of Piggsbury Beard refers to the tale of the three little pigs, namely the moment where one of the piglets says: "No, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin, I'll not let you in."

# Message in a Bottle (Don't Starve Together)

## Item Info
- **Image**: ![Message in a Bottle](Message in a Bottle (DST).png)
- **Stack**: Does not stack.
- **Perk**: Reveal [[Crabby Hermit]] and [[Sunken Chest]] on the [[Map]].
- **Spawn Code**: "messagebottle"
- **Dropped By**: {{pic24|Marotter}}(5%), {{pic24|Crab King}}x2-4

## Quotes from Characters
- Wilson: I wonder if it's for me!
- Willow: Hey! It's a bottle of emergency kindling!
- Wolfgang: Has tiny note inside!
- Wendy: I wonder what poor forgotten soul sent that.
- WX-78: HOW ARCHAIC
- Wickerbottom: Not the most effective postal service.
- Woodie: Sure beats a paper airplane.
- Maxwell: Someone sensibly bottled up their feelings and tossed them out to sea.
- Wigfrid: What's this? Battle plans?
- Webber: There's something inside!
- Winona: Wonder where this came from?
- Warly: I do hope that's a recipe inside!
- Wortox: I'm tempted to take a peek!
- Wormwood: Holding thing
- Wurt: Wicker-lady!! Read what it say!
- Wanda: Oh! There's a note inside!
- Choose: Woodie

## Scrapbook Info
Some messages are notes, some are maps to special locations.

## Description
A **Message in a Bottle** is found in **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. They are found naturally in the **Coastal Ocean**, and can also spawn every 1 to 2 days 10 **Tiles** from the players in the **Ocean**. The spawning bottle will need 1.25 tiles of clear space in the Ocean, and must be at least 8.75 tiles from any flotsam. The spawning attempt will happen even if the player is on land, but the attempt will fail and retry every 60 seconds.

## Sunken Chest Marker
![Sunken Chest Marker](Sunken Chest Marker.png)

All messages read by a player reveals the [[Crabby Hermit]]'s location or will have text message, unless the player already met the Crabby Hermit.

After meeting Crabby Hermit, reading a message has a 60% chance to generate and reveal a new [[Sunken Chest]] and a 40% chance to reveal nothing. If 10 markers are active at a time, the position of an already existing Sunken Chest is revealed instead.

If the player has defeated [[Crab King]] and returned the [[Cracked Pearl]], each bottle is guaranteed to reveal a new Sunken Chest if there's fewer than 10 markers on the map.

After reading, the Message in a Bottle turns into an [[Empty Bottle#Don't Starve Together|Empty Bottle]].

## Quotes from Message in a Bottle
If a Message in a Bottle does not reveal a position, it will contain a message instead:
- I know you're still out there, my dear. I won't ever give up.
- I'm waiting for you. At the spot where we first met. I've been waiting so long...
- Please come home. I miss you so much.
- I still have the last gift you gave me. "A pearl for Pearl"... remember?
- I'll keep sending messages, until one reaches you...
- Have you found your treasure yet? When you do, will you come home?

## Trivia
- If the player tries to spawn the Message in a Bottle using the [[Console]] and reads it, the character will say "This message is faded, I can't read it".
- Messages in a Bottle were introduced to Don't Starve Together in the [[Return of Them#She Sells Sea Shells|She Sells Sea Shells]] update.
- In DST, if the player writes in the command line "c_give("messagebottle_throwable",1)" then the game will give out a bottle with a message that can be equipped and thrown at objects or on the ground. If you throw this bottle with a message at an object in the sea, it will sink.
- The fact that the glass color of the bottle has a slightly turquoise tint may indicate that it is made from moon glass ([[Moon Shard]]). This may explain how Pearl makes these bottles.

Cooked Frog Legs are made by Cooking Frog Legs on a Campfire, Fire Pit, or Star. They restore 1 Health and do not drain Sanity unlike their raw counterpart. It can also be used to make the Froggle Bunwich, which is cooked in the Crock Pot.

These are commonly used as a food source in the Adventure Mode level, A Cold Reception, due to the abundance of Frogs that spawn from the frequent Frog Rain.

### Usage
- **Cooking**: 
  - ![Frog Legs](Frog Legs) → ![Cooked Frog Legs](Cooked Frog Legs) (fire=yes)
- **Drying**: 
  - ![Frog Legs](Frog Legs) → ![Small Jerky](Small Jerky) (dry = yes)

  - ![Frog Leg](Frog Leg) + ![Vegetables](Vegetables) + ![Filler](Filler) + ![Filler](Filler) → ![Froggle Bunwich](Froggle Bunwich) (pot=yes)

### Prototype Tips
* Frog Legs could be a good meat resource for Wigfrid early game, due to her ability to knock out Frogs in 2 hits with her Battle Spear, and she can recover even if she gets hit, since she starts with a Battle Helm and gains health as she kills opponents.

### Trivia
* Despite being a meat item, Frog Legs cannot be traded to the Pig King for Gold Nuggets. 
* Eggs gotten from a Birdcage can be traded, making it possible to indirectly obtain Gold Nuggets with Frog Legs.
* In Don't Starve Together, if Wilson is equipped with his full Survivor Skin, his portrait will show him eating Cooked Frog Legs.
* Multiple characters state that this item is still twitchy or still jumps. In real life, frog legs are known to do just that, especially when salt is added.
* Humorously, the gigantic boss Toadstool drops a pair of Frog Legs the same size as those of a Frog or Merm, despite it being much bigger than either of them.

It can be quaffed like **Anti Venom**, but this doesn't remove **Poison** or consume the Snake Oil. It can be removed by throwing it in a **Fire Pit** or **Chiminea**, but it has no value as **Fuel** either.

## Hamlet
Snake Oil is also included in the **Hamlet** DLC. It can be obtained rarely by killing **Vipers**.

## Trivia
- "Snake oil" is an expression that refers to health products with no verifiable benefits.
- There are 2 game files that prove that the intended use for Snake Oil is for it to have no use:
  - **poisonhealer.lua**: Part of the 3rd line reads: `--Used for snakeoil. We don't want it to actually do anything.` "We" is referred to the developers.
  - **snakeoil.lua**: Lines 23 to 27 read, which mean it is a fuel with a value of 0 and is a poison cure that does not cure at all:
    ```
    inst:AddComponent("fuel")
    inst.components.fuel.fuelvalue = 0

    inst:AddComponent("poisonhealer")
    inst.components.poisonhealer.enabled = false
    ```
