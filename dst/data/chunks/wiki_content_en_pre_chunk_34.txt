- The **Woven - Elegant Lavaproof Bugnet** skin was introduced in the **An Eye for An Eye** update in 2021, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's **Terraria**. Its rarity was **Inspired - Elegant** initially, but received a change in August 19, 2022.

## Trivia
- In the old science system, the Bug Net crafting cost was 30 Research Points.

## Bugs
- During daytime, hovering the mouse pointer over Fireflies with the Bug Net equipped will not give the 'Catch' prompt, but pressing the spacebar while standing next to them will catch the Fireflies.

Spiders reappear in **The Forge** event in *Don't Starve Together* as allies specific to **Webber**. Webber's spiders only appear in groups of three and are greatly reduced in size. These "baby" spiders are immune to all forms of damage and do not draw aggro from enemies. They fall asleep if Webber is killed. Like **Abigail**, Spiders do not attack Petrified or **Sleeping** enemies unless Webber attacks them first. Additionally, each Spider appears to do the same amount of damage as in the base game.

- **Choose**: WX-78

**Scrapbook Info**: Attracts Reanimated Skeletons to the holder.

The **Shadow Thurible** is a **Don't Starve Together** exclusive **Item**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It is dropped by the **Ancient Fuelweaver**, along with the **Bone Armor** and **Bone Helm**.

When equipped, the Shadow Thurible will attract the **Reanimated Skeleton** to the holder. It has a durability of 9 minutes and can be refueled with **Nightmare Fuel** for +33% durability, allowing it to last 3 more minutes for each Nightmare Fuel added. It will not disappear when its durability reaches 0%. Instead, it stays in the hand equipment slot but has no effect until it is refueled.

When fueled, the Thurible, whether equipped by a player or on the ground, prevents all players within 6 units (1.5 tiles) from being snared by the **Reanimated Skeleton|Caves Skeleton** or Ancient Fuelweaver's bone cage attack.

It can be deconstructed using a **Deconstruction Staff** for 2 **Cut Stone**, 6 **Nightmare Fuel** and 1 **Ashes**.

## Tips
- The Shadow Thurible can be used to lure Surface and Cave variants of the Reanimated Skeleton, and prevents the Cave variant's bone snare in its radius. It does not lure the Ancient Fuelweaver, but will still prevent his bone snare.
- If the Caves Reanimated Skeleton is attracted by the Shadow Thurible, it will still be hostile to other entities, including other player characters.
- On the surface, the Forest Skeleton can be brought right next to the players so they don't have to be followed to pick their resources.
- In the caves, the Caves Skeleton can be brought with the player to attack enemies, as it deals a large amount of damage.
- The player can control the Reanimated Skeleton in order to farm Logs by placing them in a straight line and positioning oneself to break down all the trees.

## Trivia
- The Shadow Thurible was introduced in the **Hearts of the Ruins** update.
- A **thurible** is a metal incense burner used during worship services.
- Most character quotes regarding its smell suggest it smells like at least one of fire or sulphur, and most often both. However

- Using the Fryfocals while wet will shock Wagstaff twice, dealing a total of 16 damage (affected by armor); all lightning insulating clothes such as Rain Coat and Snakeskin Jacket cannot prevent the shock damage.

- **Wurt**: Cutty thing?
- **Walter**: I found a whisker on my chin, I'm sure my beard will come in any day now.
- **Choose**: Webber
- **Wanda**: This seems dangerous.

The Razor is a craftable Tool Item found in the Tools Tab. It requires 2 Twigs and 2 Flints to craft, and a Science Machine to prototype. Unlike other Tools, on PC it cannot be equipped, and to be used it has to be lifted and used on a target instead. Players using a Controller have to simply be near an entity that can be shaved for the "Shave" prompt to appear. Since it has no durability, the Razor has infinite uses.

The Razor can be used to shave Wilson's Beard, which provides leftover Beard Hair. To shave the Beard, simply right-click the Razor while it's in the inventory, or hover over the target. The amount of Beard Hair received depends on the beard's length. The Razor can also be used to shave Beefalos while they are sleeping (whether at night or when put to sleep using Sleep Darts, a Life Giving Amulet, or a Pan Flute), resulting in 3 Beefalo Wool. This requires taking it out of the inventory and hovering over the beefalo. The Beefalo will not wake up after being shaved, but Beefalo in heat will sometimes wake up and attack. In Don't Starve Together, you can use a razor to shave sea weeds for up to 3 barnacles. This depends on how many barnacles the sea weed has, and will aggravate any nearby sea weeds.

Webber can also use the Razor to shave his Beard. The amount of Silk received depends on the Beard's length.

## Skins
In Don't Starve Together, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the Belongings page.

* The Woven - Distinguished Scissors skin is available in the Klei Rewards shop for 1,200 Klei points.

![Woven - Distinguished Scissors](Scissors Icon.png) 'They're a shear delight.' See ingame [Scissors](:File:Scissors.png)
![Woven - Distinguished Straight Razor](Straight Razor Icon.png) 'Get ready for another close shave.' See ingame [Straight Razor](:File:Straight Razor.png)
![Woven - Distinguished Barber's Razor](Barber's Razor Icon.png) 'Cutting-edge barbering technology!' See ingame [Barber's Razor](:File:Barber's Razor Icon.png)

## Tips
* Using the Razor to acquire Beefalo Wool is more efficient than killing Beefalo outright since the Wool will eventually regrow allowing players to shave the same Beefalo again

# Royal Crown

The **Royal Crown** is a [Hat] item exclusive to the [Don't Starve: Hamlet] DLC. It is dropped when the [Queen Womant] is killed and can be given to the [Pig Queen] in exchange for a [Royal Gallery Key].

## Quotes
- Wilson: Don't mess up my hair, crown.
- Willow: I think it suits me.

## Tips
- Unlike most other items that passively restore sanity, the Royal Crown is unique in that it does so without being able to get worn out.
- Since the Royal Crown is non-renewable and has an effect, it may be worth to give [Lost Relics|Blue Sow], [Lost Relics|Jeweled Truffle] and [Regal Scepter] to the [Pig Queen] in order to obtain all gallery items. Or killing the queen afterwards.
  - Once Wilba is unlocked, the Royal Crown becomes more worth keeping.

## Usage
The Royal Crown can be used to unlock [Wilba], the player must give the crown to Queen Malfalfa. Wilba will disappear from her room and become unlocked. When worn, the Royal Crown restores 4.4 Sanity per minute for the player.

## Recipe

# Spiderhat

![Spiderhat Dropped](Spiderhat%20Dropped.png) ![Spiderhat](Spiderhat.png)

The Spiderhat is a **Hat** [Item] that is dropped by **Spider Queens**, allowing the player to control **Spiders**. This effect also applies to all Spiders in **Caves**, but they will not follow the player in or out of the caves. However, Spider Queens will see through this disguise and will attack the player regardless. The hat only lasts for 2 minutes (6 game hours), degrading while equipped.

## Properties

- **Water Resistance:** 20% resistance
- **Wears Out:** 2 min
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Equip Slot:** Head
- **Dropped By:** ![Spider Queen](Spider%20Queen.png)
- **Perk:** Control Spiders
- **Spawn Code:** "spiderhat"
- **Sanity Drain:** -2.00/min

## Quotes

- **Wilson:** "I hope I got all of the spider goo out of it."
- **Willow:** "Who's your mommy!"
- **Wolfgang:** "Is like smooch from giant bug."
- **Wendy:** "Time to stare into the abyss."
- **WX-78:** "IT WIRELESSLY TRANSMITS THOUGHTS TO SPIDERS"
- **Wickerbottom:** "With this I should be able to exert psionic control over the spiders."
- **Woodie:** "She's a real beaut, ain't she?"
- **Maxwell:** "Spiders have such malleable wills."
- **Wagstaff:** "A brain wave converter! Incredible!"
- **Wigfrid:** "A perfect way to infiltrate the enemy camp."
- **Webber:** "Very upsetting."
- **Walani:** "Ha! I'm your boss now, spiders!"
- **Warly:** "Well, it is on my head now. Best make the most of it."
- **Woodlegs:** "Wear a spider on me head? Bah!"
- **Wilba:** "FOR SPIDERS TO LEND WILBA THEIR EARS"
- **Wormwood:** "Leggy Bug head thing"
- **Wheeler:** "It'll be all the rage in the murky places."
- **Winona:** "This is disgusting."
- **Wortox:** "Hyuyu, this is grotesque!"
- **Wurt:** "Ha ha, look like Webby boy."
- **Walter:** "Woby keeps growling at me when I wear it..."
- **Wanda:** "A lovely reminder of that time I was almost eaten by a giant spider."

## Tips

The Spiderhat is a great tool for quickly farming large amounts of **Silk** and **Spider Glands**. For this to work all that is needed are 3-4 Spider Dens and a Spiderhat. At Dusk when Spiders come out to roam - briefly equip the Spiderhat to recruit some Spiders and order them to attack one of the unaffected Spiders that is near a Den, then move out of their aggro range and unequip the hat to conserve its durability. This will result in a Spider "civil war", where non befriended Spiders will attack the previously befriended ones and result in a snowball effect.

The downside is that all Monster Meat will be eaten quickly, so only Silk and Glands will be acquired using this method. Spiders respawn quickly and if there are several Tier 3 Dens around, this can be repeated at Dusk every day.

This method is also very efficient for clearing out large amounts of Spiders and destroying Dens (clearing Spider-infested Rockyland for example).

## Trivia

- The Spiderhat was added in the **Long Live the Queen** update.
- Before **Spoiled Rotten**, the Spiderhat was craftable. It required a **Straw Hat**, a **Spider Egg**, and 4 **Monster Meat**. Its crafting description was "Spiders will call you 'mom'."

# Splumonkeys

**Splumonkeys** are neutral Mobs found in the Ruins. They live in Splumonkey Pods. They will follow players, stealing items on the ground and looting containers. When killed, they drop any stolen items, 1 Morsel, 1 Cave Banana, and possibly 1 Nightmare Fuel.

## Behavior

Splumonkeys pick Bananas from Cave Banana Trees, Berries from Berry Bushes, and any Mushrooms in sight. They will harvest crops from Farm plots, steal items from Chests, Ice Boxes, Backpacks, Chester, Hutch, and Woby, plus take Food from Crock Pots. If they pick up a Hat, they will wear it. The hat will give the same benefits to the Splumonkey as a player (a Miner Hat will provide light, a Football Helmet defense, etc.), and will lose durability at the same rate a player would.

Like many other neutral mobs, if one Splumonkey is attacked, all nearby Splumonkeys will become aggressive toward the attacker. Splumonkeys defend themselves by throwing Manure at a distance or biting enemies that come within melee range. Being hit by Manure causes damage (0 health will be lost however) and lowers Sanity by 10 points. Splumonkeys can hold a maximum of three Manure, and eating Food items will replenish this count. They prefer to run from any attacker and throw any Manure they have from a distance, so the player may need to corner a Splumonkey in order to get close enough to hurt it with melee weapons.

If any non-player creature attacks a Splumonkey while the player is fighting them, all other nearby Splumonkeys will attack the non-player creature instead of the player. When fighting non-player creatures, Splumonkeys will use melee instead of their manure attacks and will not run at a distance to avoid damage. For example, if Wendy attacks a Splumonkey with Abigail nearby, and Abigail attacks one, all other Splumonkeys will attack Abigail.

At the onset of an Earthquake, all Splumonkeys return to their Splumonkey Pods. Once there, they will drop all the items they have (excluding worn headgear). Similarly, when a player kills one Splumonkey, all other Splumonkeys will immediately drop their carried items (again, excluding worn headgear) and run back to the Splumonkey Pods. Splumonkeys will not do this if their comrade is killed by a follower or other mob. Shadow Splumonkeys are not affected by any of these events.

On occasion, Splumonkeys will follow the player, especially if the player has a Cave Banana in their inventory. Unlike other followers, Splumonkeys do not assist but only harass.

Similar to Prime Apes, Splumonkeys can be distracted with Silly Monkey Ball.

If Splumonkeys are on the surface and homeless or too far away from their pod, they will sleep at daytime and wake up at dusk or upon being attacked.

Splumonkeys spawned with console up the surface will aid Powder Monkeys in war.

Aggravated Shadow Splumonkeys will chase the player until death, until they transform back into normal ones, or until the player gets far enough away from them. Because they move faster than the player, this will require some kind of movement speed boost.

Below is the number of hits it takes with each weapon to kill a Splumonkey. Splumonkeys take 2 blasts from the Ice Staff to be frozen and 1 Sleep Dart to be put to sleep.

| Weapon | No. of hits for | No. of hits for Shadow Splumonkey |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Fishing Rod/Bug Net | 30 | 10 |
| Lucy the Axe | 8 | 5 |
| Shovel/Pitchfork | 5 | 4 |
| Hammer/Torch/Umbrella | 3-5 | 2 or 3 |
| Walking Cane/Willow's Lighter | 3 | 2 |
| Axe/Pickaxe | 2 | 1 |

## Tips

* If a Splumonkey and a player remain idle with an item between them, the Splumonkey will forget the player and attempt to pick up the item. The window of them stealing the item can be used to kill the Splumonkey. If the player is right next to a Splumonkey while they are stealing an item, the player can get two-three free hits before they run off if not attacked by any other Splumonkeys. Attacked Splumonkeys near players will forget about stealing the item and run from all players.
* Splumonkeys do not recognize Wilbur as their king and will not be friendly to him; Splumonkeys are different from Prime Apes.
* Despite having low stats, their numbers, projectile attacks

## Scrapbook Info
This needs some fertilizing after planting. For Item

## Description
Stone Fruit Bushes are **Plants** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** that can be found on the **Lunar Island**. They can be harvested to obtain 3 **Stone Fruit**.

Stone Fruit Bushes can be dug up with a **Shovel** to be replanted in a new location, but doing so will require that the bush be **Fertilized** before producing more Stone Fruit. A fertilized bush will support 3 harvests. Another method of attainment is by planting **Sprouting Stone Fruit**, the Stone Fruit Bushes plant by this way don't need to be fertilized. Stone Fruit Bushes also grow during **Winter**.

Stone Fruit Bush has 4 stages and it cycle around them. It can be harvested only in the Pick stage.

## Stages
| Stage | Time |
|-------|------|
| ![Empty](Stone_Fruit_Bush_Empty_48px.png) | Empty | 2 days ± 1 minute |
| ![Prepick](Stone_Fruit_Bush_Prepick_48px.png) | Prepick | 3 minutes ± 1 minute |
| ![Pick](Stone_Fruit_Bush_Planted_48px.png) | Pick | 3 days ± 1 minute |
| ![Crumble](Stone_Fruit_Bush_Crumble_48px.png) | Crumble | 1 day ± 1 minute |

A Stone Fruit Bush in crumble stage looks similar to the Pick stage, but there are cracks on the Stone Fruits on the bush. Harvesting at this stage obtains nothing but reverts it to the empty stage.

## Trivia
- Stone Fruit Bushes were introduced in the **Turn of Tides** update.

# Captain Hat

## Shipwrecked

### Item Infobox
- **Exclusivity**: Shipwrecked, Hamlet
- **Name**: Captain Hat
- **Ingredients**:
  - Seaweed: x1
  - Bone Shards: x1
  - Straw Hat: x1
- **Durability**: 2 Days
- **Tab**: Nautical
- **Tier**: 1
- **Perk**: Boat loses durability slower (except when hitting waves or attacked).
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: captainhat
- **Description**: Wear one. Your boat will respect you more.
- **Dropped By**: Blue Whale Carcass, White Whale Carcass, Steamer Trunk, X Marks The Spot
- **Sold By**: The Sow's Ear Hat Shop (20 Oincs) in Hamlet

The Captain Hat is a craftable Hat Item in the Shipwrecked DLC. It is found in the Nautical Tab, requires a Science Machine to prototype, and a Straw Hat, Bone Shards, and Seaweed to craft. It lasts 2 days, and a Sewing Kit will restore it to full Durability.

When worn, it causes Boats to lose their durability at half rate while sailing. It has no effect on the durability lost when the Boat hits Waves or is attacked. It also has no effect when the player character is not driving a boat. In addition to being crafted, it can also be found in Steamer Trunks, Blue Whales, and X Marks the Spot treasure chests.

Due to being a relatively cheap item to craft, it may be practical to use it instead of entirely relying on Boat Repair Kits or crafting new Boats, especially in long expeditions where the player is away from or lacks the time to gather necessary supplies.

## Hamlet

The Captain Hat is also included in the Hamlet DLC, however, it cannot be crafted as some of its materials are unavailable. Instead, it can be bought for 20 Oincs at the The Sow's Ear Hat Shop in the Pig City.

# Thulecite Crown

The Thulecite Crown is a craftable **Item** found in the **Ancient Tab**. It requires 4 **Nightmare Fuel**, 4 **Thulecite**, and an **Ancient Pseudoscience Station** to craft. It also has a 33% chance to be found inside a **Large Ornate Chest**. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Thulecite Crowns cannot be prototyped and can only be crafted when near an **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**.

## Properties

- **Head Armor** that will absorb 90% of physical damage and has 1200 durability.
- When the wearer takes damage from an attack, it has a 33% chance to create a force field.
- The force field lasts for 4 seconds, preventing all damage from attacks (except for **Fire**) and granting stun immunity.
- While the force field is active, 5% of incoming damage is reduced from **Sanity**.
- The force field cannot occur more than once every 9 seconds.
- Unequipping the Crown will disable an active force field, even though the animation remains.
- The Crown's force field emits enough light to protect the player from **Charlie**.

## Downloadable Content

- In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, players have a small chance of finding **Green Gems** inside **Tumbleweeds**, thus making Thulecite Crown renewable, since more Thulecite can be gained with the use of **Construction Amulets** and **Deconstruction Staffs**.
- In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, Thulecite Crowns can be obtained as a possible reward from the **Slot Machine** and **X Marks the Spot** treasure **Chest**s. It also can always be found in a **Chest of the Depths** left behind by the **Quacken** after its death, making Thulecite Crowns renewable also in **Shipwrecked**.

## Tips

- The Thulecite Crown is more suited for **tanking** enemies instead of **kiting** them.
- The Crown is really useful when facing big groups of Mobs like **Spiders**, **Hounds**, and **Birchnutters**, as the force field will protect the players from being stunlocked.
- The force field will protect from the special effects of enemy attacks, such as those of **Frogs**.
- The Crown is a great armor for **Willow**, **Maxwell**, and **Wigfrid** (only in **Reign of Giants**) since these characters can regain their sanity easily.
- On the other hand, the Crown is not efficient when used on **Woodlegs**, since his maximum sanity value is lower than other characters and drops constantly when on land.
- It is generally advised to also wear disposable body armor to increase the life of the Thulecite Crown. In **Don't Starve Together**, the **Log Suit** can absorb roughly 47% of already absorbed damage, effectively increasing the life of the Thulecite Crown from 840 to 1585.

## Trivia

- The Thulecite Crown was added in **A Moderately Friendly Update**.
- Although the crown showcases a **Red Gem**, one does not need it to craft the crown.

# Scrapbook

The **Scrapbook** is a feature added to **Don't Starve Together** in the **From Beyond | Terrors Below** update. It is a collection of Items and Creatures that have previously been discovered by the Player, containing details such as creature Health and Attack damage, Food and the stats they give, and examination quotes from each of the playable characters. You can use **Scrapbook Pages** to discover things you don't know. In this case, the object will be displayed in black and white, and its characteristics will not be displayed until you examine the object directly.

Restores lost "maximum health".

## Trivia

- Before the March 8th, 2016 update, the crafting recipe for the Booster Shot required 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves, and one Stinger.
- The booster shot is used for medicine to upgrade the body's immune system to fight a virus that may come later in life if not given the booster shot. However, in Don't Starve Together, the booster shot is used after the character has been affected by maximum health penalties.
- Having Rot as an ingredient refers to Penicillin, an anti-biotic derived from mold.

## Bugs

- The Booster Shot can be used on mobs. The item will be consumed and results in no effects whatsoever.

# Scalemail

## Overview
**Scalemail** is an **Armor Item** from the **Reign of Giants** DLC, crafted in the **Fight Tab**. It requires 1 **Scales**, 1 **Log Suit**, and 3 **Pig Skin** to craft, and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.

- **Durability**: 1350 HP
- **Perk**: Grants immunity to fire damage. Ignites attackers. Restores sanity over time.
- **Sanity Drain**: +3.3/min
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "armordragonfly"
- **Tab**: Fight
- **Tier**: 2
- **Description**: Armor with a fiery temper.
- **Protection**: 70%

## Craftable Ingredients
- **Ingredient 1**: Scales (Multiplier: 1)
- **Ingredient 2**: Log Suit (Multiplier: 1)
- **Ingredient 3**: Pig Skin (Multiplier: 3)

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: Hot mail!
- **Willow**: Yay! More FIRE!!!
- **Wolfgang**: Wolfgang not need protection.
- **Wendy**: I'd like to wear it inside-out.
- **WX-78**: SCALES FUNCTION SIMILAR TO MINIATURE FLAMETHROWERS
- **Wickerbottom**: Pyrotechnic armor!
- **Woodie**: Plaid is all the armor I need.
- **Maxwell**: That's some fly mail.
- **Wagstaff**: Is it made of asbestos?
- **Wigfrid**: Excellent armör för the heat öf battle.
- **Webber**: Another creature casing.
- **Walani**: This armor is so hot right now.
- **Warly**: Heavy and hot.
- **Woodlegs**: She be hot ta th'touch o'me enemies!
- **Wilba**: 'TIS A FWOOSHING ARMOR
- **Wormwood**: Fire keeper outer
- **Wheeler**: Some kind of fancy flight suit.
- **Winona**: Bit flashy, hey?
- **Wortox**: Ooo, I've always wanted to be scaly.
- **Wurt**: More scales!!
- **Wanda**: I think it looks better on me than it did on the bug.

## Exclusive DLCs
- **Reign of Giants**
- **Hamlet**
- **Don't Starve Together**

## Tips
1. Wearing the Scalemail to regain Sanity will not decrease its durability unlike Dress items, allowing infinite Sanity regeneration as long as the wearer stays out of a combat-heavy situation.
2. Its fire immunity makes it ideal for fighting the Dragonfly, making the second encounter with the giant much easier than the first.
3. Care should be taken when fighting regular Mobs. When they are set on fire by the armor, they can spread fire to nearby Structures and plants, possibly harming the player's resources.
4. As this is difficult to obtain and cannot be repaired, one should always wear a Football Helmet or better head armor with it in combat, so as to avoid it losing too much durability. In DS, the head armor should be equipped last to make it lose more durability from damage than the armor.
5. Using the Deconstruction Staff on a damaged Scalemail will return 1 Scale, 1 Log Suit with 100% durability and a number of Pig Skin relative to the damage on the Scalemail (armor at: 100% ~ 68% = 3 pig skins; 67% ~ 35% = 2 pig skins; 34% ~ 1% = 1 pig skin). In conclusion, it's possible to renew the Scalemail at the cost of 20% of the Deconstruction Staff and some Pig Skins.

## Trivia
- With the introduction of the Scalemail, Willow is no longer the only character that can be immune to fire damage. She is the only one naturally immune to fire damage without special effects in place.
- The Scalemail used to have the same stats as the Thulecite Suit and wasn't able to set Mobs on fire.
- Like the Log Suit, this armor also makes a slight noise while the player is moving.

## Trivia

- California Roll was added to Don't Starve Together in the Hook, Line, and Inker update.
- The California Roll was invented to popularize sushi in North America. To become appetizing for people who did not like seeing seaweed, it's prepared "inside out", where the seaweed is inside and the rice is outside of the roll. However, the in-game image for California Roll has the seaweed outside, indicating it's not actually a California Roll.

# Mosling

The Mosling is a small baby bird in the Reign of Giants DLC, spawned from an Egg on a nest made by a Moose/Goose during Spring. Nearby Moslings will form a herd centered around a single nest. They will roam around eating various Food they can find, including foods from Crock Pots and drying racks. When Spring ends, the Moslings will take flight and ascend into the sky. If killed, a Mosling will increase the player's Naughtiness level by 6.

## Structure Infobox

- Naughtiness: 6
- Diet: Meat, Veggie, Seeds
- Health: 350
- Damage: 50
- Attack Period: 3
- Attack Range: 2
- Walk Speed: 5
- Spawn Code: mossling
- Special Ability: When angry, forms whirlwind to attack player.
- Drops: x1 Meat, x1 Drumstick, 2-3 Down Feathers (133%)
- Spawn From: Moose/Goose Egg

## Quotes

- Wilson: Aaah! You are definitely not an electron!
- Willow: Its feathers are frazzled.
- Wolfgang: Mmmm. Is still breakfast, I think.
- Wendy: A new life. The last thing anyone needs.
- WX-78: OFFSPRING OF UNCERTAIN MAKEUP

- Maxwell: That's a fluffy... thing.
- Wagstaff: An animal capable of wind manipulation! Extraordinary!
- Wigfrid: Yöu are nöt large enöugh tö be my steed.
- Webber: Hungry little guys.

- Wilba: TIS TEENY BIG BIRD
- Wormwood: Why so hungry?
- Wheeler: You could be a great flyer if you just applied yourself.
- Winona: Don'tcha just wanna noogie it?
- Wortox: The whirlwind of youth.
- Wurt: Hee-hee, funny waddler.
- Walter: Aw, they're kind of cute!
- Wanda: They're cute NOW...

## Strategy

Recruit some Rock Lobsters. The lobsters won't attack the Moslings until the player does (or until the player takes damage), so it will be necessary to hit them at least once. It's advisable to focus on one at a time (hit once, then dodge until the lobsters kill that one). Two lobsters should be enough, but a bigger group will finish off the Moslings faster. Lobsters move quite slowly, so try to lure the Moslings into narrow areas or to the edge of the map.

## Tips

- An extremely easy way to take out a brood of Moslings that hasn't hatched yet is to use the Old Bell. Strike the egg three times with the hammer, and then ring the bell. When the player hears Bigfoot stomping toward them, strike the egg for the final time. The egg will hatch, and as the Moslings begin their spawning animation, Bigfoot will come down, killing all of them.
- Moslings and Splumonkeys are the only two mobs in Reign of Giants DLC which can harvest crops from farms and food items from Crock Pots.

## Trivia

- Mosling is a portmanteau of the words "moose" and "gosling", the latter of which is a baby goose. This most likely means that the Mosling is an adolescent version of the Moose/Goose.
- Moslings cannot damage Walls.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC, Bone Shards can also be obtained by hammering **Bones**, destroying **Tumbleweed**s, attacking **Hound Mound**s, or as vomited gifts from friendly **Catcoon**s. They are used in several additional crafting recipes, including the **Bucket-o-poop**, the **Rain Hat**, the **Rain Coat** and the **Eyebrella**.

## Periodic Attacks

Before an attack, the player will begin to hear rumbling growls which grow more frequent the closer the attack draws. The older a world is, the more frequently attacks will come and the more worms will spawn with each wave.

| Next attack (days) | Count | Advance warning (seconds) |
|-------------------|-------|------------------------|
| Day 0 to 9        | 10-17 | 120                    |
| Day 10 to 24      | 10-17 | 60                     |
| Day 25 to 49      | 8-15  | 45                     |
| Day 50 to 99      | 8-15  | 30                     |
| Day 100 or more   | 6-11  | 30                     |

The highest custom setting for Depth Worms is less dangerous than after day 100 on the Default setting.

| World_Customization/Don't_Starve | Delay (days) | Count | Advance warning (seconds) |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------|------------------------|
| Never                        | --          | --    | --                     |
| Less                         | 10-17       | 1-2   | 60                     |
| More                         | 8-15        | 1-2   | 45                     |
| Lots                         | 6-11        | 2-3   | 30                     |

## Behavior

When it is not engaged with the player, it will seek out areas with harvestable objects then set its lure and lay in wait, or emerge to consume both meats and vegetables. This lure will appear as a Mysterious Plant. If the player attempts to harvest the displayed lure, or remains nearby for too long, the worm will emerge and attack. During this time the main body of the worm resides underground.

# One-man Band

The **One-man Band** is a **Magic Item** that can be used to temporarily befriend up to 9 **Pig**s or **Bunnymen** in close vicinity, something that otherwise can only be done by feeding them. It requires 2 **Gold Nugget**s, 4 **Nightmare Fuel**, and 2 **Pig Skin**s to craft and a **Prestihatitator** to prototype.

- **Wanda:** "I can play all these instruments at once, what a time saver!"
- **Choose:** willow

## Mechanics

The One-man Band is worn on the body and will drain the character's **Sanity** at a rate of 2 points per minute. Each Pig or Bunnyman befriended with the One-man Band will drain additional 25 Sanity points per minute. With the max of 9 followers, this means losing Sanity at 227 points per minute.

The device lasts for 3 minutes (4.5 game hours), degrading when equipped. Once a character stops playing the band, the followers will only stay loyal for a few seconds. Pigs and Bunnymen don't immediately stop following and doing the player's bidding, which means that the player should use it at short bursts instead of keeping it equipped constantly, to avoid big sanity drops.

The One-man Band does not draw Pigs out of their **Pig Houses** or Bunnymen out of their **Rabbit Hutches**.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, the One-man Band can be bought for 40 **Oinc**s at **The Flying Pig Arcane Shop** in the **Pig City**. Using the One-man Band will make **Pig Traders** and Guard Pigs allies.

## Trivia

- The One-man Band was added in **A Little Rain Must Fall** update.
- The One-man Band in real life is the name given to street performers, who play multiple instruments at the same time by moving their legs and arms. The sanity loss might be due to the cliche of people disliking these musicians, or the immensely tiring physical movement required to keep the whole band working.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, Bananas take on a more yellow appearance. They are dropped by Jungle Trees when the trees are cut down therefore are easier and safer to obtain than their underground counterparts. They also have a chance to be dropped by the Slot Machine when three carrots are rolled. Bananas can be used to cook Banana Pop; can be added to the Crock Pot as Fruit fillers and are worth 1 fruit value. They are required to craft Silly Monkey Balls and Prime Ape Huts.

Additionally, Bananas are eaten by Prime Apes and can be fed to them to befriend them. Wilbur gains 10 Sanity when eating Bananas.

## Usage
- **Cooking**: Cave Banana → Cooked Cave Banana
- **Manure**: Cave Bananas → Manure
- **Banana Pop**: Banana, Ice, Twigs, Filler → Banana Pop
- **Silly Monkey Ball**: Banana, Snakeskin, Rope → Silly Monkey Ball
- **Prime Ape Hut**: Banana, Manure, Twigs → Prime Ape Hut

## Trivia
- The Cave Banana is one of the few items in the game with examination quotes for Wilbur.
- The raw image for the Banana shows multiple bananas in one bunch, but the Cooked image shows only three, which seem to be poorly prepared. This could hint to poor cooking/preparation due to abnormal food.
- Wickerbottom's quote mentions that all of the bananas are genetically identical. This is probably a reference to the concern from botanists over the
