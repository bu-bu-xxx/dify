## Description
The **Skyworthy** is the **Hamlet** DLC's equivalent of **Shipwrecked**'s **Seaworthy**. It is found in the **Magic Tab**, requires 4 **Nightmare Fuel**, 4 **Living Logs**, and the **Can of Silly String** to craft, and a **Shadow Manipulator** to prototype.

### Travel Capabilities
The Skyworthy allows the player to travel to both a **Shipwrecked** or vanilla/ **Reign of Giants** world (if DLCs are installed). It may be crafted again to travel back to the **Hamlet** world. In **Shipwrecked** or vanilla/ **Reign of Giants** worlds, the required **Can of Silly String** may be found by **hammering** a **Wicker Basket** which is generated somewhere in the world. Can of Silly String can also be obtained in the **Royal Gallery** in the **Hamlet** world. Once traveled to a different world, the player can also find/craft the **Seaworthy** to use for travel between **Shipwrecked** and **Reign of Giants** worlds.

## Tips
- A Skyworthy tends to prioritize linking to another Skyworthy in another connected world (the same applies to the Seaworthy). With this mechanism, a player can utilize it for quick travel in a **Hamlet**-compatible world. For example, with a **Hamlet**-compatible **Shipwrecked** world, the player can build a Skyworthy in their main base and then build a Seaworthy near a **Slot Machine** in a different island. To quick travel to the Slot Machine the player must have a connected vanilla/ **Reign of Giants** (RoG) world with a Skyworthy and a Seaworthy built next to each other (the player must obtain the Sea Worther and the Can of Silly String to craft them). Use the Skyworthy to go

# Oscillating Fan

## Exclusivity to Hamlet
The Oscillating Fan is a craftable structure that is exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC.

## Structure Information
- **Icon**: ![Oscillating Fan](Oscillating_Fan.png)
- **Ingredients**:
  - **Alloy**: 2x
  - **Electrical Doodad**: 2x
  - **Gears**: 1x
- **Tab**: Science
- **Tier**: 2
- **Description**: Relieves hay fever, keeps you dry.
- **Spawn Code**: "basefan"
- **Image**: ![Oscillating Fan Build](Oscillating_Fan_Build.png)
- **Perk**:
  - Prevents the effects of **Hay Fever**.
  - Dries the player off.
- **Durability**: 5 days

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: Fan-tastic.
- **Willow**: Fan the flames.
- **Wolfgang**: Is cool on Wolfgang skin.
- **Wendy**: Alas the relief it brings is only temporary.
- **WX-78**: COOLING FAN.
- **Wickerbottom**: Restorative.
- **Woodie**: Yep. That's a nice breeze.
- **Maxwell**: Ah. Civilization.
- **Wagstaff**: Magnificent! What a marvel of engineering!
- **Wigfrid**: Cönquers the heat!
- **Webber**: That breeze feels nice on our fur.
- **Walani**: A nice breeze.
- **Warly**: Good ventilation in the kitchen is a must.
- **Woodlegs**: A cool wind blows from thee!
- **Warbucks**: Ah. A nice cooling breeze.
- **Wilba**: BLOW WINDS!
- **Wormwood**: Wind
- **Wheeler**: A plane propeller would be better.

## Crafting and Usage
The Oscillating Fan is found in the Science Tab and requires 2 Alloys, 2 Electrical Doodads, and 1 Gear to craft. It also requires an Alchemy Engine to prototype. While active, the fan prevents the effects of Hay Fever and will dry the player off very rapidly (5 times as fast) even in Fog or Rain as long as the player is within a certain range of the fan. The fan can be turned on or off and will automatically turn off when it runs out of fuel. The player is able to refuel it with regular Fire Fuel items along with Nitre. In the Shipwrecked DLC, the Oscillating Fan can be flooded.

## Bug Note
- The Oscillating Fan accepts an infinite amount of fuel, therefore wasting any additional fuel given that would surpass its 5 days limit.

## Category
- Science Tab
```

The above markdown format provides a clear and organized representation of the information provided about the Oscillating Fan. Each section is clearly defined with headers, and the quotes are listed with their respective characters. The crafting information and usage notes are also included for a comprehensive understanding of the structure.

## Scrapbook Info
Improves vision in a storm.<br><br>Will help locate mysterious holograms.

The Astroggles is a craftable item exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. It requires 2 Moon Shards and 1 Potato to craft. A Sewing Kit repairs 100% of its durability. The Rare Blueprint required to craft the Astroggles will be given to players by Wagstaff the first time they enter a Moonstorm. The durability of Astroggles is restored by 10% each time a Moongleam crackles with electricity near one, whether it is on the floor, or on a player carrying or wearing one.

When walking in a Sandstorm or Moonstorm while wearing Astroggles, the character will not be slowed down and the visual effects that are limiting the player's field of view will be largely reduced.

While wearing Astroggles in a Moonstorm, a directional indicator will be visible that points to Wagstaff's current location if he is nearby, similar to those shown for other players.

## Tips
- Due to its relatively low durability, it is advised to either wear chest armor while wearing Astroggles in a Moonstorm in order to not take too much damage when recharging the Astroggles via Moongleam, or to bring a Sewing Kit.
- It may be desirable for a player to bring two Astroggles and switch them out periodically, as being shocked by a Moongleam restores the durability of all Astroggles in a player's inventory.
  - Alternatively, bring Desert Goggles along because of its 10x longer durability (using Astroggles to find Wagstaff, and switching to Desert Goggles otherwise).

## Trivia
- The Astroggles was introduced in the Return of Them#Eye of the Storm update.

The **Tar Lamp** is a craftable **Light** **Item** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It requires a **Seashell** and some **Tar** to craft. It has the same burn time as a **Torch** (75 seconds), and is similarly affected by **Strong Winds** and **Rain**. It can be equipped to the hand slot, or placed on the ground or water similar to a **Bottle Lantern**, where it can be turned on or off. Tar Lamps can also be attached to **Boats** in the lantern slot.

Tar Lamps can be refueled to 100% with a single **Tar**. If the Tar Lamp is on the ground when it is depleted, it will drop ash.

## Trivia
- Tar Lamps were added to the **Shipwrecked** DLC more than a year after its official completion in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked#November 21st, 2017 - Home Sea Home Update**, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.
- When right clicking on a Tar Lamp equipped to the hand slot, instead of being unequipped, it will be turned off, but remain equipped.

- The **Loyal Arcane Crystalarium** skin was awarded for watching 6 hours of "Don't Starve Together" on Twitch from November 26, 2020 to December 15, 2020. It is also available in the Klei Rewards shop for 1,200 Klei points.
- The **Woven - Elegant Alchemy Table** skin was introduced in the "[[An Eye for An Eye]]" update in 2021, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's "Terraria". Its rarity was **Inspired - Elegant** initially, but received a change in August 19, 2022.
- The **Proof of Purchase All-Chemical Engine** skin is obtained by purchasing the Wilson YooTooze.

## Tips
- An easy way to gather the crafting materials for an Alchemy Engine is to hammer down Pig Houses for Boards and Cut Stones, and to mine Gold Vein Boulders for Gold.
- The Alchemy Engine is able to unlock Tier 1 items without the need for a nearby Science Machine, so it may be beneficial to break down the Science Machine for resources after building it.
- Since Wickerbottom has Tier 2 items unlocked with the Science Machine, this machine is only necessary for crafting her book On Tentacles.

## Trivia
- In the early Beta version of "Don't Starve", the game used a "Research Points" system, instead of prototyping. Crafting this station cost 200 Research Points.
- As of the "Hungry For Your Hunger" update, Tier 3 recipes crafted using the Shadow Manipulator have been moved to the Alchemy Engine, due to the separation of Science and Magic.

## Description
Palmcone Trees are Plants exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in The Curse of Moon Quay update. They can be found on Moon Quay Island. They are renewable through the Palmcone Sprouts dropped from an Unnatural Portal. Chopping a tall Palmcone Tree will drop 3 Logs along with 2 Palmcone Scales and 1 Palmcone Sprout. Digging its stump will result in 2 additional Logs.

## Tips
- As Palmcone Trees only drop 1 Palmcone Sprout at their Tall stage, the only way to plant more Palmcone Trees is through the Unnatural Portal.
- Palmcone Trees are a great alternative to Evergreens, as they drop more logs and Palmcone Scales, which are required to craft the Cannon Kit and Dock Kit.
- Palmcone Trees do not spawn Tree Guards, allowing for repeated log harvests using Bearger's charge attack without putting Bearger at risk.

'''Evil Flowers''' are a type of Flower that spawn around the [[Wooden Thing]], most [[Set Piece]]s for the other [[Things]], [[Totally Normal Tree]]s, certain other set pieces, and [[Maxwell's Door]]. Evil Flowers provide [[Dark Petals]] when picked. Evil Flowers act the same as regular flowers, spawning Butterflies and attracting Bees. New Evil Flowers can spawn if an unpicked Evil Flower is pollinated by a homeless Bee. In the [[Don't Starve|base game]], if no unpicked Evil Flowers are available, there is no way to obtain more.

Evil Flowers drain 25 Sanity in a minute when stood by, 5 when picked, and 5 more if the player eats the Dark Petals it provides. Since the Dark Petals don't have any sort of purpose when eaten and only drain Sanity, it is advised that the player not eat them unless they want to purposely lower their Sanity to fight [[Shadow Creature]]s or move [[Obelisk]]s. 4 Dark Petals can also be crafted into [[Nightmare Fuel]].
==Cultivation==
Using Evil Flowers is one of the few ways to acquire [[Nightmare Fuel]] without lowering Sanity to low levels sanity or insanity inducing items. For this reason, it may be of interest for players to cultivate Evil Flowers as a means of supplementing their supply of Nightmare Fuel. Unlike normal Flowers, Evil Flowers cannot be manually planted.

The player should begin by crafting a Bug Net and capturing some number of Bees. Once captured, these Bees; become "homeless" and will not return to their hive. After releasing these Bees near some existing Evil Flowers, they will begin to visit them as they would normally. It is also necessary for the player to be near the area the Bees are working, since the bee's AI routine will not run if the player is too far away.

Bees must visit 6 different flowers before they can plant another flower. The flower that is planted will depend upon which type of flowers the 6 were, so as soon as you have 6 evil flowers in the area it is a good idea to eliminate any normal flowers so the evil flower chance becomes 100%. Most often the Bees will plant the flower after the 6th flower is visited, but there is a small chance it will visit another flower or land without planting. Clearing the area of [[Tree]]s, Grass etc.

The **Boat Lantern** is a craftable Boat attachment in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It requires a Science Machine to prototype and 1 Empty Bottle, 2 Twigs, and 1 Firefly to craft, and can be found in the Light Tab. It is also a reward from the Yaarctopus in exchange for Surf 'n' Turf.

The Boat Lantern needs to be attached to a boat to function. When it is attached to a Boat, it can be turned on or off at will, providing light when turned on, which protects the player from Charlie. It has limited durability and will eventually run out if kept on, but can be refilled with Bioluminescence or Fireflies to extend its lifespan.

## Tips
- The Slot Machine may occasionally drop Fireflies, turning it into an unreliable way to obtain Fireflies if one has enough Dubloons and luck.
- If playing in a Shipwrecked world that has been connected with a base game world, Light Bulbs can be used to recharge the Boat Lantern.

## Description
The **Hollow Stump** is a naturally-spawning object from the **Reign of Giants** DLC, found only in a **Deciduous Forest** Biome. It is a large stump with a hole, with yarn hanging from its branches and a ball of yarn on the side. It is the home of a **Catcoon**.

A Hollow Stump initially starts with 9 Catcoon lives. The life counter decreases every time a Catcoon from the stump is killed, and the Hollow Stump regenerates one Catcoon life every 120 seconds. If a Hollow Stump runs out of lives completely, the stump will go into an "empty" state. It will never spawn another Catcoon and will serve no purpose other than to be hammered down for its resources. Despite appearing to be mostly destroyed, a Hollow Stump in this state will drop the same number of items as a functional one.

Spawned Catcoons wander within 30 tiles of their Hollow Stump.

## Drops
| Chance | Item |

## Trivia
- **Catcoons** spawning a total of 9 times, as well as the cat having 9 unique "gifts", is a reference to the myth that cats have 9 lives.
- Despite **Catcoons** being hostile towards Wortox, he still calls it "A home for friends".

## Bugs
- Sometimes **Catcoons** will attempt to enter a hammered Hollow Stump, resulting in them repeatedly hissing indefinitely.

## Petrification Process
Petrification affects all stages of Evergreens. A default world can start with Petrified Trees in place of Boulders or some Evergreens may become petrified after a random amount of time. The first petrification occurs between the 44th and 65th day, with subsequent petrifications happening every 21 to 32 days.

Petrification begins with one random Evergreen or Lumpy Evergreen chosen as the center. All trees within a 9 tile radius, with the condition that the distance between two trees is no further than 2.4 tiles, will be petrified. The number of these trees must be less than 20% of all the Evergreens before Petrification; otherwise, they will remain as Evergreens.

When petrification starts, Characters will hear a noise from nearby trees (if they are close enough to the area about to be petrified), and shortly after, all the trees in the area will become petrified.

After petrification, trees can no longer be chopped down with an Axe but can be mined with a Pickaxe. Petrified Trees do not grow, so they will remain in the same stage of growth when they were transformed.

## Drops from Petrified Evergreens

| Size   | Rocks       | Flint       | Nitre      |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Short  | 1.35 (1 + 35%) | 0.25 (25%) | 0.25 (25%) |
| Normal | 1.75 (1 + 75%) | 0.25 (25%) | 0.40 (40%) |
| Tall   | 2.35 (2 + 35%) | 0.75 (75%) | 0.65 (65%) |
| Old    | 1.00 (25% to get 0, 50% to get 1, 25% to get 2) | 0.75 (75%) | 0.25 (25%) |

## Trivia
- Petrified Trees are considered part of A New Reign, even though they were introduced before the official start of the beta branch.
- In real life, petrification of trees occurs when a tree gets submerged in mineral-rich water. As the tree rots away, most of the minerals are left behind still in a tree shape.
- Trees make a faint rock crunching sound as they petrify.
- If players aren't careful, wood may become very scarce or even go extinct due to this mechanic. However, due to the Regrowth mechanic, trees will be able to come back from being extinct, taking at least 50 days.

## Description

Celestial Fissures are naturally-spawning objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. They are found on the **Lunar Island**. They produce both light and an **Enlightenment**-increasing aura depending on the **Moon Cycle**, from no light and aura at New Moon to a large light and 100 Enlightenment/minute at Full Moon.

The **Celestial Altar** can be built by assembling the altar components on top of a Celestial Fissure. A **Celestial Tribute** can also be placed in one. Both structures access the same portion of the **Celestial Crafting Tab**.

## Trivia

- Celestial Fissures were introduced in the **Return of Them#Turn of Tides** update.
- Celestial Fissures can be thought of as the lunar counterparts to **Nightmare Fissures**. Both are holes in the ground that release more or less light depending on their respective cycles (**Moon Cycle** for Celestial Fissures, **Nightmare Cycle** for **Nightmare Fissures**), and that increase Enlightenment or **Insanity** respectively.

- **Resources:** ![Gold Dust](Pic32|Gold Dust)

- Woodlegs: Alas, not big enough to sail in.
- Wilba: ALL THAT GLITTERS 'TIS GOLD
- Wormwood: Shiny puddle
- Wheeler: A sparkly pool. A little too sparkly.
- Choose: Wigfrid

### Description

The **Sparkling Pool** is a naturally spawning item introduced in the **Hamlet** DLC. It can be found in the **Painted** Biome. **Pangoldens** drink from it lowering pool's stage. Player can use **Gold Pan** on the pool to receive one **Gold Dust** per stage. Sparking Pool can be drunk from / used up to 3 times before going dormant and invisible. The art changes depending on the stage.

Dormant pool has a 20% chance to reappear again during **Rain**. Stage 1 and 2 Sparkling Pools will always collect rain to eventually refill itself to the stage 3. It takes about 3 minutes of rain to refill the pool one stage up.

### Prototype Tips

To make gold panning more reliable, players should prevent the pools from going into a dormant state. This can be achieved by eliminating pangoldens in the area or fencing the pools off. When using a gold pan on the pool, players should only use it up to two times on a stage 3 pool, ensuring that the stage 1 pool will refill itself during the next rain.

# Anchor Kit

## Description
The **Anchor Kit** is a craftable item exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. It is found in the **Seafaring Filter**, requires two **Boards**, three **Cut Stone**s and three **Rope**s to craft, and a **Think Tank** to prototype.

## Usage
The Anchor Kit can be deployed on a **Boat**. The Anchor can then be lowered to prevent the Boat from drifting, or be raised to allow it to move again. The time it takes for the Anchor to rise depends on the depth of the Ocean:
- 2 seconds on **Coastal Ocean** and **Brine Shoals**
- 6 seconds on **Swell Ocean**
- 8 seconds in **Rough Ocean**
- 10 seconds in **Hazardous Ocean**

The time it takes for it to lower is a third of the raising time.

If an Anchor is hammered, it will leave a boat leak in its place.

A thing to keep in mind is that the anchor will not prevent the boat from drifting away if the sails are still open. They need to be closed, otherwise the boat will still drift away slowly.

## Skins
* The **Loyal Rusty Anchor** skin was awarded for watching 6 hours of **Don't Starve Together** on Twitch from June 2, 2022 to June 16, 2022.

![Loyal Rusty Anchor](Rusty_Anchor_Icon.png)

## Trivia
- The Anchor Kit was introduced in the **Turn of Tides** update.
- If the Anchor is on land it clinks against the ground.

## Wood Gates
Wood Gates are craftable Structures. They require an Alchemy Engine to be crafted from 2 Boards and 1 Rope. Wood Gates can be opened and closed by the player, either by clicking on them or by pressing 'Space' while standing next to them. Together with Wood Fences, they can be used to pen Mobs. Wood Gates are flammable and can be destroyed with a Hammer, which will return all of their crafting ingredients. Wood Gates placed next to each other will always form a double gate and always open and close together.

## Skins
- The Woven - Distinguished Ash Picket Gate, Walnut Picket Gate, and White Garden Gate skins were introduced during the official Year of the Carrat event in 2020.
- The Woven - Distinguished Wrought Iron Gate, Antique Brass Gate, and Antique Bronze Gate skins were introduced during the official Year of the Beefalo event in 2021.
- The Woven - Elegant Gingerbread Gate skin was introduced during the official Winter's Feast event in 2019.

## Trivia
- The Wood Gate was introduced to Don't Starve Together in the A New Reign update during A New Reign. It was later added to Don't Starve in the Quality of Life update.
- Wood Gates used to consist of two doors until their art was updated to support building double gates.
- Wood Gates will always open in the same direction, no matter on which side the player is standing or how they were rotated when placed.

## Bugs
- Placing Wood Gates to become a double gate can be difficult if they are placed in a gap between two fence ends. It is recommended to remove the fence on one side and place the gates beforehand.
- Visually, Wood Gates do not work well with Walls of any kind. In certain angles they can look as if they were floating above them.

# Ocean Trawler

## Exclusivity
*Don't Starve Together*

## Overview
The **Ocean Trawler** automatically catches **Ocean Fish** after lowering the net into the water. The four inventory slots can be filled with food items as bait to increase the chance of catching ocean fish. The bait must fit the respective fish's diet. If the device is deployed near fish schools, the fish will try to eat the bait and be caught by the net, as a result of which up to four fish can be taken out of the trawler. However, after the trawler fills completely, it must be raised back in time before the net snaps, releasing all of the fish and wasting all of the time, bait, and effort spent waiting for it to collect fish.

Fish inside the trawler spoil 90% slower. If the trawler is lowered into the water and completely full, it doubles the chances for **Rockjaws**, **Skittersquids**, and **Gnarwails** to spawn nearby.

## Quotes
- **Raised empty net**: 
  - *Walter:* Nets sure do make fishing easier.
  - *Wanda:* Thank goodness, now I don't have to waste my time fishing!
  - *...*

- **Lowered net**: 
  - *Walter:* Soon I'll be roasting fish over a campfire.
  - *Wanda:* It will catch fish while I see to more pressing matters.
  - *...*

- **Raised full net**: 
  - *Walter:* Look at all those fish!
  - *Wanda:* Well that worked nicely!
  - *...*

- **Broken net**: 
  - *Walter:* Darnit, they got away!
  - *Wanda:* Oh botheration, I didn't make it back in time.
  - *...*

It is also found in the **Survival Tab**, is always available to craft, but instead of using **Cut Grass**, it requires 3 **Palm Leaves** to craft. Similar to the Pretty Parasol, it is an easier to craft replacement for the **Umbrella**.

While equipped, it provides protection against **Wetness** and **Overheating**, and slowly restores **Sanity**. After it is crafted, it will slowly perish over time whether or not it is equipped. Unlike the **Pretty Parasol**, it cannot be used as **Fuel**.

There is a chance to acquire this item while spending **Dubloons** at the **Slot Machine**.

# Water Balloon

The **Water Balloon** is a craftable **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It can be used to extinguish **Fire**s by throwing it at the fire. Here are its specifications:

## Structure Infobox
- **Equip Slot**: Hands
- **Range**: 10
- **Icon**: ![Water Balloon](Water Balloon.png)
- **Image**: ![Water Balloon Dropped](Water Balloon Dropped.png)
- **Description**: Spheroid fire suppression.
- **Tier**: 1
- **Filter**: ![Weapons Filter](Pic32|Weapons Filter) ![Summer Items Filter](Pic32|Summer Items Filter)
- **Ingredient 1**: Mosquito Sack (multiplier: 2)
- **Ingredient 2**: Ice (multiplier: 1)
- **Num to Give**: 4
- **Durability**: 1 use
- **Perk**: Puts out fires, causes wetness
- **Stack**: 20
- **Spawn Code**: "waterballoon"

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: What a scientific marvel!
- **Wendy**: At any moment it could pop and spill its guts.
- **WX-78**: KEEP THAT AWAY FROM MY CIRCUITS!
- **Wickerbottom**: A toy for children.
- **Woodie**: Could be fun times lobbin' these around.
- **Maxwell**: Do you have any idea how much this suit cost?
- **Wigfrid**: Prepare tö engage in water-y battle!

## Scrapbook Info
When thrown, it puts out fires in a small area where it lands. It will also cool targets by 5 degrees and adds 20 wetness.

## Crafting
The Water Balloon can be crafted with a **Science Machine** using 2 **Mosquito Sacks** and 1 **Ice**, which gives the player 4 water balloons. Alternatively, mosquito sacks can be filled at **Ponds**, however this only yields a single water balloon.

## Usage
- **Fire Extinguishing**: In addition to putting out fires in a small area, it also protects objects from catching fire for 30 seconds.
- **Temperature and Wetness**: Subtracts 5 degrees from players' temperatures and adds 20 **Wetness**. Only the players and the **Dragonfly** can get wetness from water balloons.
- **Special Cases**: If a player is 100% waterproof, the water balloon won't burst upon contact and will simply roll away, essentially wasting it.

## Tips
- **Dragonfly Fights**: Water Balloons can also be useful when fighting the **Dragonfly**, since players can throw them at themselves and at other players to cool them down and extinguish them if they are hit by **Lavae**.
- **Combination Weapons**: They are also very useful when used in conjunction with a **Morning Star**, **Electric Darts**, or **Volt Goat Chaud-Froid**.
- **PvP**: In PvP, getting these early is very effective against **WX-78**.
- **Farm Soil**: Water balloons can be used to moisturize farm soil.

## Trivia
Because they add wetness (which can cause **freezing** and **insanity**) and can be used to extinguish fires at night, Water Balloons could be used to kill other players even outside of PvP.

## Skins
- **Loyal Terrible Ooze Machine** skin was awarded for watching 6 hours of Don't Starve Together on Twitch from October 22, 2020 to November 26, 2020.
- **Loyal Celebratory Science Machine** was given out to everyone in honor of the decade of Don't Starve from April 27, 2023.

## Tips
- When [[Wickerbottom]] is near a Science Machine, it acts as an Alchemy Engine, as she is already able to craft tier 1 science items, making the Science Machine serve as a tier 2 Science station.
- Science machines may be hammered after an alchemy engine has been built to save resources.
- Wickerbottom should skip the Science machine when playing in DST to let others also use tier 2 science recipes.

## Trivia
- In the early Beta version of Don't Starve, the game used a "Research Points" system, instead of prototyping.
- Its old crafting description was "Probe the depths of the universe!".
- The main section of this machine bears a resemblance to the weighted storage cubes in Valve's Portal series.
- The Science Machine appears at the top of the screen when the game "Autosaves".

The **Steamer Trunk** is a new object introduced in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. There are two variations of Steamer Trunks. First variation can be found in **Deep Ocean** Biome. There are 4 Steamer Trunks of this variation in the world, and each contains a few usable items and a **Trinket** that can be traded to **Yaarctopus** for **Dubloons**. The contents of these are preset, and each trunk contains a different preset. The second variation is found in the **Ship Graveyard** Biome. There are 4 to 8 Steamer Trunks of this variation in the world, and each contain a randomly generated set of common items in them.

Both variations function like a **Chest** with 9 inventory slots and have a **Map** icon, allowing player to easily find them again after sailing away. They can be used as storage on Ocean even after original contents are removed.

## Possible Contents
Steamer Trunks found in the Deep Ocean contain one of the following sets of items. All sets are available in different trunks around the world.

| {{pic|30|Floral Shirt}} {{pic|30|Umbrella}} {{pic|30|Coconut}} &times;2 {{pic|30|Orange Soda|Trinkets#Orange Soda}} |
| {{pic|30|Summer Frest}} {{pic|30|Dumbrella}} {{pic|30|Coconade}} &times;2 {{pic|30|Voodoo Doll|Trinkets#Voodoo Doll}} |

For Steamer Trunks found in the Ship Graveyards, contents are randomly generated. Only a single item from each row from the following table can be found in a single chest, and items from rows with less than 100% chance may not be present at all. The durability or the amount of items vary as indicated, and all options are equally likely.

| Possible items | Chance to appear | Durability<br />or Amount |
| {{pic|32|Log Suit}} {{pic|32|Straw Hat} | 25% | 15%-55% |
| {{pic|32|Axe}} {{pic|32|Machete}} {{pic|32|Shovel}} {{pic|32|Pickaxe}} | 100% | 15%-65% |
| {{pic|32|Flint}} {{pic|32|Dubloons}} | 50% | 1-3 |
| {{pic|32|Coral}} {{pic|32|Seaweed}} | 100% | 3-5 |

Note that **Seaweed** in the trunks is created at world generation time, and if the trunk is not found quickly, it will turn to **Rot**.

## Trivia
* A **Steamer Trunk**, less commonly known as a Cabin Trunk, is a kind of travel luggage built to fit into various spaces

# Honey Chest

## Description
Honey Chests are a type of [Chest] exclusive to the [Don't Starve: Hamlet] DLC. They have 9 slots and can be found within Mant Hills.

These chests have the unique ability to turn Nectar into Honey after 1/10 of a day (48 seconds) of being in the chest. The player does not have to leave the Mant Hill for this transformation to occur.

Upon finding a Honey Chest, it will likely be filled with 9 Honey, one per slot. The player does not have to spread their Nectar out this way, however. For example, placing a stack of 20 Nectar in one slot will produce a stack of 20 Honey in its place.

Nectar and Honey will not spoil while inside the chest.

Honey chests can be hammered, however, they are not craftable and yield nothing, so it is not recommended.

## Description
Ancient Obelisks are naturally spawning structures exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. They replace Nightmare Lights in the Atrium Biome of the Ruins. Instead of activating during specific Nightmare phases, Ancient Obelisks are activated by inserting the Ancient Key in the Ancient Gateway. Unlike the Nightmare Light, the Obelisk's insanity aura is not dependent on it being active. At 800 sanity drained per minute, its effect is similar to that of a fully-open nightmare light, and players should avoid standing close to one, unless they have the means to restore the sanity and get past the Obelisk blockades.

# Lightning Rod

The **Lightning Rod** is a [Science] Structure that attracts [Lightning] strikes. It requires 4 [Gold Nugget]s and 1 [Cut Stone] to craft and a [Science Machine] to prototype.

## Description
Protection from strikes.

## Ingredients
- **Gold Nugget**: 4x
- **Cut Stone**: 1x

## Features
- **Filter**: [Structures Filter] [Rain Gear Filter]
- **Tier**: 1
- **Perk**: Harnesses lightning.
- **Spawn Code**: "lightning_rod"

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: Now I can harness the heavens!
- **Willow**: All the lightning can come here!
- **Wolfgang**: Is wire in sky!
- **Wendy**: Focuses the destruction.
- **WX-78**: SURGE PROTECTION
- **Wickerbottom**: Highly conductive!
- **Wigfrid**: Bring with you lightning Dönner!
- **Woodie**: Weather's not going to get the drop on me now.
- **Maxwell**: A little bit of protection.
- **Wagstaff**: Attracts the electrostatic discharge of a lightning strike.
- **Webber**: This might keep us safe.
- **Walani**: It's powered by electricity.
- **Warly**: I do feel a bit safer now.
- **Woodlegs**: Protectin' me from th' 'eavens.
- **Wilba**: 'TIS BIG METAL STICK
- **Wormwood**: Zzzzt Stick
- **Wheeler**: Does disguising itself like lightning help it do its job?
- **Winona**: That's one way to get electricity.
- **Wortox**: It's brimming with elemental energy.
- **Wurt**: Scale-less can call down lightning?
- **Walter**: That's where we keep the lightning.
- **Wanda**: Just in case the sky starts getting any funny ideas.

## Scrapbook Info
Lightning that would strike nearby will instead strike this, charging it.

## Protection Radius
Lightning Rod protects from Lightning strikes that originate 10 [Tile]s from the lightning rod's placement spot. A single lightning rod thus only provides 2.5 tiles radius of lightning-proof coverage for the player. The area between 2.5 and 10 tiles radius has some lightning protection, but it is not 100%.

## Optimal Placement
Placing a lightning rod every 14 Tiles would optimize the number of lightning rods for 100% lightning coverage. 2-4 lightning rods are recommended for a base of 1-6 Ice Flingomatics.

## Light Source
The Lightning Rod also provides a small radius of light (but not heat) after absorbing a Lightning bolt, which is just bright enough to prevent [Charlie (Night Monster)] from attacking. The light lasts for up to a 1440 seconds, but the light will darken at daybreak after 960 seconds.

## WX-78 Charging
WX-78 can use a recently-struck Lightning Rod to charge its meter.

## Skins
- **Loyal Smite'ning Rod**: Awarded for watching 6 hours of Don't Starve Together on Twitch from March 25, 2021 to April 8, 2021. Also available in the Klei Rewards shop for 1,200 Klei points.
- **Electrobolt Diffuser 300X**: Woven - Elegant. Divert lightning bolts away from your body in style with the Electrobolt Diffuser 300X!
- **Experimental Energy Siphon**: Woven - Elegant. Lightning - the energy source of the future!
- **Gothic Thundercaller**: Woven - Elegant. Call down lightning from dark, brooding storm clouds.
- **Smite'ning Rod**: Loyal. Woe to this poor fish in particular.

## Tips
On a boat, using a [Lightning Conductor] can save room that would have been taken up by the lightning rod.

## Trivia
The Lightning Rod was added in the '[Doorway To Adventure]' update.

After a Ticoon is summoned, it will start walking towards the nearest undiscovered Kitcoon and periodically stop and wait for the player to follow before continuing on. If the player goes in another direction the Ticoon will follow, but when the player stops moving it will hiss and turn back towards the direction of the Kitcoon, waiting for the player to follow.

Once the Ticoon is close to the hidden Kitcoon it will stop. An "Investigate" option will appear when hovering over the object the Kitcoon is hidden behind. Once investigated, the Kitcoon will come out and drop a Large [Red Pouch]. The Ticoon will then disappear and another Ticoon can be summoned to find another Kitcoon.

To dismiss a Ticoon, the player can kill the Ticoon or right click the Ticoon to abandon it.

### Description
The Moon Dial is a craftable structure exclusive to [[Don't Starve Together]], introduced in [[A New Reign]]. It is found in the [[Magic Filter]] or [[Structures Filter]], requires a [[Moonlens|Blue Moonlens]], 2 [[Moon Rock]] and 2 [[Ice]] to craft, and a [[Prestihatitator]] to prototype.

The Moon Dial can be used to track the [[Moon Cycle]], which is reflected in the water inside the structure. The closer the world is to a full moon, the higher the water level will be, with the Moon Dial overflowing during a full moon. It also provides light depending on the current moon phase, with the new moon causing the Moon Dial to emit no light, and the full moon causing it to emit the most light.

During nighttime, the player may inspect the dial for a different quote, depending on where the moon is in the cycle. A Moon Dial built in the Caves will not work, and character examination quotes will be different.

The Moon Dial can be useful when playing as [[Woodie]], as it can be a more obvious indicator of when a Full Moon is about to occur.

When the [[Mysterious Energy]] is summoned, the Moon Dial will glass over. After the [[Celestial Champion]] is defeated, the Moon Dial will drop a [[Moon Shard]].
