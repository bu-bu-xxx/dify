## Description

Unimportant (Stone) Pillars are naturally spawning objects found in some rooms of Ancient Pig Ruins or Cave Cleft in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. While mining them with a Pickaxe, each hit will cause a brief Earthquake, similar to those naturally occurring in the Caves. After six hits, the Unimportant Pillar will be destroyed, causing an extended earthquake and leaving a useless pile of rock marking where it used to be.

During the earthquake, Items and Mobs (such as Moleworms) may fall from the ceiling. The end of the earthquake can cause nearby Suspicious Cracks to break, possibly revealing a hidden room.

## Tips

- The player is recommended to prepare a Light Source before mining Unimportant Pillars as there is a chance for hostile Mobs like Scorpions and Rabid Beetles to fall from the ceiling.
- Armor is also recommended, as falling rocks will damage the player.
- There is no effect to knocking down all of the pillars in a room, despite the quakes and falling debris. Ultimately, the name "Unimportant Pillar" proves accurate.
- The chance to open Suspicious Cracks happens when the earthquake is finished, so the player can mine an Unimportant Pillar in one room and quickly move to another while the shaking is still going on and open the cracks in the second room. This is a good way to check if there are rooms behind cracks without using resources like gunpowder or magnifying glasses.

# Night Armor

## Overview
The **Night Armor** is a **Magic** **Armor** often paired with a **Dark Sword**. It requires 5 **Nightmare Fuel** and 3 **Papyrus** to craft and a **Shadow Manipulator** to prototype. It is one of **Maxwell**'s starting items in the single player game.

## Details
- **Durability**: 750 hp
- **Physical Damage Absorption**: 95%
- **Sanity Drain**: -10/min
- **Sanity Drain from Damage**: Decreases Sanity by 10% of total damage taken
- **Stacking**: Does not stack
- **Perk**: Decreases sanity by 10% of total damage taken.
- **Spawn Code**: "armor_sanity"
- **Description**: Protects your body, but not your mind.
- **Dropped By**:
  - {{Pic|24|Ancient Pseudoscience Station}} ({{Pic|24|Hammer}})
  - {{Pic|24|Level 3 Shadow Knight}}
  - {{Pic|24|Level 3 Shadow Bishop}}
  - {{Pic|24|Level 3 Shadow Rook}}
- **Sold By**: {{Pic32|The Flying Pig Arcane Shop}} ({{Pic|24|Oinc}} ×20) {{Pic|24|Hamlet icon}}
- **Protection**: 95%

## Downloadable Content
In the **Hamlet** DLC, Night Armors can be bought for 20 **Oinc**s at **The Flying Pig Arcane Shop** in **Pig City**. Night Armors can be used to craft a **Vortex Cloak**.

## Usage
**Recipe** for **Vortex Cloak**:
- **Night Armor**: 1
- **Dark Tatters**: 5
- **Tool**: Blueprint
- **Result**: Vortex Cloak
- **DLC**: Hamlet

## Tips
- It is useful to also equip a head-slot item which can boost **Sanity**, such as the **Tam o' Shanter**, helping to offset the sanity drain while still having very high physical protection.
- The Night Armor is especially useful on **Wanda** in her old form, nullifying the sanity drain, and allowing her to benefit from the bonus damage on shadow weapons, while staying more safe.

## Trivia
- The Night Armor was added in the **Insanity!** update.
- When paired with the **Shelmet** or the **Thulecite Crown**, the player is able to absorb 99.5% of incoming damage, enough to survive a **Gunpowder** explosion, losing 1 **Hp** and 20 **Sanity**.
- **Wickerbottom** states the armor transfers the damage into another dimension.
- The Night Armor makes a "warping" noise when the player moves while wearing it.

- **Wanda:** "I haven't spent much time practicing..."

## Downloadable Content
- **In Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC, the Pan Flute has a 75% chance to be found around the Glommer's Statue.**
- **In Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC, the Pan Flute can rarely be found when fishing with the Trawl Net, making it renewable.**
- **In Hamlet DLC, the Pan Flute is renewable since Mandrakes can be bought in 'The Sty' Oddities Emporium for 50 Oincs.**

## Trivia
- **Pan Flutes are named after [Pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)), the Greek god of animals and music.**
- **The Pan Flute is one of the 6 ways to put mobs to sleep, with the other methods being the Sleep Dart, Life Giving Amulet, Wickerbottom's book Sleepytime Stories, and eating or cooking a Mandrake.**
- **Using a Pan Flute near a Bird in flight will cause it to fall to the ground, ready to be picked up for a short time.**
- **It is also apparently Wortox's flute, according to his character quote. This would make sense as the Pan Flute is shown to be shadow magic, and Wortox is an imp, which, according to folklore, dabble in the dark arts.**
  - **It is also shown in the portrait for his Verdant skin, which has similarities to Satyrs, who would use Pan Flutes in folk tales.**
- **Making a Pan Flute out of a Mandrake is a much more efficient use of a Mandrake, as cooking and eating Mandrakes only have two uses, destroy the Mandrake, and also put the user to sleep. Pan Flutes have ten uses, but if used only nine times can be renewed with Deconstruction Staves, and do not put the user to sleep.**

The **Obsidian Axe** is another version of Axe exclusive to **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It requires 1 Axe, 1 Dragoon Heart, and 2 Obsidian to craft. The Obsidian Axe is also a possible reward from **X Marks the Spot** treasure chests. Like all items in the **Volcanic Tab**, it cannot be prototyped and the player must be wearing a Brain of Thought or be near an **Obsidian Workbench** to craft it again.

The Obsidian Axe can be used to chop down **Trees** with 2.5 times the efficiency of the standard Axe, in addition to having 250 uses, which is 2.5 times of the uses for the standard version. Small Trees will take 2 hits, medium Trees will take 4 hits, and large Trees will take 6 hits to chop down.

As the Obsidian Axe is used (either as a tool or a weapon), its charge level will increase. As the charge level increases, the Obsidian Axe will produce more heat and light, which protects the players from **Charlie**, but can cause **Overheating**. It can also be used as a weapon, initially dealing the same damage as the standard Axe per hit, but after gaining 75 charges, it will start igniting any target struck and deal up to 2x damage based on the number of charges. The charge level decreases over time as long as the axe isn't used and dropping it into the **Ocean** will completely remove its charge. An Obsidian Axe will not gain any charges during **Hurricane Season**. Similar to **Thermal Stone**, the Axe will start glowing as it gains charges.

Players should take caution when using an Obsidian Axe with high levels of charge, as any Tree ignited by the Obsidian Axe can potentially ignite other nearby trees, resources or **Structures**. Burnt Trees can be chopped down with a single strike with any axe to obtain **Charcoal**, and the Obsidian Axe will not reignite the burnt tree or the Charcoal. When using this item as a weapon, players should remember that the Mobs that are killed while on fire will drop **Cooked** variants of the **food** items and ashes for flammable resources they would otherwise

# Light Flowers

## Description
Light Flowers are plants that serve as sources of light that can normally be found in **Caves** and **Ruins**. They are generated all over the caves but mostly spawn in Cave Swamp, and **Wilds** in the Ruins.

## Details

  ![Springy Light Flower](Springy_Light_Flower.png)
  ![Double Light Flower](Double_Light_Flower.png)
  ![Triple Light Flower](Triple_Light_Flower.png)

- **Renewable**: Yes

- **Biomes**: 
  - Wilds
  - Light Flower Swamp
  - Lunar Grotto

- **Spawn Codes**: 
  - "flower_cave"
  - "flower_cave_double"
  - "flower_cave_triple"
  - "lightflier_flower"

- **Picked**: Can be picked (Light Bulb ×1-3)

- **Can Be Burned**: 1

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Science makes it glow."
- Willow: "It's burning inside."
- Wolfgang: "Is light plant."
- Wendy: "It looks fragile."
- WX-78: "POWER SOURCE: UNKNOWN"
- Wickerbottom: "You could read by that light."
- Woodie: "Shiny!"
- Maxwell: "It's so dark down here."
- Wagstaff: "Is it radioactive? I hope so."
- Wigfrid: "And it lit up the night, upon the darkest hour."
- Webber: "Oooh, a glowing ball of flower!"
- Walani: "I want a whole wreath of them!"
- Warly: "Ah, a light in the dark."
- Woodlegs: "That there be a pretty flower."
- Wilba: "WHAT LIGHT!"
- Wormwood: "Glowy friend"
- Wheeler: "It's growing projectiles!"
- Winona: "Woah! It doesn't even need electricity!"
- Wortox: "How kind of you to light my way."
- Wurt: "Useless flower, florph."
- Walter: "Will I start glowing if I eat it?"
- Wanda: "I don't have time to stop and smell the flowers."

## Light Bulb Harvesting
- There are three types of light flowers, each yielding a different number of Light Bulbs.
- The Light Flower is a small light source, capable of protecting the player from Charlie's attacks. It ceases to act as a light source once picked.
- The double- and triple-bulb plants yield 2 and 3 bulbs respectively when picked.
- It takes 3 days for a flower with one bulb to regrow, 4–5 days for a two-bulbed flower, and 6 days to spawn a three-bulbed flower.

## Relocation and再生
- Light Flowers cannot be relocated elsewhere with a shovel, and are thus limited to their natural habitat in Caves and Ruins.
- In Don't Starve Together, the Light Flowers are lit when another light source is present. They remain on for 94 to 98 seconds and then enter a dormant phase where they do not produce light. The dormant phase lasts from 114 to 128 seconds, after which they can be turned on again.
- They are also renewable through Regrowth. The Reanimated Skeleton also creates a trail of Light Flowers as it walks, which can be picked for their bulbs. However, these Light Flowers disappear after a few seconds.

## Special Features
- In the Forgotten Knowledge update, Light Flowers in Lunar Grotto release Bulbous Lightbugs upon harvesting. When the Lightbug returns to the plant, it returns to normal. (Any Light Flower can be turned into version that releases Bulbous Lightbug by mutating it with Lunar Experiment).

## Trivia
- Light Flowers were added in the Underground update.

- **Tab**: Nautical
- **Tier**: 1

- Wigfrid: Röwing is in my blööd.
- Wilba: THE ROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE

- Wheeler: If only I had oars for my balloon.
- Choose: Woody

The **Row Boat** is a **Boat** that can be crafted from the **Nautical Tab** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It requires a **Science Machine** to prototype as well as 3 **Boards** and 4 **Vines** to craft. It has 250 durability and can be fitted with boat attachments. If it takes damage, it can be repaired using a **Boat Repair Kit** or the **Sea Yard**.

While moving, it loses durability at a rate of 1 per 5.76 seconds, lasting a total of 3 Days, arguably making it the most efficient boat for traveling.

Occasionally, abandoned Row Boats can be found floating in Medium or Deep **Ocean**, usually equipped with a low durability **Sail** and a **Boat Lantern**.

### Trivia
- The crafting description is a reference to the English song of the same name.
- Wx78's quote is a reference to the 2004 film **I, Robot**.

## Tips
- Saving Maxwell's Dark Sword for stronger mobs or other emergency situations is advised until it's possible to craft more.
- The Dark Sword is one of the strongest melee options in the game in terms of reliable, player-dealt damage. Due to their perks, the Dark Sword proves the most useful when wielded by Wolfgang, Maxwell, and Wigfrid.

## Trivia
- The Dark Sword was added in the "Insanity!" update.
- The design of the Dark Sword appears to be a combination of Nightmare Fuel's visual elements and the shape of a [scimitar], a sword stereotypically used by Ottomans and relative Middle Eastern populace, originating in the 9th century (along with its usage seen in some parts of North India).
- Maxwell’s quote for the Dark Sword appears to be a reference to the famous line from the poem "The Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll.

- Walter: What a pane... heh.
- Wanda: Oh botheration, I thought it was a compass.
- Choose: Wickerbottom

## Downloadable Content
- In the Shipwrecked DLC, the Weather Pain can be used to destroy Obsidian Boulders.
- In the Hamlet DLC, the Weather Pain crafting recipe is unavailable, however, a Blueprint for it can be bought with 100 Oincs from The Tinkerer's Tower. All of its ingredients are available at The Sty Oddities Emporium. The Weather Pain can be used to destroy Suspicious Cracks in the Ancient Pig Ruins.

## Tip
- Due to the somewhat unpredictable behavior of its projectile, the Weather Pain is best used against slow or immobile targets that spawn weaker mobs to defend them, e.g., Big Tentacles, Poison Birchnut Trees, or Spider Queens. This is especially effective against Poisonous Birchnut Trees, which will die in one hit, making the Weather Pain an ideal tool for acquiring Living Logs.
- Against particularly slow Mobs or even immobile ones, the Weather Pain can do more than 100 damage with a single use, surpassing even Blow Darts, making it potentially the best ranged weapon—depending on the target.
- The Weather Pain's projectile destroys trees, which can make it useful for gathering Logs, especially if the trees are planted close together. This will often happen inadvertently in a Poison Birch farm.
- By using a Construction Amulet to make one using 5 feathers, and then using a Deconstruction Staff to get ten feathers back, the Weather Pain can be renewed easily in late game as long as the player doesn't use all its charges before deconstructing it.
- The Weather Pain is handy against certain Boss Mobs such as the Toadstool's Sporecaps and Ancient Fuelweaver's Woven Shadows.

## Trivia
- The name "Weather Pain" is a portmanteau of the words "Weather Vane" and "Pain".
- Weather pains in real life are joint pains induced by atmospheric pressure changes.
- A Shadow Creature that is able to be seen but not yet aggressive towards the players can be aggroed indirectly with the Weather Pain. This can be achieved by using it on some structure or creature which is on the other side of the Shadow Creature. When the projectile is launched, it is able to interact with the Shadow Creature before hitting the other target. This causes it to be aggressive towards the player for a short time.
- Due to the fact that the Moose/Goose only drops up to 5 down feathers, it's impossible to craft this without fighting the former twice or fighting Moslings.
  - However, using a

# Ice Fishing Hole

![Ice Fishing Hole](Ice Fishing Hole.png)

- **Perk**: Can be used to fish in with a [[Sea Fishing Rod]].

## Quotes
"We just want to play!" - Webber

## Gameplay
There is currently a combined total of twenty-five playable **Characters** in **Don't Starve**, its **DLC**s, and **Don't Starve Together** (DST). Each Character has at least one character-specific perk, in addition to various bonuses and penalties to their stats, and usually are different in play style. Each Character is "voiced" by a different instrument, and speaks differently when examining items and objects.

Below are the abilities and requirements to unlock each Character.

### Don't Starve
- **Wilson**: Grows a magnificent beard.
- **Willow**: Immune to Fire damage. Has a sweet Lighter. Lights fires when nervous.

### Abigail
Abigail is Wendy's twin sister, and as Wendy's perk, she can be summoned with Abigail's Flower.

## Trivia
- All playable characters' names start with W apart from Maxwell's. Within the game's code, Maxwell's name is written "Waxwell," in line with the other characters and not to confuse playable Maxwell with NPC Maxwell.

# Tam o' Shanter

## Overview
The Tam o' Shanter is a **Hat** item obtained by killing **MacTusk** of the MacTusk N' Son hunting party. It restores 6.7 **Sanity** per minute while worn. The hat alone is enough to cancel out the sanity drop of heavy **Rain** or **Dusk/Night**, even when playing as **Wolfgang**.

## Trivia
- The Tam o' Shanter was added in **A Winter's Tale** update.
- A Tam o' Shanter, often abbreviated T.O.S. or Tam, is a nineteenth-century Scottish traditional bonnet worn by men.
- Because of MacTusk's death animation, when the Shanter drops, the player will actually see two of them drop from the walrus. One is the item that the player can pick up, while the other is part of the animation and will disappear with MacTusk.

# Security Contract

## Description
The Security Contract is an expensive ink-based item introduced in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It allows players to hire a Royal Guard for up to two and a half days.

## Item Info
- **Description**: The ink is pretty expensive.
- **Ingredient**: Oinc (multiplier 10)
- **Tab**: City Planning
- **Tier**: 16
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: `securitycontract`
- **Sold By**: ![Swinesbury City Hall](32) (Oinc ×10)

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It says I can hire my own town guard."
- Willow: "Now I can hire a guard to help me burn stuff!"
- Wolfgang: "Wolfgang can get piggy friend now."
- ... (other quotes)

## Tips
- As Royal Guards attack enemies with Torches during Dusk and Night, be cautious when having them fight in an area with many flammable objects.
- Royal guards can activate Pressure Plates in Ancient Pig Ruins, possibly activating dart traps. Be cautious when bringing them into ruins.
- Unequipped weapons can be knocked out of their inventory, preventing the guard from switching weapons.
- Befriended Royal Guards will still attack players who commit crimes or pick up their dropped items.
- Befriended Royal Guards will not put out fires and have a sanity aura.

## Bugs
- If the Security Contract has been stolen and the player leaves the City Hall before day, they can come back at the next dusk to steal another Security Contract. This can be repeated infinitely.

## Trivia
- The Security Contract can also be crafted using 1 Tenpiece Oincs or 1 Centapiece Oinc. If using Centapiece Oinc, one will be returned 9 Tenpiece Oincs.

# Red Bird

## Structure Infobox
- **Naughtiness**: 2
- **Name**: Red Bird
- **Diet**: Seeds, Meat (Only on Cage)
- **Health**: 25
- **Drops**: Morsel 50%, Crimson Feather 50%
- **Image**: Redbird Build.png
- **Special Ability**: Drops and eats Seeds
- **Spawn Code**: "robin"
- **Icon**: Redbird.png
- **Spoil**: All DLC: 2 days
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Tool**: Can be Trapped with Bird Trap (Only Bird Trap)

## Quotes by Characters
- **Wilson**: Does that mean spring is coming?
- **Willow**: A redbird. The color of fire, but not a phoenix.
- **Wolfgang**: Is pretty red color bird.
- **Wendy**: Does that mean spring is coming? I hope not.
- **WX-78**: GREETINGS, RED BIRD
- **Wickerbottom**: Cardinalis! Beautiful plumage.
- **Woodie**: Don't get comfortable, birdie.
- **Maxwell**: The redbird comes from the fire lands.
- **Wigfrid**: Red like blood.
- **Wagstaff**: In many ways similar to the ones at home. In many ways quite different.
- **Webber**: Red is my favorite color!
- **Walani**: A song given wing.
- **Warly**: Good afternoon, sir or madam!
- **Woodlegs**: Ye don't talk do ye?
- **Wilba**: 'TIS PRETTY BIRDY!
- **Wormwood**: Red Tweeter
- **Wheeler**: Mind lending me your wings so I can fly away from here?
- **Winona**: She ain't bothering no one.
- **Wortox**: What a fun shade of red.
- **Wurt**: Red bird.
- **Walter**: Wonder how they got here?
- **Wanda**: Some kind of red bird.

## Usage
- Redbirds appear only in Summer and land mostly on Grassland. They fly down from off-screen and peck the ground for a few moments, then fly away. When they take flight, there is a chance that Seeds are left behind, unless it's Winter. Redbirds will also be attracted to Seeds left on the ground. If the player or most other mobs get too close, birds will be frightened away. Birds won't land on Sticky Webbing and will swiftly fly away if they already lands.

## Hunting
- Redbirds can be caught using a Bird Trap. Placing the trap on the ground will eventually catch a bird even without bait. Adding bait such as Seeds or Berries will greatly decrease the time it takes to catch one. They can be Murdered by right-clicking them in inventory to produce a Jet Feather or Morsel, or be cooked on a fire for a Cooked Morsel. Birds in the player's inventory can be dropped on the ground and will flop on the ground belly-up for a short while before flying off. They can also be imprisoned in Bird Cages.

## Tips
- When bait-trapping Birds for their Feathers, players should make sure to do so on Turf in which specific Birds will spawn, so that they get specific Feathers. Redbirds and Snowbirds spawn most commonly on Grass Turf, while Crows spawn on Rocky Turf and all player-made turfs.
- If one can manage to bring a Damaged Bishop from the Ruins, their ranged blasts are an effective tool to hunt birds without expending resources on Bird Traps or Boomerangs.
- If the player doesn't want any Feathers from the Birds, cooking them alive provides a guaranteed Cooked Morsel. Note that this means sacrificing the option of turning the Bird into Small Jerky, since cooked meat cannot be hung on a Drying Rack.

## Trivia
- Before the Naughty and Nice update, the Redbird was called "Red Bird".
- Meat such as Morsels previously attracted Crows. However, Morsels can no longer be used as a bait in traps and will not attract Crows to their location.
- The Redbird is referenced as "Robin" in game files, and uses real-life robin sounds, but the artwork is inspired by a cardinal.
- Woodie strongly dislikes birds. He says they are evil and should be punished.
- Maxwell mentions that he doesn't know how the Crows got to the island and does not recognize the Snowbird. He says that the Redbird comes from "the fire lands", possibly meaning that there are other worlds in the Constant.

## Usage
Rocks are a resource which can be found in limited amounts on the surface but are unlimited in Caves. They are used to craft several Items and Structures, and can also be Refined to Cut Stones.

## Obtaining
Rocks are generally obtained by mining Boulders with a Pickaxe, but they can sometimes be found lying on the ground. They can also be obtained by deconstructing some structures, such as a Fire Pit or a Rundown House, with a Hammer or Deconstruction Staff.

Underground, Rocks can be mined from Stalagmites or dropped by Rock Lobsters. They also fall from the ceiling during Earthquakes. Additionally, they can drop from Relics after smashing them. Slurtles and Snurtles will attempt to eat Rocks, and Slurtles will attack a player holding Rocks if there are no minerals on the ground for them to eat.

Lavae spawned by the Dragonfly can be frozen and killed, resulting in a couple of rocks. Rocks can also be mined from Petrified Evergreens and Stone Fruit.

Moleworms will eat any Rocks lying on the ground. However, their Burrows can be used to renew rocks easily, along with other minerals (excluding Marble and Gems). When dug up using a Shovel, the burrow drops either Rocks, Flint, Nitre or a Gold Nugget. The Moleworm residing there goes off to make a new Burrow.

After unlocking the "Transmute Ore Ⅰ" skill, Wilson is able to craft Rocks from two Flint.

# Miasma

## Object Infobox
- **Name:** Miasma
- **Image:** Miasma.png
- **Perk:** Can be warded away via Fire
- **Spawn From:**
  - ![image](Shadow_Rift_Phase_1)
  - ![image](Shadow_Rift_Phase_2)
  - ![image](Shadow_Rift_Phase_3)
  - ![image](Dreadstone_Outcrop)
- **Damage:** 2 hp/2 sec

## Exclusivity
- **Don't Starve Together**

## Rift Content
- **Shadow Rift**

## Description
**Miasma** is an environmental hazard that spawns around **Shadow Rift** and **Dreadstone Outcrop**. The Miasma range increases with the phase of the rift. Standing within the Miasma will damage the player by 2 hp every 2 seconds, slow them down, and apply an overlay to obscure their vision. 

Applying fire to the Miasma will cause it to dissipate. Such as walking through it with a **Torch** or building a **Campfire**, **Fire Pit**, **Humble Lamb Idol**, **Endothermic Fire**, and **Night Light**. Building a **Scaled Furnace** or casting a dwarf star with **Star Caller's Staff** will not dissipate the Miasma. Additionally, wearing a **Desert Goggles**, **Astroggles**, or **Brightshade Helm** will nullify the slowing effect and lessen the intensity of the overlay, but will not prevent the HP depletion. Wearing **Void Cowl** will prevent the damage but not the slowing effect.

## Tips
- It is recommended to avoid the Miasma entirely, as warding it away is only a temporary measure, and one may opt to simply fight the **Fused Shadeling** that spawn from the Shadow Rift outside of the Miasma instead.

## Trivia
- Miasma was introduced in the **From Beyond#Terrors Below** update.

## Hamlet
Venom Glands are also included in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC where they can be crafted in the Refine Tab by using 3 Poison Dartfrog Legs. They also have a chance to drop from Scorpions and Poison Dartfrogs. Wormwood requires Venom Glands to craft Poison Balm.

   - DLC: Hamlet

5. **Poison Balm**
   - Item1: Venom Gland
   - Item2: Living Log
   - Result: Poison Balm
   - DLC: Hamlet
   - Character: Wormwood

## Tips
- In Shipwrecked, one of the safest and most efficient ways to farm Venom Glands is by luring Sea Hounds or Crocodogs into a group of Stink Rays and then leaving. Most, if not all, of the Stink Rays will be killed, and when the player returns, they will find multiple Venom Glands floating in the ocean. This method removes the chance of being poisoned while fighting venomous creatures, and gives the player multiple glands that can be kept on hand for crafting Anti Venom.
- Due to Maxwell's low health, it is advised to craft an Anti Venom, instead of ingesting a Venom Gland.

## Hunting

### Suspicious Dirt Pile

[[File:Suspicious_Dirt_Pile.png|right|frameless]]

Koalefants can be discovered by investigating Suspicious Dirt Piles that randomly spawn nearby; it will change locations if ignored for a period of time. Once examined, it is replaced by a footprint pointing to another pile approximately two screens away.

### Combat

Using a ranged weapon (e.g. Boomerang, Darts) is the easiest way to initiate a fight, but the animal can also be cornered (see Tips) and struck with a melee weapon to engage. After being angered, the Koalefant will attempt to close distance with the attacker and strikes with the same timing as a Beefalo, although with more damage. A player can safely kite one with an attack pattern of 5-6 swings depending on movement speed.

### Tips

- At night, the Koalefant will be sleeping, and although it will wake up and run away if approached. The time the animal takes to perform this action, gives opportunity for a melee strike.
- As with anything that spawns resources, there is a chance for the loot to fall into water and be lost if dropped too close to seashore.
- Cornering the Koalefant can be difficult with varying land

The Snakeskin Rug is a craftable Turf introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It requires 2 Snakeskins and 1 Cloth to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. During the Monsoon Season, this Turf will not spawn Puddles. However, expanding Puddles can still flood this Turf. Like all other crafted Turfs, Lureplants and their Eye Plants will not spawn on Snakeskin Rug. Like on Jungle Turf, Parrots can spawn on it. Unlike Wooden Flooring, plants can be planted on Snakeskin Rug.

**Trivia:**
- Snakeskin Rug was introduced in the Wilbur Vs. the Volcano update.
- The item's crafting description may be a reference to the movie The Big Lebowski where the protagonist exclaims to a bunch of thugs that one of his most prized possessions is his rug which he claims, "It really ties the room together."

The Cartographer's Desk also has the ability to erase **Blueprint**s, Tackle Adverts, **Sketch**es, Costume Patterns, **Recipe Card**s, and **Lost Scrapbook Page**s turning them into one **Papyrus**, each.

## Tips
* If the Map Scroll is created on the surface, it will not transfer any Caves map data and vice versa.
* The Cartographer's Desk tends to be more useful on servers with larger maps.
* There are **Mods** that make the Cartographer's Desk and Map Scrolls redundant. Therefore, players should be cautious on modded servers to avoid building redundant structures.

## Trivia
* The Cartographer's Desk was added in the **A Little Fixer Upper** update.
* **Cartography** is the science and practice of making maps. A person who makes maps is called a cartographer.

# Spider Warriors

Spider Warriors are dangerous protectors of Spider Dens. They are stronger and slightly larger than Common Spiders, able to leap a considerable distance to attack threats. They are only ever seen when a medium- or large-size Spider Den is attacked, or when a Spider Queen detects a threat nearby.

## Structure Infobox

- **Diet**: [Meats](#)
- **Spawn Code**: "spider_warrior"
- **Health**: 200
- **Damage**: 20
- **Attack Period**: 4–6
- **Attack Range**: 6
- **Walk Speed**: 4
- **Run Speed**: 5
- **Sanity Aura**: -40 (Webber = 0) / -25 (Webber = 0)
- **Special Ability**: [Poison bite](#) (SW)
- **Drops**: Monster Meat (50%), Silk (25%), Spider Gland (25%) / Venom Gland (25%) (SW)
- **Spawn From**: [Spider Den](#)

## Quotes

- **Wolfgang**: This one extra scary.
- **Wilson**: Looks even meaner than usual.
- **Willow**: Maybe I could kill it... with FIRE.
- **Woodie**: They come in yellow now?
- **Maxwell**: It's a specialized form.
- **Wendy**: A warrior of the night!
- **Webber**: Can you teach us to fight good?

## Behavior

When a Spider Den is attacked directly, or when it senses that a nearby Spider was attacked, several Spiders and Spider Warriors come out growling and chase the threat away. After chasing the offending monster, player, or pig too far from their den, Spiders will prefer to return home, though Spider Warriors are willing to chase things farther and to even stand guard outside until the next morning.

Angered Spider Warriors attack by snapping at their targets or even by leaping at them from considerable distances.

## Hunting

Spider Warriors are faster than common Spiders, have twice as much health, and cannot be stunned. It usually takes a half-dozen or more hits to kill one, and it takes fast dodges and rapid strikes to kill them without being wounded. Fighting on a Road or carrying a Walking Cane is recommended.

## Usage & Farming

Although Spiders are a dangerous foe early on and a constant nuisance later on, a properly tended-to Spider Den can become a useful source of Spider Glands, Monster Meat, and Silk. Spider Glands are an important healing ingredient, used in Healing Salves, Telltale Hearts, and Wendy's Revenant Restorative. Monster Meat, used sparingly, can be a meaty ingredient in Crock Pot recipes. Silk is a vitally important resource for surviving the cold Winter, but it's also necessary for fishing, beekeeping, birdkeeping, and (by extension) controlled agriculture. All of these things make them a prime candidate for farming, which can be done fairly easily.

A word of caution to the unwary: A den mustn't be left unattended for too long, or it might grow legs and walk off. A mature, overgrowing Spider Den can turn into a Spider Queen, who walks away leaving the old den behind, and plant itself in a new location as a fresh den. The queen is very dangerous, and she can overrun an entire base. Mature Spider Dens should be knocked down and replanted to avoid the risk of ever seeing a queen.

## Trivia

- Spider Warriors were added in the update, Long Live the Queen.
- Spiders are the mobs with the greatest variation in the game. They have a total of 10 varieties, including the Spider Queen, the venomous Spider Warrior from Shipwrecked, and the Shattered Spider, Nurse Spider, and Sea Strider from Don't Starve Together.
- All varieties of spiders in-game have six legs instead of eight, unlike real spiders.

## Trivia
- The Rabbit Earmuffs were added in the Doorway to Adventure update.
- While the Earmuffs do not prevent the Bearger's yawn from putting the player to sleep in Don't Starve Together, they will prevent the Queen Womant from stunning the player with her tuba attack.

## Description
Reeds are harvestable [Plants] typically found in [Marsh] [Biomes]. They can be harvested to receive 1 [Cut Reeds]. Once cut, they will need 3 [days] to regrow, but will not regrow during [Winter].

Reeds cannot be dug up and relocated like [Grass Tufts] or [Saplings]. They are flammable and will leave behind 1 [Ashes] when burned. They also cannot be uprooted by bosses, such as the [Bearger].

Being found in one of the most hostile biomes in the game, harvesting Reeds is much more dangerous than most other materials, due to the [Tentacles], [Mosquitoes], [Spiders], and [Merms] that dwell there.

There is a [Set Piece] known as "Reed Trap", which is a thick patch of Reeds where a dense presence of [Tentacles] can also be found.

## Trivia
- According to [Wickerbottom], the reeds belong to the rush family Juncaceae, even though species in the family are not used to produce paper. The family Juncaceae is often confused with the sedge family Cyperaceae, which contains "Cyperus papyrus" (also known as Paper Reed), a plant the Ancient Egyptians used to create paper.
  - The appearance of the Reed in-game, due to its telltale flower, suggests that the plant belongs to the cattail/reedmace family Typhaceae. This family includes the genus "Typha", which is also used to produce paper.

## Scrapbook Info
Can be placed on dirt ground to change the type of ground.

Slimy Turf is one of the Turf items, acquired by digging Slimy tiles with a Pitchfork. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile, or it can be used as fuel. Slimy Turf can be crafted and prototyped with 1 Cut Grass and 1 Foliage at Terra Firma Tamper in the Decorations Filter.

Slimy Turf is only found in Caves. It is one of the two Turfs that connect or surround a Sunken Forest. Sometimes, a player may find Saplings in an area covered with Slimy Turf.

Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Spiky Bushes, Pine Cones, Birchnuts, and Lureplants can be placed normally on Slimy Turf, and Eyeplants will spawn normally. Crows are the only Birds that will land on Slimy Turf.

The Crab King is a Boss Mob exclusive to 'Don't Starve Together', introduced in 'Return of Them'. It can be found in the Swell Ocean inside a circle of Sea Stacks in its inert form. Its position can be detected by the Astral Detector if the Inactive Celestial Tribute has not yet dropped. To initiate the boss fight, players must socket 9 Gems to transform the Crab King into its aggressive form. This action will destroy all nearby Sea Stacks. If the player leaves combat, the Crab King will return to its inert state, dropping all socketed gems. It will also despawn all Crab Guards, Crab Knights, Cannon Towers, Imposing Claws, Ice Floes, while respawning new Sea Stacks around itself.

Upon death, the Crab King drops all socketed gems, 6 pieces of Meats, 2-4 Message in Bottles, 8 Crab King Bumper Kits, 2-4 Barnacles, 1-3 Baritone Shell Bells, 2-4 Alto Shell Bells, 3-5 Soprano Shell Bells, and a Blueprint for the Strident Trident. If the Pearl's Pearl was socketed, a Cracked Pearl is dropped instead of the Pearl's Pearl, and an Inactive Celestial Tribute in the form of an Underwater Salvageable appears as well.

The Crab King reappears 20 days after being killed.

Crab King has Explosive Resistance and cannot be put to sleep. Its resistance to freezing is 3 and increases with the number of Blue Gems socketed.

## Fight
After 9 gems are socked, the Crab King turns aggressive and summons 5 Imposing Claws and 4 Cannon Towers to start the fight. When Crab King's Health drops below 10800, it will try to heal itself for every 1500 health lost or whenever all claws are killed, after a delay of 12 seconds. It will first despawn all Imposing Claws and generate a large number of Waves to push all Float Platforms away. At the same time, it summons a ring of geysers, indicated by bubbles, in a circle of 8 units around itself, in all directions except south. After 8 seconds, the geysers will erupt once per second until there are no Float Platforms within

# Seashell Suit

**Exclusivity:** Shipwrecked

## Item Infobox

- **Name:** Seashell Suit
- **Ingredients:**
  - Seashell: 10x
  - Seaweed: 2x
  - Rope: 1x
- **Tab:** Fight
- **Tier:** 1
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Perk:** Protects the player from getting poisoned by physical contact.
- **Durability:** 750 hp
- **Dropped By:** Slotmachine, X Marks The Spot
- **Spawn Code:** armorseashell
- **Description:** Pretty poison prevention.
- **Protection:** 75%

The **Seashell Suit** is an **Armor** **Item** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC, made with 10 **Seashell**s, two **Seaweed**, and one **Rope**. It requires a **Science Machine** to prototype, will absorb 75% of damage taken, and prevent the player from getting **Poison**ed by physical attacks.

## Protection Details

The Seashell Suit protects against Poison from **Poison Snake**s, **Poison Mosquito**es, **Spider Warrior**s and **Crocodog#Yellow Crocodog|Yellow Crocodogs**.

Note that this item does **not** protect against clouds of poison gas, such as those from **Stink Ray**s and **Poisonous Hole**s.

## Tips

- It can be especially helpful to wear the Seashell Suit when chopping **Jungle Tree**s as **Poison Snake**s may appear.
- Keeping a Seashell Suit in the inventory during **Monsoon Season** can be really handy, since it is a cheap way to protect the character from **Poison Mosquito**es. It is also more efficient than carrying an **Anti Venom** and armor at the same time, saving one inventory slot.
- It is recommended to carry a Seashell Suit or **Horned Helmet** when gambling at the **Slot Machine**, since there is a chance to get **Poison Snake**s or **Poison Mosquito**es after a spin.
