- Walter: "I should eat these fast."
- Wanda: "That turned out better than I expected."

## Usage

- **Cooking**: Juicy Berries can be cooked to make Roasted Juicy Berries.
- **Pig**: Juicy Berries can be used to create Manure.
- **Crock Pot**: Juicy Berries can be used in various Crock Pot recipes to make Waffles and Trail Mix.

## Tips

- Juicy Berries spoil thrice as fast as usual Berries, making them a good source of fertilizer in the form of Rot.
- Juicy Berry farms can be managed by leaving the berries on the bush and harvesting them frugally, as they do not spoil while on the bush.
- Eating Roasted Juicy Berries is slightly more efficient than making them into meatballs, but both methods

## Skins
- Woven - Elegant Gatekeepers' Club: Introduced during the official The Forge event in 2018.
- Loyal Nouveau Club: Awarded for watching 6 hours of Don't Starve Together on Twitch from April 12, 2023 to May 11, 2023.

## Tips
- Shadow Tentacles are stationary and have a limited attack range. They are not very useful against fast-moving enemies but provide a good advantage against slow or stationary ones.
- The Thulecite Club and Dark Sword are often compared. While the Dark Sword does more direct damage, the total damage from the Club and the Shadow Tentacles can potentially be higher. The Thulecite Club also lasts longer and drains more Sanity than the sword if the player is standing close to them.
- A way to gain sanity in DST is to combine a Thulecite Club with a Bee Queen Crown, because the Crown will convert the Sanity loss of the Shadow Tentacles into +20 sanity per minute and also provides defense (70%) at the same time.

## Trivia
- The Thulecite Club was added in the "The Stuff of Nightmares" update.
- The Thulecite Club is very similar to an Aztec weapon called the macuahuitl, which has been reported to cut off a horse's head in a single blow due to the sharpness of its obsidian blades.
- In older versions of Don't Starve, Shadow Tentacles always spawned when attacking.
- Webber's quote is a reference to Queen's song, "We Will Rock You."

# Beefalo Wool

## Overview
Beefalo Wool is an **Item** obtained by either killing a **Beefalo** or a **Baby Beefalo**, or by shaving a **sleeping** Beefalo with a **Razor** (by clicking them with a Razor held by the mouse cursor). It is used to make a **Saddle**, **Winter Hat**, **Beefalo Hat**, **Puffy Vest**, and **Carpeted Flooring**.

## Fuel Source
Beefalo Wool also makes an excellent **Fuel** source for **Campfires** and **Fire Pits**. A small herd of Beefalo can easily keep a Fire Pit lit for days, and as the wool grows back, this is a good short term solution.

## Obtaining in Reign of Giants DLC
In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, there are alternative methods of obtaining Beefalo Wool; harvesting a **Tumbleweed**, or befriending a **Catcoon**, as friendly Catcoons may give Beefalo Wool as a gift.

## Exclusivity
Don't Starve Together

## Rift Content
Shadow

## Scrapbook Info
Bind a Beefalo to the bell. A bound Beefalo will follow the holder, even into the caves and offline. You can also use this bell to revive a bound Beefalo.

The **Beefalo Gloom Bell** is a craftable **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**. It can only be crafted at a **Shadowcraft Plinth**, requiring 1 **Possessed Shadow Atrium**, 5 **Pure Horror**, 4 **Dreadstone**, and 2 **Dark Tatters**.

The Beefalo Gloom Bell is functionally the same as a **Beefalo Bell**, although it uses the word "bind" rather than "bond".

When a **Beefalo** bound by a **Beefalo Gloom Bell** dies, its corpse sticks around. The **Beefalo Gloom Bell** can then be used on it to bring the Beefalo back to life. Doing this makes the **Beefalo Gloom Bell** go into a 15-day cooldown, removes 50% of the player's **maximum health**, and the player loses 100 **Sanity**. A player's removed maximum health can be restored by **Booster Shots**.

If the bound Beefalo dies while the Bell is on cooldown, its corpse disappears immediately. While the **Beefalo Gloom Bell** is on cooldown, it cannot be deconstructed with **Deconstruction Staff**.

If a player's bound Beefalo is a corpse on the ground and that player leaves the server or goes from caves to surface (or vice versa), the corpse disappears and can no longer be revived.

While bound with a **Beefalo Gloom Bell**, the Beefalo's dropped **Manure** disappears after 5 seconds.

## Tips
- A player may want to have two Beefalo Gloom Bells crafted, so that when one is on cooldown, they can bind their Beefalo with the other one and ensure it can be revived.
- The Beefalo Gloom Bell and **Beefalo Bell** can be eaten by **Lureplant** and **Great Depths Worm** and will be gone forever. The Bells can also be stolen by **Powder Monkey**, but they can be retrieved back by digging the **Pirate Stash**.

# Captain's Tricorn

The **Captain's Tricorn** is a **Hat** [Item](#) exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **The Curse of Moon Quay** update. It is obtained by killing a **Prime Mate** during a **Pirate raid** and is required to craft **Polly Roger's Hat**.

When worn by the player, it reduces the **durability** loss rate of the **Boat** the player is on by half and reduces collision damage by half. This includes the persistent durability loss of **Grass Rafts**. Notably, the **Captain's Tricorn** does not reduce durability loss from other sources, such as **Crab King**s Cannon Towers.

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: I think it makes me look very dashing and captain-like.
- **Willow**: I took that dumb monkey's hat.
- **Wolfgang**: Wolfgang will be best first mate!
- **Wendy**: A captain must go down with her ship.
- **WX-78**: I AM YOUR CAPTAIN NOW
- **Wickerbottom**: Suitable headwear for one who spends time at sea.
- **Woodie**: If a monkey can do it, so can I, eh?
- **Maxwell**: I'm sure it's full of fleas.
- **Wigfrid**: The helm of one who knows the sea.
- **Webber**: Wearing a fancy hat definitely makes you better at sailing.
- **Warly**: Je suis le capitaine!
- **Wormwood**: Wear on Floaty, look nice
- **Winona**: Dress for the job you want.
- **Wortox**: I hope this tricorn fits around my horns.
- **Wurt**: Me captain now!
- **Walter**: Listen up everybody, I'm the captain!
- **Wanda**: If I must be at sea, I might as well look the part.

## Trivia

- The Captain's Tricorn can be considered the Don't Starve Together equivalent to the **Captain Hat** in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** as both items serve to reduce the durability loss of boats. However, it has a far more similar design to the **Pirate Hat**.

## Scrapbook Info
Knocks items out of targets inventory.

The **Cutless** is a Melee weapon exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **The Curse of Moon Quay** update. It is used by aggressive **Powder Monkeys** who will drop the item on their death. The Cutless deals a small amount of damage equal to that of an axe. When hitting a creature that has an inventory, including another player, it will knock the leftmost item from it.

The Cutless can also be used as a source of Fuel.

## Trivia
- The item's name is a play on the word "cutlass" with "lass" being replaced with "less". This is likely referring to the weapon's low damage.

# Thulecite Suit

## Overview
The Thulecite Suit is a craftable Item found in the Ancient Tab. It requires 4 Nightmare Fuel, 6 Thulecite, and an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. It also has a 33% chance to be found inside a Large Ornate Chest.

## Details
- **Durability**: 1800 HP
- **Sanity Drain**: +3.3/min
- **Perk**: Absorbs 90% of physical damage. Restores sanity over time.
- **Dropped By**: Large Ornate Chest (Slotmachine, Chest of the Depths, X Marks The Spot, Shipwrecked icon)
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "armorruins"
- **Description**: Flashy AND protective.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It's oddly light."
- Willow: "Not sure I want to wear this."
- Wolfgang: "Protect me? I don't need it!"
- Wendy: "A reprieve from death."
- WX78: "QUICK PUT IT ON ME"
- Wickerbottom: "A hardy Thulecite armor."
- Woodie: "That'll stop the hurt."
- Maxwell: "Thulecite meshes so well with nightmare fuel."
- Wagstaff: "That wonderful dark fuel provides an extra barrier to this armor."
- Wigfrid: "Armor fit for Odin himself!"
- Webber: "Nice and lightweight."
- Walani: "It's so fancy!"
- Warly: "Ancient armor."
- Woodlegs: "Feels like I be wearin' treasure."
- Wilba: "WILBA CLOAK'D IN GHOSTLY STUFFS"
- Wormwood: "Heavy clothes"
- Wheeler: "Ready for whatever adventures come my way."
- Winona: "Not a bad piece of work."
- Wortox: "This thulecite sure is a delight!"
- Wurt: "Strong!"
- Walter: "Woah! It's not even heavy!"
- Wanda: "I'm all for anything that'll keep me safe."

## Crafting and Availability
In the Reign of Giants DLC, players have a 0.02% chance of finding Green Gems inside Tumbleweeds, thus making Thulecite Suits renewable. In the Shipwrecked DLC, Thulecite Suit, along with Thulecite Crown and Thulecite Club, can be obtained from the Slot Machine or Chest of the Depths as a possible reward, making Thulecite equipment also renewable in Shipwrecked.

## Tips
- While providing slightly less protection compared to the Night Armor and Marble Suit, the Thulecite has more Durability and no drawbacks, making it more favorable to craft.
- Unlike Dress items, wearing the Thulecite Suit to regain Sanity will not decrease its durability, allowing infinite Sanity regeneration, as long as players don't get hit enough for it to break.
- It is possible to use a Construction Amulet to craft 5 Thulecite Suits for 15 Thulecite, then use a Deconstruction Staff on those 5 Thulecite Suits to get 30 Thulecite back for a profit of 13 Thulecite (the Amulet costs 2 Thulecite). Doing this multiple times makes it possible to collect big amounts of otherwise non-renewable Thulecite from a few Green Gems.
- In all DLCs, You can World Hop in a separate DLC from Reign of Giants, to reset the Ruins, technically making Thulecite renewable.

## Trivia
- The Thulecite Suit was added in "A Moderately Friendly Update".
- Like all other chest slot armors, this suit also makes a slight noise while the player is moving with it equipped.

# Piggyback

<center>
![Piggyback Dropped](Piggyback%20Dropped.png)
</center>

## Description
The Piggyback is a type of backpack that requires 4 Pig Skins, 6 Silk, and 2 Ropes to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. It is a larger backpack with 12 Inventory slots but reduces walking speed by 20% while equipped. It has 4 more slots than a regular backpack but 2 less than the Krampus Sack. It cannot be placed in the inventory or in Chests. Unlike the regular backpack, it is fireproof.

## Details
- **Scrapbook Description:** A large 12 slots container that also slows the wearer by 20% when worn.
- **Tier:** 2
- **Filter:** Clothing Filter, Storage Solutions Filter
- **Ingredients:**
  - Pig Skin: 4
  - Silk: 6
  - Rope: 2
- **Perk:** +12 Inventory slots. Slows movement speed by 20%. Waterproofs items.
- **Spawn Code:** "piggyback"
- **Name:** Piggyback
- **Stack:** Does not stack

## Quotes
- Wilson: This little piggy's gone... "home".
- Willow: I made a backpack out of butts!
- Wolfgang: Smelly bag!
- Wendy: They are more useful in death.
- WX78: UPGRADED STORAGE MODULE V2.0
- Wickerbottom: A face only necessity could love.
- Woodie: I used all parts of the pig.
- Maxwell: Oh, that's just demeaning.
- Wagstaff: An epiphany in transporting technology.
- Wigfrid: The pig died with hönör, then gave tö me this pack.
- Webber: It holds so much stuff!
- Walani: Was it worth it?
- Warly: Cochon bag!
- Woodlegs: From th'flesh o'th'boar.
- Wilba: 'TIS SUCH AS THING WILBA MADE ON
- Wormwood: Carries stuff
- Wheeler: Storage space! Just what I always wanted!
- Winona: Makes everything smell like pig.
- Wortox: So I keep my things within this little bag made of pig skin.
- Wurt: Made bag from nasty pigskin.
- Walter: This is giving me inspiration for a new campfire story...
- Wanda: Do I really want to lug this thing around?

## Skins
- **Woven - Elegant Piggy Backpack:** Introduced during the Year of the Carrat event in 2020 in the Survivalist's Belongings Chest.
- **Woven - Elegant Elephant Pack:** Introduced with the Wolfgang Refresh in December 2021 through the Musclebound Chest.

## Tips
- This is a good replacement for the backpack until you get the Krampus Sack.
- Using a Walking Cane, roads, and other means of speed increase can mitigate or negate the speed penalty.
- In the Hamlet DLC, the speed penalty can be mitigated with the Stalking Stick.
- The Piggyback does not give the player any rain resistance, and using it in conjunction with an Umbrella will not protect the rest of the player's items from wetness.
- In Don't Starve Together, Wolfgang, when in Mighty form, ignores the item's speed penalty, making Piggyback a direct upgrade from the Backpack to him.
- In Don't Starve Together, Woodie also doesn't suffer from the Piggyback's speed penalty, but only when he is transformed in one of his Wereforms. This makes the Piggyback useful to equip for extra storage when going out to gather lots of items using the Wereforms such as logs and loot from Lunar Island.

## Trivia
- The Piggyback was added in the Doorway to Adventure update.
- The Piggyback's name is a pun, on both the fact it is a backpack made from a pig's skin and on the action of giving a piggyback.

# Magiluminescence

## Overview
Magiluminescence is a craftable item found in the Ancient Tab. It requires 2 Thulecite, 3 Nightmare Fuel, and 1 Yellow Gem, and at least a broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. It can also drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when damaged. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Magiluminescence cannot be prototyped and can only be crafted near another Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

## Properties
- **Light Emission**: Provides light like a torch, preventing attacks from Charlie.
- **Speed Boost**: Grants a 20% bonus to movement speed.
- **Sanity Boost**: Provides the character with a passive +2 sanity per minute.
- **Durability**: Lasts for 8 minutes (1 day) and can be refueled with Nightmare Fuel, increasing its durability by 37.5% (3 minutes) per 1 Nightmare Fuel.

## Crafting Ingredients
- **Thulecite**: 2x
- **Nightmare Fuel**: 3x
- **Yellow Gem**: 1x

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Warm to the touch."
- Willow: "It seems to absorb the darkness around it."
- Wolfgang: "Is glowing yellow."
- Wendy: "A brief light in my dark life."
- WX-78: "INCANDESCENCE AT 5200000000000000Hz"
- Wickerbottom: "This amulet is glowing at the mid 530 nanometer wavelength."
- Woodie: "I could cut wood at night with this."
- Maxwell: "This will make me stand out."
- Wagstaff: "A dark fuel infused discharger of kinetic and light energy."
- Wigfrid: "A star, captured within an amulet."
- Webber: "Nice and glowy."
- Walani: "I absolutely glow when I wear it!"
- Warly: "Puts some pep in my step!"
- Woodlegs: "I be a walkin' lighthouse!"
- Wilba: 'TIS SHINIES
- Wormwood: "Can go zoomy now!"
- Wheeler: "Puts a light on my chest and a spring in my step."
- Winona: "Useful little tool."
- Wortox: "I'll give my brain a slight refrain."
- Wurt: "Feel warm..."
- Walter: "With this on, I'm invincible! Right?"
- Wanda: "Just the boost I needed."

## Tips
- The speed bonus stacks with the Walking Cane or The Lazy Explorer, for a total increase of 45% movement speed (88.5% on Roads). This can be further stacked with overloaded WX-78's.
- Unlike Lanterns, Miner Hats, etc., Magiluminescences are destroyed when durability reaches 0%, so extra care is needed to prevent their loss.
- If players plan on keeping a Magiluminescence equipped at all times for the speed boost, it will cost them roughly 2.7 Nightmare Fuel per day.

## Trivia
- When placed on the ground, the Magiluminescence used to glow and not lose any durability. As of the A Moderately Friendly Update, they will no longer glow when dropped on the ground.
- The Magiluminescence shares the same in-game model with the Nightmare Amulet, but its gem is yellow instead of purple.
- This is the only light-emitting item that can be equipped in the chest slot.
- Before the Release the Quacken update for Shipwrecked, Magiluminescence could not be refueled with Nightmare Fuel. This change was applied to the other game versions too.
- Wickerbottom states the amulet glows at "mid 530 nanometer wavelength." However, a wavelength of ~535 nm is a green light, not yellow, mid 530 means that the brightness peaks at around 530, and other wavelengths of light, mostly red, are also mixed in, resulting in yellow.

- In a Hamlet-compatible Reign of Giants or Shipwrecked world, the player can utilize the Brain of Thought to build Town Houses, My City Hall, and most of the Pig Shops without ever entering Hamlet world through the Skyworthy.
- Because you usually need to be near an Ancient Pseudoscience station to craft items in the Ancient Tab, this can be used as an alternative.

## Trivia
- The name may be a pun on the common saying "I lost my train of thought."

## Prototype Tips

* The Bush Hat is an effective method for avoiding incoming Hound attacks, as the Hounds will simply pass by a player hidden in the hat. The player will unhide whenever exclaiming "Did you hear that?" but if the player quickly hides again before the Hounds arrive, the Hounds won't notice. This trick can be especially useful when around Beefalo, since using the bush hat will instantly cause the hounds to attack any nearby mobs.
* Camping out in Spider-infested territories is dangerous (unless playing as Webber), especially during long winter nights. Utilizing the Bush Hat will spare the wearer from dealing with spiders during the night.
* The Bush Hat is also useful in Caves/Ruins situations to hide during aggressive stages of the Nightmare Cycle. Note that a light source can still be equipped in the hand slot.
* If the player doesn't have a ranged weapon or can't corner a Koalefant they want to kill, they can hide in a Bush Hat when the closest distance is reached. Then the Koalefant may wander over, giving the player a chance to hit it before it can flee.
* Using the Bush Hat with Willow's Lighter works well if one does not have time to set up a camp or it's too dangerous, as her Lighter will stay active to protect her from Charlie indefinitely (excludes Don't Starve Together), and the Bush Hat will prevent her from being spotted by hostile mobs, provided she hasn't already been seen.

## Trivia

* The Bush Hat is the only item equipped in the head slot that does not have a durability mechanic, except for the Straw Hat in the base game. However, in the base game, a Straw Hat has no benefit when worn, making the Bush Hat the only head slot item that has no durability despite having a practical use.
* This item was added in the Insanity! update.
* Before the Caves update, the player would automatically hide in the Bush Hat upon standing still.
* In the Shipwrecked DLC, it's impossible to craft a Bush Hat, as there are only the leafy variant of Berry Bushes. This can be circumvented by linking the Shipwrecked world to a base game, Reign of Giants, or Hamlet save.
* In Don't Starve Together, it's possible for a world containing only Juicy Berry Bushes to generate, thus making the Bush Hat impossible to craft.

## Bugs

* Wearing a Backpack or Piggyback will prevent the Player from hiding. (Mobile only)

### Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, players have a 0.02% chance of finding Orange Gems inside Tumbleweeds, thus making Lazy Foragers renewable. As of the mega update, orange gems have become renewable with the Seed of Ruin allowing the player to regenerate the ruins to acquire more orange gems.

### Tips
- The Lazy Forager can be used to pick up rare items from Cave Holes. New treasures spawn in the Cave Holes every time the Ruins are reset.
- The Lazy Forager can be used to collect Salt Crystals that drop out of pickup range near mined Salt Formations. This can make it less tedious to maneuver around the mined Salt Formations each time the player wants to collect the Salt Crystals.
  - Similarly, any items floating in the ocean out of the players reach can be retrieved with The Lazy Forager.
- During the Pig King Wrestling Match in DST, the Lazy Forager will automatically pick up any Gold Nuggets, whether dropped by the Pig King or by the player himself.
- Despite being refuellable, The Lazy Forager will still break at 0%, so care must be taken.
- The Lazy Forager will not count full stacks as one item when reducing durability - instead, it will pull one piece out of the stack at a time. It will also pick up any Traps, Tooth Traps, or Bee Mines nearby.
- The Lazy Forager can be used to aid in clearing out landspace to expand the player's base. It will automatically pick up any Turfs, Logs, Saplings, Rocks and other resources that are dropped when clearing out various naturally

# Codex Umbra

The Codex Umbra is a character-exclusive item that Maxwell starts the game with. When used, it sacrifices 15 health and 55 of maximum sanity to spawn a Shadow Puppet clone of Maxwell. It has infinite durability and requires 2 Nightmare Fuel to be used. For each puppet active, Maxwell's maximum sanity is reduced, similar to how Meat Effigies reduce maximum health. A maximum of 3 puppets can be active at one time and each one will disappear 2.5 days after it was summoned. If a Shadow Puppet is killed or despawns, Maxwell will get the used max sanity back.

## Origin

The Codex Umbra was discovered by William Carter in 1904, details are unknown. William was intrigued by the "terrifying" possibilities it offered. Months later, he established himself in San Francisco and began going by the name of Maxwell. Maxwell updated his act to incorporate dark manifestations that he taught himself to summon from the Codex Umbra. He found great success in this new act and eventually hired an assistant, Charlie. During their last performance, Maxwell's act went normally until he attempted to pull "shadows incarnate" from the Codex and was instead pulled into the book by giant shadow hands. Soon, the entire act ends in disaster as both Maxwell and Charlie are violently dragged into a parallel dimension.

The Codex Umbra reappeared, still in Maxwell's possession, after he was dethroned and became a survivor. After reuniting with Wilson, Maxwell found the scientist's blueprints for an invention and offered to help construct it with assistance from the Codex Umbra. This made it possible for Maxwell and Wilson to build a portal that allowed other survivors to join forces with them.

## Trivia

- Codex Umbra is Latin for "shadow manuscript".
- It's possible for the Codex Umbra to be set alight and burn into ashes. The book will re-appear in Maxwell's inventory upon re-loading the world.
- If using the Codex Umbra reduces Maxwell's health to zero, the Morgue will list the cause of death as "Shenanigans".
- Like Abigail's Flower, the Codex Umbra floats when placed on the ground, but only if the corresponding Maxwell is nearby. If he moves out of range, the book will close and fall to the ground.

## Bugs

- Despite being a starting character specific item, the Codex Umbra can be stolen by mobs like Krampus or Eyeplants.
- Using a Sinkhole to enter the Caves or Ruins without the Codex Umbra can sometimes cause it to duplicate in the player's inventory.
- In the Shipwrecked DLC, using a Volcano to climb onto it without the Codex Umbra can sometimes cause it to duplicate in the player's inventory.

# Pigs

**Pigs** are neutral mobs that live in **Pig Houses**, which spawn in a variety of **Biomes** and **Set Pieces**. While normally harmless, they will be hostile toward **Webber**, **Wortox**, and **Wurt**. They also attack **Monster** mobs (e.g. **Spider**s, **Tentacle**s, **Treeguards**) on sight. Pigs drop a **Meat** or a **Pig Skin** upon death. They will respawn from their houses in 4 **Day-Night Cycle** days (32 minutes).

## Behavior
**Pigs** will return home at dusk and night, or frantically run around if homeless. Providing a light source, such as a **Torch** or a **Campfire**, will calm them and they will **Sleep** beside the light source throughout the night. In **Winter**, Pigs will not sleep, but will instead stay awake around the fire with normal dusk dialogue, while displaying a scared animation.

Feeding a Pig **Meats**, **Eggs**, or **Inedibles** (e.g. **Slurper Pelt**, Pig Skin, **Bunny Puff**) will cause it to follow the player for up to 2.5 days. The length of time that a Pig will remain loyal is based on the hunger value of the given food. For example, feeding a fresh Morsel will cause the Pig to follow for 240 seconds (12.5 hunger value × 19.2 seconds). If a Pig eats 4 pieces of meat-based Monster Food (**Monster Meat**, **Cooked Monster Meat**, **Monster Jerky**, **Monster Lasagna**, **Monster Tartare**), or is outdoors during a **Full Moon**, it will turn into a **Werepig**.

## Hunting
Attacking a Pig will aggravate it and up to 5 Pigs within 30m. Aggressive Pigs **Kite**; they punch once then withdraw, before approaching the target to punch again.

Pigs can be damaged by Tooth Traps set by the player, but this will not make them hostile.

As Pigs are harder to deal with, will be aggravated by their fellow Pigs being attacked, and are not fully guaranteed to drop their loot when killed, it is quite inadvisable to hunt Pigs in their normal form; killing Pigs in their Werepig form is more predictable, won't aggravate normal Pigs, and guarantees richer drops, therefore is more advisable.

## Usage
Friendly Pigs have a **Sanity** aura of +25/min; however, they naturally tend to keep their distance from others unless they are chopping **Tree**s, sleeping, or cornered.

When their loyalty time is less than 60 seconds, Pigs may animate as hungry, by which they pout and rub their bellies. If the time is more than 360 seconds, they may animate as happy. If loyalty time runs out or the player dies, they will return to their respective homes (or wander around if homeless). **Befriended Pigs** can be commanded to fight; however, they will not attack **Shadow Creatures**. They can help chop trees. When the player hits any tree with an **Axe** once, they will join in chopping until the player and the Pigs are apart. If the Pigs spawn a **Treeguard**, it will attack them. Pigs do not work during dusk or night, nor in the dark.

They can wear **headgear** items; clicking on a Pig with a headgear selected will equip it on the Pig. They receive a head armor's damage reduction effects; however, durability will still be drained if the Pig takes damage. By wearing the **Miner Hat**, a Pig will provide light and not panic during dusk or in a **Cave**, while also preventing nearby Pigs from panicking.

## Quotes
- When too close: "YOU BACK OFF!", "STAY AWAY!", "THAT MY SPACE.", "TOO CLOSE!"
- Battlecries: "I KILL NOW!", "RAAAWR!", "YOU GO SMASH!"
- When finding food: "YUM!", "I EAT FOOD!", "ME HUNGRY!", "TIME FOR FOOD!"
- When eating food: "YUM!", "NOM NOM NOM"
- Allied: "I LOVE FRIEND.", "I FOLLOW!", "YOU IS GOOD.", "YOU FRIEND."

## Tips
- The Sanity auras of friendly Pigs stack. Given their relative ease to befriend, and their tendency to sleep near a fire at night, befriending Pigs is a quick way to restore large

## Description

Mants are Mobs exclusive to the Hamlet DLC. They spawn from Antcomb Homes as Larvae, inside Mant Hills. Mants can mostly be found inside the Mant Hill, or wandering around it.

They are hostile Mobs, and will attack the player if they are too close. However, they will first warn the player to leave by glaring at them. Wearing a full set of Mant Armor as a disguise (i.e. Mant Suit and Mant Mask) will make them neutral to the player as long as the armor is worn. Their language is normally indecipherable but it can be understood with the Pherostone in the player's inventory. However, owning one without the Mant disguise won't prevent them from being aggressive.

Mants can be befriended by using the Pherostone to determine which food they eat, and then feeding the corresponding meat, seeds, plants, or wood. Befriended Mants will assist the player in chopping down trees and attacking mobs.

Upon death, they drop either one Monster Meat or one Chitin. When examined by a character, the displayed name will be “Drone”, followed by a six-digit number.

Mants will consume any food left on the ground. If the player is holding a Magnifying Glass, nearby Mants will panic. During the Aporkalypse, all Mants will transform into aggressive Warrior Mants wearing glowing warpaint.

Mants take two Sleep Darts to be put to sleep, and two hits from an Ice Staff to be frozen.

A **Bunny Puff** can be obtained by killing a **Bunnyman** or by deconstructing a **Rabbit Hutch** underground with a **Hammer** or **Deconstruction Staff**. Bunny Puffs are not dropped by **Rabbits**.

Bunny Puffs are used to create the **Fur Roll** and the **Rabbit Hutch**. They can also be traded to the **Pig King** for two **Gold Nuggets** each and fed to **Pigs** to befriend them. Bunny Puffs are classified as **Horrible** meat, which means Pigs, **Hounds**, and **Spiders** have no complaints about eating left behind Bunny Puffs on the ground.

## Skins

- **Woven - Elegant Rod of Discord**: Introduced in the "An Eye for An Eye" update in 2021, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's "Terraria".

## Tips

- Equip a Construction Amulet when crafting The Lazy Explorer to save on the rare Orange Gems.
- Do not have the staff equipped while planting or performing other activities that involve right-clicking.
- Stack the speed bonus with Magiluminescence for a total increase of 45% movement speed.

## Trivia

- Wendy's quote ("Each time I use it I die and am reborn.") relates to the theory about teleportation that, if a human being were to teleport, their body's atoms would be deconstructed and replaced elsewhere, essentially killing and then recreating the person in question.
- The Lazy Explorer's damage used to be 10 and was then changed to match the Walking Cane at 17 damage.

## Bugs

- Teleporting across gaps may cause the player to land off the map.
- Occasionally, if the player teleports too quickly, the sound effect of swinging will be played, but the rod will not swing, and the player will also not teleport.

## Recipe
Fancy Spiralled Tubers are [Vegetable] [Food] [Items] exclusive to [Don't Starve Together]. They are cooked in the [Crock Pot] by combining 1 [Potato], [Twigs] and two fillers. It takes 15 seconds to cook. Adding [Meats] will result in [Kabobs]. Adding more than 1 [Durian] will result in [Monster Lasagna]. Adding more than 2 twigs will result in [Wet Goop].

### Ingredients
- 1x Potatoes
- 1x Twigs
- 2x Filler
- Tool: Crock Pot
- Result: Fancy Spiralled Tubers
- Note: Fillers cannot be [Meats] or more than 1 extra [Inedible]. Cannot have more than 1.0 [Monster Food].

## Examples
1. Potatoes + 2x Twigs + Ice
2. Potatoes + 2x Twigs + Berries
3. Potatoes + Twigs + Ripe Stone Fruit + Ripe Stone Fruit
4. Potatoes + Twigs + Honey + Honey
5. Potatoes + 2x Twigs + Red Cap
6. Eggplant + Potatoes + 2x Twigs (Note: This doesn't produce [Stuffed Eggplant], because Fancy Spiralled Tubers have higher priority.)

## Tips
If made with two twigs and a food item that has 12.5 hunger value or less, this dish will provide a small gain in hunger, sanity and perish time over its components. Keep in mind that it lacks the healing of a cooked potato, however.

## Trivia
Fancy Spiralled Tubers were added to Don't Starve Together in Warly's Character Update on July 25, 2019.

# Eye Bone

## Overview
The Eye Bone is an item that spawns Chester in Don't Starve. It is a naturally spawned item typically found near a cobblestone road in the Grasslands biome.

## Characteristics
- **Icon**: ![Eye Bone](Eye Bone.png)
- **Dead**: ![Eye Bone Dead](Eye Bone Dead.png)
- **Shadow**: ![Shadow Eye Bone](Shadow Eye Bone.png)
- **Shadow Dead**: ![Shadow Eye Bone Dead](Shadow Eye Bone Dead.png)
- **Snow**: ![Snow Eye Bone](Snow Eye Bone.png)
- **Snow Dead**: ![Snow Eye Bone Dead](Snow Eye Bone Dead.png)
- **Dropped**: ![Eye Bone Dropped](Eye Bone Dropped.png)
- **Does not stack**
- **Perk**: Spawns Chester
- **Spawn Code**: "chester_eyebone"

## Quotes
- Wilson: "It's looking at me."
- Willow: "It's rude to stare."
- Wolfgang: "It is eye bone. Eye bone connect to face bone."
- Wendy: "It's looking into my soul."
- WX-78: "IT IS THE DRM KEY FOR THE STORAGE UNIT"
- Wickerbottom: "Oculus Mysterium."
- Woodie: "No one ever told him it was rude to stare."
- Maxwell: "Stop looking at me!"
- Wagstaff: "Quite alluring. Especially to my furry companion."
- Wigfrid: "Who are you?"
- Webber: "Peekaboo."
- Walani: "I get the feeling I'm being watched."
- Warly: "The eye follows me wherever I go..."
- Woodlegs: "Ye got a nice eye."
- Wilba: "WEIRD BONE EYE"
- Wormwood: "Blinky!"
- Wheeler: "It's missing an eye. And everything else."
- Winona: "Toolbox controls."
- Wortox: "My, my, what do you see?"
- Wurt: "Neat!"
- Walter: "No chewing on this bone, okay Woby?"
- Wanda: "Do you ever blink?"

## Mechanics
- Chester will follow the player as long as the Eye Bone is in their inventory. It can be dropped on the ground or placed inside Chester to make him stop following.
- At night or in the Ruins, Chester will sleep until enough distance separates him and the Eye Bone. If Chester is killed, he will drop all stored items, and the Eye Bone will no longer open its eye (it remains closed). The eyelid will reopen after Chester respawns in one day.
- Splumonkeys will not steal the Eye Bone and Eyeplants will not eat it. Krampus can only steal the Eye Bone if it's in a Backpack. The Eye Bone cannot be teleported with the player via Wooden Thing (it will turn to Ashes upon arrival to the next world).
- As long as Webber is the one carrying the Eye Bone, spiders will not attack Chester. This does not apply to the Spider Queen, or the spiders spawned by her.

## Downloadable Content
In the Shipwrecked DLC, when jumping from a base game world or Reign of Giants world to a Shipwrecked world using the Seaworthy, the Eye Bone will be dropped before leaving but clicking on it will pick it up. Chester cannot be brought to a Shipwrecked world without the use of console commands or picking up the Eye Bone after it drops.

## Trivia
- Chester and the Eye Bone were added in the Spoiled Rotten update.
- The eye on the bone might belong to Chester. This could explain why it closes when Chester dies and the reason for him to follow the player.
- An Eye Bone spawned via Console will only spawn Chester one time.
- It is possible to get multiple functioning Chesters with the console, first by spawning a Chester without the Eye Bone (he will run away instead of following if the player gets close), then using the console to get another Eye Bone. This will cause the skittish Chester to connect to that particular Eye Bone and begin following it as normal.
- In DST, Eye Bone will sink in the water, however, it will return to the coast.

## Categories

## Crafting
The Brightshade Staff can only be crafted while next to the Brightsmithy, requiring 3 Pure Brilliance and 6 Brightshade Husks to craft.

## Usage
When used, the Brightshade Staff fires a homing projectile that deals 10 Planar Damage and bounces between targets 4 times to hit at maximum 5 times. If the Brightshade Helm is equipped, the Brightshade Staff will bounce between targets 6 times instead of 4 to hit at maximum 7 times.

The projectile prefers to move towards the mob closest to it and cannot hit the same target twice in a row. It deals 20 planar damage to Shadow Aligned creatures instead of 10.

When the Brightshade Staff's durability reaches 0%, it does not disappear; instead, it is unequipped and can no longer be equipped until repaired. It can be fully repaired by one Brightshade Repair Kit.
