## Quote

## Overview
Queen Bee Plain or Grasslands are a common [Biome] found in the world. They are generally safe areas with many types of useful resources. The player always spawns in a Grassland upon entry to a world, whether it be a small, zigzagged patch of green or a whole biome. Grasslands often mingle with areas of [Forest] and occasionally [Marsh].

Grasslands are characterized by their green [Grass Turf] and scattered [Evergreen]s, [Grass Tuft]s, [Sapling]s, [Carrot]s, [Flower]s, and [Berry Bush]es. [Flint] can also be found on the ground occasionally. [Beehive]s and [Pig Village]s are commonly found on Grassland terrain.

The primary dangers in Grasslands are [Spider Den]s, which are typically spread out, and [Killer Bee Hive]s, which can sometimes be found in dense formations along with regular Beehives and many Flowers. [Walrus Camps] are also more likely to spawn here than in any other biome, creating a hazard in [Winter].

There is always a [Gigantic Beehive] in Grasslands biome. [Juicy Berry Bush]es and [Twiggy Tree]s will sometimes replace all Berry Bushes and Saplings respectively in the entire world, including in this biome.

## Sections

### Bee Clearing
Bee Clearing section is a Section with [Grass Turf]. You can find here only one [Fireflies], one [Beehive]s and 6 [Flowers]. Because of this, you can often find a lot of free space in this section.

### Forest

# Glommer's Flower

## Overview
- **DLC**: Reign of Giants, Don't Starve Together
- **Item Type**: Item
- **Obtained**: Night of a Full Moon at Glommer's Statue
- **Function**: Turns Glommer into a follower

## Description
Glommer's Flower is an item found in the Reign of Giants DLC and in Don't Starve Together. It is obtained on the night of a Full Moon at Glommer's Statue where it will bloom, emitting light. Picking the flower will make the Glommer that spawned nearby follow the player as long as it is in the inventory, much like Chester. It can be used to craft the Old Bell and it is renewable, even if the statue is destroyed. The flower is viewed as edible by mobs and at danger of being eaten by Werepigs.

## Attributes
- **Image**:
  - Normal: ![Glommer's Flower](Glommer's Flower Dropped.png)
  - Dead: ![Dead Glommer's Flower](Dead Glommer's Flower Dropped.png)
- **Icon**:

  - Dead: ![Dead Glommer's Flower](Dead Glommer's Flower.png)
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "glommerflower"
- **Perk**: Turns Glommer into a follower.
- **Burn Time**: 90 sec (only when spoiling)
- **Dropped By**: Glommer's Statue
- **Spoil**: 6 days (after death of Glommer)

## Quotes

- Willow: "Why does everything have to be a flower?!"
- Wolfgang: "Is shiny flower."
- Wendy: "Flower of the night."
- WX-78: "ESPECIALLY RIGID FLOWER"
- Wickerbottom: "It's dripping with goo."
- Woodie: "Even the flower is slimy."
- Maxwell: "Flower power."
- Wagstaff: "Its smell appears to be attracting that flying creature."
- Wigfrid: "A wönder öf the wööds."

- Warly: "Tres beau!"
- Woodlegs: "Somethin' magical be linked ta this."
- Wilba: "'TIS NAUGHT THAT WHICH WILBA CALL A ROSE"
- Wormwood: "Moon Flower"
- Wheeler: "My flying buddy likes the smell."
- Winona: "That's one big flower."
- Wortox: "A flower that attracts a friend."
- Wurt: "What so special about this flower, florp?"
- Wanda: "I like anything that can make its own light."

## Usage
- **Blueprint**: Old Bell
  - **Ingredients**:
    - Glommer's Flower: 1
    - Glommer's Wings: 1

## Tips
- One way to get an Old Bell with Woodie without using the Console is to travel to a new world via the Wooden Thing with an Old Bell in the player's inventory, and pick Woodie in the new world character selection. Another way consists of planting a Lureplant close to the statue. This can also be effective, as long as the player kills it before the plant digests the flower. The Lureplant should spit the flower out.

## Trivia
- The appearance of Glommer's Flower is based on the Rafflesia.
- It cannot be destroyed by setting it or nearby objects on fire.

# Nightmare Werepig

The Nightmare Werepig is a **Boss Monster** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the Wilson Rework Update. It spawns in the **Caves**, inside the **Muddy Biome** at the start of a world. It appears to be a much larger and powerful variant of the **Werepig**.

## Behavior

The Nightmare Werepig can be found starting from day 1 in the Caves. The boss spawns ensnared by shadow chains between three **Cracked Pillar**s and asks to be released. To do this, the outer **Marble** layer needs to be mined off of each pillar with any pickaxe, then the player must make each exposed pillar to vibrate at the same time with a hit from a strong mining tool.

### Phase 0

After being freed from the chains, the Nightmare Werepig is constantly attacked by small **Parasitic Shadeling**s and is invulnerable to other attacks. The shadow creatures have 100 health and 6 movement speed. Like other shadow creatures, they can only be attacked at low **Sanity**. The pig is constantly fighting shadows and can inflict 12.5 damage to anything nearby. The player must go below the survivor's insanity threshold and kill the parasites after they are thrown off the boss. The Nightmare Werepig has a -800/min insanity aura during this phase. After all Shadelings are killed, the fight begins.

### Phase 1

The Nightmare Werepig attacks via a powerful lunge that deals 75 damage and knocks the target on the ground, which takes time getting back up. This attack will also dismount a player from riding a **Beefalo**. To dodge the lunge, the player should run diagonally towards the Nightmare Werepig. For example, if the Nightmare chases the player downwards, the player should run diagonally up just before the jump. This attack will be easier to dodge with a **Walking Cane** or other speed boosts. Between sets of jumps, it will walk slowly until the next set, which it will start running directly at the player. During this break, you can rotate the camera to a more comfortable angle to prepare for the next round. This attack is used throughout the fight, so it's important to learn how to dodge it properly.

The Nightmare Werepig has a fatigue stat that changes based on the success of its attacks. When it misses an attack, its fatigue is increased by 1, but when it lands an attack successfully, it is decreased by 1.5. Fatigue also decreases passively, with one unit after 20 seconds and then again after 10 seconds when out of combat. When the boss's fatigue reaches 3 units (3 misses), it falls to its knees and rests its paws on the ground, eliminating fatigue but allowing the player to deal significant damage. However, if you do not attack the boss while it is resting, it will rapidly regenerate 20 health units every 0.4 seconds. This state will last between 5 and 10 seconds. Successful dodging is very important in order to keep the fight short.

Between series of jumps, the Nightmare Werepig stops running around the battlefield and begins to "stalk" the player, continuously following a player with its eyes and turning its head following their movements. While stalking, it regenerates 10 health every 0.4 seconds. In addition to healing during combat, the boss also regenerates 25 health per second if the character moves far enough to end the fight.

After losing half its health, the boss enters its second phase.

### Phase 2

In the second phase, the boss begins to almost exclusively use a ground slam that deals 112.5 damage and leaving behind a short lived **Antlion**-like sinkhole with a radius of 3 units. Notably, the boss does not get fatigued from ground slam attacks, and may attack a player for as long as they remain in range and the attack is not on its short cooldown. Baiting these slam attacks from the boss is the only way to destroy the Cracked Pillars, which give 3-4 **Dreadstone**s each.

If the player is keeping their distance from the boss, they will begin "stalking" once more, healing rapidly. If players allow the boss to do this for enough time, it charges at a player with its lunge attack. After being reduced to 25% health, the boss enters its third and final phase.

### Phase 3

Phase 3 simply consists of the boss lunging at the player, interchanged with the recently introduced ground slam attack. Additionally, the boss will follow up any successful lunge attacks with a ground slam, and attack nearby players with a ground slam immediately after its fatigue ends. As the boss will begin using primarily the lunge over the slam, this phase can be handled near identically to phase 1

- **Wanda**: There's nothing wrong with a few wrinkles!

A **Lesser Glow Berry** is a *Fruit* *Food* *Item* found in *Don't Starve Together*. It is obtained by picking a *Mysterious Plant* in the *Caves*. It takes 4 days for a Lesser Glow Berry to regrow. It restores 3 *Hp* and 12.5 *Hunger* at the cost of 10 *sanity*.

The Lesser Glow Berry performs much the same as the *Glow Berry*, but with less potency. A Lesser Glow Berry only refuels *Moggles* by 45 seconds and the afterglow side effects of eating a Lesser Glow Berry last for just 60 seconds. When dropped, they will still emit enough light to protect any Survivor from *Charlie* attacks.

*Warly* can use two Lesser Glow Berries to make *Glow Berry Mousse* in his *Portable Crock Pot*.

## Recipes
- **Item1**: Lesser Glow Berry (2)
- **Item2**: Fruit
- **Item3**: Filler
- **Tool**: Portable Crock Pot
- **Result**: Glow Berry Mousse
- **Note**: Fillers cannot be *Meat* or *Twigs*.

## Tips
* Feeding Lesser Glow Berries to held *Rabbit*s, or the *Eye Mask* and *Shield of Terror* can transform them into alternative *Lantern*'s that *Wigfrid* can make use of.

## Trivia
* Survivor quotes for the Lesser Glow Berry are found in the game files of *Don't Starve*, implying that it may have been a planned feature for the original game.

## Overview
The **Deciduous Forest**, also known as **Birchnut Forest**, is a [Biome] found in the **Reign of Giants** DLC. It is very similar to the regular **Forest** biome, with the exception that all the trees are **Birchnut Trees**, which produce **Birchnut**s, and the ground is covered with **Deciduous Turf**s. The Deciduous Forest also exclusively spawns **Glommer's Statue**, which spawns **Glommer**, and **Hollow Stumps**, inhabited by **Catcoon**s. Catcoons spawn more often here than in other biomes due to the number of Hollow Stumps.

## Mushrooms
This biome is a great source of **Mushrooms**. In fact, all mushrooms (Red, Blue, and Green) can grow here, exclusively making this biome the only surface biome that is capable of having all three types.

## Don't Starve Together
In **Don't Starve Together**, the **Loot Stash** can spawn in the Deciduous Forest during **Winter**, although it may spawn in the **Mosaic** biome as well. It despawns as soon as Winter ends. In some worlds, **Twiggy Tree**s and **Juicy Berry Bush**es replace Saplings and Berry Bushes respectively, including in the Deciduous Forest. **No-Eyed Deer** also spawn in this biome.

- **Wortox**: Eep! Play nice with the imp!
- **Wurt**: Glorp! What wrong with it?!
- **Walter**: Wow! It looks even more dangerous than the usual ones!
- **Wanda**: How is it still going?

## Behavior
The Rook will raise its front leg and slam on the ground several times before charging at and ramming the player. It will also destroy anything that stands in between it and the player, including other damaged clockwork pieces. This is useful, as Damaged Clockwork Rooks will often kill other damaged chess pieces in a couple of hits. Their attacks can be used to destroy structures as well, similar to [[Deerclops]] and [[Krampus]]. When the Rook hits [[Broken Clockworks]], for example, it will quickly demolish it and leave the resources behind.

## Trivia
- The Damaged Clockwork Rook was implemented in [[Don't Starve/Version History#The Stuff of Nightmares|''The Stuff of Nightmares'']] update.
- The mobs design draws inspiration from the castle (or rook) in chess, which also can only charge ahead in straight lines.
- The Damaged Clockwork Rook looks very similar to the [[Ancient Guardian]], even possessing identical feet, possibly implying that it was made to imitate the guardian.
- It is advised to have Damaged Clockwork Rooks kill all nearby mobs and destroy all nearby debris before killing it.
- If the player dies and respawns, any items on the ground from death can be destroyed by the Clockwork Rooks charge.
- Its entirely possible Maxwell repaired the robots from the ruins and brought them to the surface. This may mean that all clockwork machines are made by the Ancient Civilization, and not Maxwell. Further proof to this is that the Clockwork Robots seem to instinctively obey whatever repairs/makes them, thus explaining why the machines are loyal to Maxwell. This does not explain, however, why they attack Maxwell as a playable character. Perhaps they are loyal to the [[Nightmare Throne]], since Maxwell repaired them while sitting on it.

They are small, red-furred pigs with spikes coming out of their nostrils and a spiked helmet on their head. They walk on all fours, unlike The Forge's boars, which are bipedal.

## Attacks
Pit Pigs have two attacks:
1. An upward swipe which only hits players in very close proximity.
2. A forward lunge, which hits players in a line ahead of it.

## Trivia
- The Pit Pig's spawn code is `"boaron"`. However, it's impossible to spawn Pit Pigs in the regular game, while the console is not available on The Forge servers.
  - According to **Rhymes with Play** #167, this name was based off of the word "baron", after its helmet.
- According to **Rhymes with Play** #167, the Pit Pig's original design was based off of a reskinned **Hound**.

## Quote
"Ugh, I feel a puzzle coming on..." - Willow

## Biome Description
The biome is decorated with **Archive Chandeliers** and **Archive Pillars**. The ground is covered with **Ancient Stonework**; like any other ground, it can be picked up with the use of a **Pitchfork**.

There are Chandeliers dangling from the ceiling, held up by chains. These are solid objects that are unlit when first entering the Ancient Archive, however upon completing the **Archive Switch set piece**, these turn on and light up the biome - resulting in the player not needing a **light source**.

The common structures are **Ancient Moon Statues**, **Ancient Lunarune Stones**, **Ancient Kilns**, **Ancient Guard Posts**, **Fountains of Knowledge**, **Archival Stone Walls**, **Archival Thulecite Walls** and some **Relics**.

The only **Mobs** are **Dust Moths** and their **Tidy Hidey-Holes** and **Sentrypede Husks**.

During **Earthquakes**, nothing will drop from the roof.

## Set Pieces
- The **Archive Switch** must be activated with the **Iridescent Gem** to turn on the lights across the biome and activate many other structures.
- The **Archive Orchestrina** is used to learn new recipes from **Distilled Knowledge**.
- The **Sealed Portal** is an unique structure without any known function as of yet.

## Trivia
- The Ancient Archive was introduced in the **Forgotten Knowledge** update.

## Description
The Beach is a biome introduced in the Shipwrecked DLC. When the player begins the game, they spawn in a Beach biome near some Debris of a broken boat. It is an excellent starting biome, having all the resources the player needs to begin the game. Bushes, Grass, Flint, and Palm Trees are plentiful, and several different kinds of Boulders can be found here. Limpets can also be harvested from their rocks, and Sandy Piles, Crabbit Dens, and Seashells can be found spread around. The Sharkitten Den also spawns in the Beach biome.

Beach biome tiles close to the sea are regularly Flooded by tides during nighttime. Tides are stronger during the Full Moon.

Beach biomes have no native Turfs and as such, any type can be put there without the need of a Pitchfork.

Toucans are the only birds that will spawn and land on this biome. During Hurricane Season, Toucans are replaced by Seagulls.

# About the Character

![Walter](Walter%20DST.png "Walter")  
| Full Name | Born | Location | Favorite Food | Curio Cabinet Bio |
|-----------|------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Walter    | April 16, ??. | Canada | ![Trail Mix](pic32) | Walter is an odd but cheerful boy, whose ability to assess danger leaves something to be desired. |
| Motto | "A Pinetree Pioneer is always prepared!" | Favorite Activities | Study cryptids and paranormal phenomena | Friends and Relatives | [[Minor_Characters|Mother]] (Associated with [[Glowcap]], [[Mothling]],(Removed) [[Basic Farm]]/[[Improved Farm]], [[Wax Paper]], [[Leaky Teacup]], [[Gingerbread Cookie]], [[Toma Root]], [[Sewing Machine]]) |

## Hitting to Constant

[Watch the Animated Short "Constant Companion"](https://youtu.be/14ou18F8bhw)

> "While in pursuit of answers to the strange and unexplained, Walter suddenly found himself lost and alone in a place unlike anything even he could have imagined. Luckily, he would not be alone for long. Even a stout-hearted Pinetree Pioneer feels a little braver with a loyal friend by their side!"

From the **Compendium**:

> "The only thing that could ever rival Walter's love for the great outdoors was his fascination with monsters and mystery. Nothing captured his interest more than a spooky story heard over the radio or a local legend about an elusive cryptid."

> "It was that pursuit of the unknown that eventually led him to the Constant. While searching for a [[Woodie|man]] who Walter believed would have answers to his questions about a mysterious creature rumored to live in the woods, he instead came upon an abandoned cabin. The owner seemed to have left hastily, leaving all their belongings behind... including an odd [[radio]] that miraculously still seemed to be working. With curiosity getting the better of him he investigated the radio further, springing a trap that had lain dormant for years.."

> "Now finding himself trapped in [[The Constant|the Constant]], Walter has befriended another lost soul - a scruffy dog named [[Woby]]. Though much about her remains a mystery, Walter has vowed to one day return her to her rightful home (after all, returning lost dogs is the Pinetree Pioneer thing to do)."

## A New Reign

He finds himself in Constant at a time when it is ruled by Charlie. There he meets a large Woby who has similar mutating abilities to Woodie. Afterwards, Walter notices Woby's collar and realizes that she was previously a dog from the ordinary world.

# Trivia

## In-Game

- Walter's quotes for the [[Farm|Farm Plots]] and [[Critters|Mothling]] show that he has a mother who disliked his love of bugs and collected porcelain ([[Trinkets|Leaky teacup]]: "My mom would kill me if I cracked her fine china").
- Some of Walter and Woodie's quotes for one another suggest that Walter is Canadian.
- Many of Walter's quotes for a [[Wes]] player suggest that he has Coulrophobia.
- Walter hates [[asparagus]] and [[Fig|figs]], according to his quotes for them and their dishes.
- In DST, [[Willow quotes|Willow's quote]] for [[Watermelon]] used to be "I once knew a melon named Walter. He was a jerk." and it was changed to "But where's the firemelon?" as of the ''[[Return of Them#She Sells Sea Shells|She Sells Sea Shells]]'' update. The same was done for her Grilled Watermelon quote which was changed from "Warm, sweet, juicy Walter." to "I made my own firemelon." These quotes were changed to avoid confusion over the new character.
  - Willow's original Watermelon and Grilled Watermelon quotes mentioning Walter are still intact in Singleplayer.
  - Joe W further confirmed that Willow did not know Walter on the Klei forums.
- Sometimes a message like this may appear during the loading screen in DST: "Walter's time in the Pinetree Pioneers has made him more prepared than most for surviving in the wilderness. Unfortunately, this is undermined somewhat by his blind fascination with monsters."

# Disease in Don't Starve Together

## Overview
_Disease_ was a feature in **Don't Starve Together** that affected replanted plants, introduced in the **A New Reign** update and removed in **Reap What You Sow**. Diseased plants appeared surrounded by flies, darkened in color, and eventually died without dropping resources, instead yielding **Rot** when picked or dug up with a **Shovel**.

## Mechanics
- After replanting, a plant has a 50-day timer before it has a 10% chance to become diseased.
- If disease fails, the timer resets to a value between 30-70 days.
- Characters provide warnings when harvesting plants for 4-6 days before they become diseased.
- Disease spreads to nearby replanted crops every 1.5-2.5 days without warning.
- Players can dig up plants in the warning phase to reset the timer or to prevent the disease from spreading.

## Quotes
Here are some quotes from characters when examining diseased plants:

- **Wilson**: "It looks pretty sick."
- **Willow**: "Burn the sick!"
- **Wolfgang**: "Is weak. Sickly!"
- **Wendy**: "It's not long for this world..."
- **WX-78**: "HA. DISEASE. A BIOLOGICAL LAPSE IN JUDGMENT"
- **Wickerbottom**: "It's afflicted with an agrarian disease beyond my curing."
- **Woodie**: "It's caught a bit of a bug."
- **Maxwell**: "What has brought this blight upon my world?"
- **Wigfrid**: "The disease festers within its söul."
- **Webber**: "Maybe it needs some chicken soup?"
- **Winona**: "Maybe you oughta take a sick day..."
- **Warly**: "It's got food poisoning."
- **Wortox**: "Now it stinks really good!"
- **Wormwood**: "Sick! Very, very sick!"
- **Wurt**: "Won't make snacks if sick, florp."
- **Walter**: "Uh, something's definitely wrong with it."

## Trivia
- Disease was added to the game before **A New Reign** was announced, and Grass Gekkos and Twiggy Trees were also able to become diseased initially.
- Unused sprites for Diseased Logs, Juicy Berries, and dug versions of each plant exist in the game files.
- Disease could be toggled off and on in World Customization before creating a world.
- Disease was removed after the **Reap What You Sow** update on December 15th, 2020.

## Prevention Strategies
- Replace basic resources like saplings and grass tufts with spiky bushes/Twiggy Trees and grass gekkos.
- Use Wickerbottom's Applied Horticulture to instantly Ripen saplings, grass tufts, berry bushes, etc., making disease less threatening.
- Collect Lichen in the Ruins using the Bundling Wrap blueprint and Meatbulbs.
- Utilize Bull Kelp as a non-renewable but disease-free food source.
- Opt for Stone Fruit Bushes over Berry Bushes for mass farming without disease or fertilization needs.
- Collect Tumbleweed in the Desert for grass and twigs.

# Fish

There are 2 basic **Fish** [Food] [Items] in **Don't Starve**; [Fish] and [Eel] (There are 16 additional types in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC and 13 additional types in **Don't Starve Together**). Fish can be obtained by [Fishing] in [Pond]s on either the [Surface World] or the [Caves], and as a drop from [Merm]s / [Merm Head]s. Eels, however, can only be fished from Ponds found in the [Ruins]. Both types of Fish are a subtype of [Meats], and as such, can be used as Meat fillers in the [Crock Pot] and be eaten by [Wigfrid]. In **Don't Starve Together** [Ocean Fishes] can be fished from the [Ocean] with the [Sea Fishing Rod].

Mobs such as [Pigs], [Spider]s or [Hound]s will eat any form of dropped Fish on the ground. Additionally, [Bunnymen] will be aggressive towards a player if they have any item on this list.

## Usage

* There are 4 Crock Pot recipes that require Fish meat. Three of the recipes, [Fish Tacos], [Fishsticks], and California Rolls will accept both Fish or Eel, while [Unagi] only accepts Eel. (There are 12 additional recipes in the **Shipwrecked** DLC.)
* Many of the Fish can be dried on a [Drying Rack], resulting in [Jerky], a much longer-lasting food item with different [Hunger], [Sanity], and [Health] bonuses. Most of the Fish can also be used in [Crock Pot] recipes.
* Many Fish have both a [Crock_Pot#Food_values|Meat Value] and a [Crock_Pot#Food_values|Fish Value] when used in a Crock Pot, giving a wide variety of potential recipes.

Water Beefalo, also known as Ox, are the Shipwrecked version of Beefalo. They have the same characteristics as Beefalo, with the only differences being that the Water Beefalo do not drop Beefalo Wool if killed, they run faster than regular Beefalo, and they drop Horns instead of Beefalo Horns. They are native to the Mangrove biome and are usually found with a small herd. While they spend most of their time in water, they can also walk on land.

Similar to Beefalo, Water Beefalo will periodically drop Manure. When one of them is attacked, the entire herd will rush to their defense. They will huddle together at Dusk and sleep through the Night. Water Beefalo also go through a mating season. During this time, the Water Beefalo will remain neutral on water but be hostile on land.

## Description
Stuffed Night Cap is a Meat Food Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in the From Beyond updates. It is cooked in the Crock Pot by combining 2 raw Moon Shrooms, 1 raw Monster Meat, and a filler. Its purpose is to put Meat-eating Creatures to sleep. When a creature eats a Stuffed Night Cap, it will sleep for 20 seconds unless attacked. When consumed, it restores 18.75 Hunger, but at a cost of 20 Health and 15 Sanity. It also puts the Character to sleep.

## Recipe

## Description
A **Rotten Egg** is produced by allowing an uncooked [Egg](Egg) to spoil. Unlike most foods, which turn to [Rot](Rot) when they spoil, Eggs become Rotten Eggs.

Rotten Eggs can be used to fertilize crops or as fuel in a [Campfire](Campfire) or [Fire Pit](Fire_Pit). Rotten Eggs can also be used to craft [Gunpowder](Gunpowder); an explosive which deals 200 damage and can destroy most [structures](structures).

## Gathering
Eggs come from [Birds](Birds) imprisoned in [Birdcages](Birdcage). Feeding the Bird any [Meats](Meats) (besides raw [Monster Meat](Monster_Meat) except in DST) will produce an Egg. Once the Egg is allowed to spoil, it will become a Rotten Egg.

Rotten Eggs can also be found lying on the ground in [Pengull](Pengull) nesting areas at the end of [Winter](Winter), a quick and safe way to obtain many Rotten Eggs.

## Usage
### Crafting Gunpowder
- **Ingredients**: 1 Rotten Egg, 1 Charcoal, 1 Nitre
- **Result**: Gunpowder
- **Tool**: Alchemy Engine

## Resources
- **Food**: [Food and Edible Items](Food_and_Edible_Items)

# About the Character

![Wes](Wes.png)

| Attribute       | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Full Name       | Wes         |
| Born           | May 7, ??    |
| Location       | France      |
| Favorite Food   | Spicy Chili |
| Curio Cabinet Bio | Wes is a mime of many thoughts, but few words. |
| Motto          | ...         |

# Entering The Constant

[![Entering The Constant](https://youtu.be/ao61s4M7rtA)](https://youtu.be/ao61s4M7rtA)

The events of his short were later officially summarized in DST's Compendium:
> Despite a life plagued by terrible luck, Wes has never been one to utter so much as a word of complaint. Rather than dwell on his own troubles, he has instead dedicated his life to making others smile... even if it's at his own expense.

> His journey to the Constant itself was nothing if not a tragic comedy of errors. After a series of snowballing missteps, Wes found himself accidentally taking the place of a stranger caught in the grip of a shadowy portal bound for the Constant. His unexpected arrival infuriated the Nightmare King, who quickly exacted his vengeance on the poor mime for interfering with his plans. Wes was banished to his own private prison, far from sight, where he would remain until he was rescued by the Constant's other Survivors (being the kind soul that he is, Wes holds no grudge against Maxwell... though he does continue to give him the silent treatment.)

> Had Wes known what fate awaited him on his last day on Earth, he likely wouldn't have done anything differently. In truth, there is a part of him that is happy to be in the Constant with the other Survivors - for who could be in greater need of cheering up than those poor souls?

The event takes place a few years after 1906. Wes does pantomime on the street and earns money from passers-by who give him money. At one point, he notices the daughter of George T. Witherstone in the window from the houses. Wes tries to return the fallen doll with a balloon, but the doll with the balloon flies away, so Wes tries to catch up with the balloon. Along the way, he accidentally angers two crows and catches the doll. He then accidentally runs into George T. Witherstone, who was trying to steal Maxwell. Due to the collision, instead of George T. Witherstone, Maxwell steals Wes and two crows, causing them to spread throughout Constant. Apparently, George T. Witherstone and his daughter only recently moved into their new home.

Since Maxwell didn't want to steal Wes, he locks him in an invisible cage held by Maxwell statues. After this, Wes will be in a cage until someone frees him.

# Don't Starve Together

[![Don't Starve Together](https://youtu.be/Nf2Stngxj0U)](https://youtu.be/Nf2Stngxj0U)

At one point (which occurs after the fall of the moon island), Wes has a dream in which he saves Wilson from Bearger using a robot made of balloons. In his dream, he loses and wakes up in the same place where Wortox and Krampus robbed him earlier.

# The Lost Fragment Mod

![The Lost Fragment Mod](The Lost Fragment mod.jpg =350x)

**The Lost Fragment** is a mod made by **Klei** downloaded by clicking the film reel from this [page](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/max/stage/disaster.html). This mod was a part of one of the **William Carter Puzzles** that reveal canon information about the character **Maxwell**.

## Installation and Activation
Upon adding the mod to the **Don't Starve** folder and enabling it in the main menu, the player will be able to craft a special **Magic Tab** structure, the **Shadow Portal**. On activation, a "Neat!" or "Nope" prompt will appear, similar to the one prompt that appears from activating **Maxwell's Door**.

## Fragmented World
The portal will send the player to a small island consisting of one **Spiky Tree** and parts of a **Chess** **biome** floor. Nearby is a **Skull Chest** containing both a **Dark Sword** and **Night Armor**. Upon opening the chest, the player must battle a **Shadow Maxwell** who is equipped with his own Dark Sword and a special **Telelocator Staff**, with the ability to summon high-damage explosive meteors which can easily kill the player in one hit, should they go about unarmored. The landing point for each meteor is telegraphed by their shadow.

Upon defeating waves of **Shadow Maxwells**, the portal will reactivate, and interacting with it will bring the player back to their current world, with all items intact. If the player sticks around after beating the arena, they can activate the special shadow **Phonograph** that will spawn. It will play Morse code when turned on, that when translated, says "exordium". Entering the password to [this page](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/max/process.php) will redirect the player to [a hidden video webpage](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/max/stage/1/grand-finale.html).

## Trivia

- There is a broken bridge leading to a large island, unreachable without cheats. On this island are a few plants that can be typically found in the **Grassland** **biomes**. An easy way to reach the island is to use a **Telelocator Staff** using `c_give ("telestaff")` on the console.
- The crafting quote for the **Shadow Portal** ("Oh, the places you'll see.") is a reference to **Oh, the Places You'll Go!**, a book by Dr. Seuss.
- The author listed for the mod is **Mr. Skitts**.

## Quote
> I suspect some property in the water caused it to change. - Wickerbottom

## Description
The **Lunar Grotto** is a **Caves** **Biome** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. It naturally occurs next to a Blue **Mushtree Forest** within the Caves, and always connects to the **Ancient Archive**. **Moon Glass** structures known as **Vitreoases** and **Small Vitreoases** are common in the Lunar Grotto, appearing alongside flora such as **Light Flower**s and **Lunar Mushtree**s on **Mutated Fungal Turf**.

Players will have their **Sanity** replaced with **Enlightenment** throughout the entire biome, just like the **Lunar Island** on the Surface.

## Mobs
A variety of **Mobs** appear within the Lunar Grotto:
- **Mush Gnome**s occasionally sprout out of the ground
- **Bulbous Lightbug**s spawn from picked **Light Flowers**
- **Carrat**s fall from the ceiling during **Earthquakes**
- Hostile **Naked Mole Bat**s may fall from the ceiling

After the **Archive Switch** within the Ancient Archives has been activated, **Greater Gestalt**s and **Shadow Creature**s from **Nightmare Rampart**s will continuously spawn on the edge of the biome bordering the **Blue Mushtree** Forest, fighting each other.

## Earthquakes
Earthquakes will drop:
- **Rock**s
- **Flint**
- **Moon Glass**
- **Naked Mole Bat**s
- **Carrats**
- **Stone Fruit** with a 20% chance each.

## Tips
- Wearing the **Bone Helm** prevents attacks from the many **Shadow Creature**s that appear after the Archive Switch was activated.
- Greater Gestalts attack any player who has a **Dark Sword**, **Night Armor**, or a fueled **Alarming Clock** equipped.

## Trivia
- The Lunar Grotto was introduced in the **[Return of Them#Forgotten Knowledge|Forgotten Knowledge]** update.
- For some retrofitted worlds, the Lunar Grotto is separated from the rest of the cave and players must use a **Worm Hole** situated in a Blue Mushtree Forest to get into the biome. This worm hole does not drain sanity when traversed.

## Quote
> "Nice day for swim?" - Wormwood

The **Lily Pond** is a **Biome** introduced in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It is the only biome in this DLC which is completely made of water, and thus the only biome where the player is able to craft a **Boat** or **Raft**, or where **Walani** is able to use her **Surfboard**, similar to **Ocean** from **Shipwrecked** DLC.

When the player is **insane**, being in this biome will spawn **Swimming Horror** instead of **Crawling Horror** and **Terrorbeak**.

**Lotus Flowers** and **Reeds** can be collected in this biome, **Lily Pads** also appear here (though they cannot be collected), and in the Dusk and Night **Mosquitoes** will spawn above the water. This biome is also where **Hippopotamoose** can be found. They cause **Waves** to spread across the water when they jump in.

When a **Lotus Flower** is picked out of a **Lotus Plant**, there is a great chance that a **Platapine** will spawn, darting out of or across the water and consuming the other **Lotus Flowers** nearby.

**BFB** hardly enters this biome. During **Lush Season**, **Bramble**s seem to avoid spawning in this biome. There are also no birds that spawn and land on this biome.

# Weapons in Don't Starve

Weapons are Items used to fight, hunt, and defend oneself from creatures in Don't Starve. Most weapons have a durability, limiting the number of times it can be used. In the hostile wilderness, a player's bare hands won't stand up well to many of the hostile creatures found or be able to hunt very effectively, while running can get one safely out of harm's way at first, a player will need to start utilizing weapons for self-defense, hunting, and especially for the periodic Hound attacks, or other fast, persistent enemies.

Some characters have personal damage modifiers. Wes and Wendy deal normal damage × 0.75, Wigfrid deals normal damage × 1.25, Wolfgang deals normal damage × 0.50-2.00 (based on Hunger level). All characters' unarmed attacks deal 10 points of damage per hit, and can be executed only once every second while armed ones can be executed twice, making characters' unarmed attacks impractical for combat.

Any other item that equips to the hand slot, such as Divining Rod and Umbrella, can be used to attack with the use of the Force Attack command/button, but will only do as much damage as an unarmed attack. Using items this way won't deplete the item's durability any more than holding it normally does.

Characters deal 2 hits per second. With that information, it is possible to determine damage per second for every weapon with that simple formula: 2 * damage of the weapon

## Melee Weapons

| Item | Name | DLC | Damage | Uses | Crafting | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Dark Sword] | Dark Sword |  | 68 | 100 | Nightmare Fuel x5, Living Log x1 | It also drains 20/min sanity causing you to go insane quicker than using some other weapon |
| ![Cutlass Supreme] | Cutlass Supreme | Shipwrecked, Hamlet | 68 (102 damageAsSeal=127.5) | 150 | Swordfish x1, Gold Nugget x2, Twigs x1 | It is the strongest non-situational melee weapon in the single-player game, as it does the same damage as the Dark Sword, but with more uses, thus having the highest potential damage, while not having the drawbacks of either weapon, and dealing bonus damage to one enemy. It does an additional 34 damage to the Sealnado. |
| ![Thulecite Club] | Thulecite Club |  | 59.5 | 150 | Living Log x3, Thulecite x4, Nightmare Fuel x4 | It also boosts walking speed by 10% (when equipped) and has a 20% chance to spawn a Shadow Tentacle. |
| ![Ham Bat] | Ham Bat |  | 29.75 - 59.5 | (Rot 10 days) | Pig Skin x1, Twigs x2, Meat x2 | With the Reign of Giants DLC, the Ham Bat's damage decreases by 2.975 damage per day. On day 10, the weapon will deal 29.75 damage before turning to Rot. |
| ![Obsidian Spear] | Obsidian Spear | Shipwrecked | 51 - 102 (damageAsWes=76.5, damageAsWigfrid=127) | 375 | Spear x1, Obsidian x3, Dragoon Heart x1 | When used to attack, it will become charged causing it to deal up to a maximum of 2x damage after 30 hits. It also produces heat and light when charged. |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Tools

Tools can also be used as weapons and have varying amounts of damage and durability. Golden versions of each tool do the same damage and have 4 times the durability. Obsidian versions of each tool have 2.5 times the durability, and upon being used will charge up. When fully charged they will set targets on fire and deal up to 2x the damage of regular tools, making them a good defensive weapon if you're ambushed.

| Item | Name | DLC | Damage | Uses | Crafting | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![PickSlashAxe] | Pick/Axe |  | 30.6 | 400 | Luxury Axe x1, Opulent Pickaxe x1, Thulecite x2 |  |
| ![Obsidian Machete] | Obsidian Machete | Shipwrecked | 29.92 - 59.84 (damageAsWes=44.88) | 250 | Machete x1, Obsidian x3, Dragoon Heart x1 | When used to attack or hack,

# White Whale

The **White Whale** is a hostile [Animal] that has a chance to spawn after the player has tracked it down by examining [Suspicious Bubbles], during [Hurricane Season] or [Dry Season]. This chance starts at 5% on [day] 1 and increases as days go by to a maximum of 33% on day 100. In [Mild Season] and [Monsoon Season], the White Whale will not be encountered regardless of the day counter. They are considered innocent creatures despite being hostile, and killing one adds 6 points to the player's [Krampus#Naughtiness|naughtiness] level.

## Behavior

The White Whale will attack the player if the player gets too close. Each attack is performed as melee, spawning two [Waves|Big Waves]. A player can safely kite one with an attack pattern of 3-4 swings, depending on movement speed. If more than one White Whale are close together they will attack each other.

## Hunting

By investigating some Suspicious Bubbles, the player can find a White Whale. These can be found randomly in the deep ocean [biome] and will change locations if ignored for a period of time. Once investigating Suspicious Bubbles three will pop in the same direction, if followed it will lead to another Suspicious Bubbles or the White Whale approximately two screens away. Upon uncovering the final bubble (there can be between 6 and 12 per hunt), the character will alert the player that the creature is close and a White whale will be spawned rather than another bubble. Note there is a 2/3 chance that a [Blue Whale] will spawn instead.

Once killed, the White Whale will drop a White Whale Carcass. The behavior of a White Whale Carcass is similar as a Blue Whale's, see [Blue Whale] for more advice on how to harvest the loots.

## Possible Random Items

### High Quality Items (low drop chance, rolls 2 items)

- [Coconade]
- [Top Hat]
- [Thatch Sail]
- [Particulate Purifier]
- [Sleep Dart]
- [Poison Dart]
- [Fire Dart]
- [Cutlass Supreme]

### Medium Quality Items (medium drop chance, rolls 3 items)

- [Cloth Sail]
- [Dead Wobster]
- [Spear Gun]
- [Coconut]
- [Boat Lantern]
- [Bottle Lantern]
- [Spyglass]
- [Captain Hat]
- [Pirate Hat]
- [Spear]
- [Sea Trap]
- [Machete]
- [Empty Bottle]

### Low Quality Items (high drop chance, rolls 4 items)

- [Blubber]
- [Raw Fish]
- [Bone Shards]
- [Seaweed]
- [Jellyfish]
- [Coral]
- [Vine]
- [Bamboo]

## Tips

* The White Whale cannot be set on fire.

## Trivia

* The White Whale is a direct reference to [Wikipedia:Moby-Dick|Moby-Dick], an 1851 novel about a hostile albino sperm whale. This is further supported by the Harpoon embedded in the whale's head.
* Although Moby Dick is a sperm whale, the White Whale appears to be a rorqual.
* The Harpoon in the whale's head may have been shot in there by Maxwell, as indicated by his quote "We meet again". This may also be another reference to Moby-Dick, with Maxwell's animosity towards the whale paralleling that of Ahab.
* Upon examination, [Wickerbottom] states "A white whale! If only there were a book about such a thing!", which is a probable reference to the existing book Moby Dick.
* The White Whale is the Shipwrecked equivalent of the [Varg] from [Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants].

# About the Character

![Wanda](Wanda_DST.png =257x257)

| Full Name | Wanda |
|-----------|-------|
| Age       | Oscillating |
| Born      | August 8, ?? |
| Favorite Food | ![Taffy](pic32) |
| Curio Cabinet Bio | Wanda is a skilled clockmaker who will stop at nothing to outrun her future. |
| Motto | "Time! I just need more time!" |
| Favorite activities | Clocksmithing, tinkering |
| Friends and Relatives | Her [baba](#), a mysterious entity[^1] |

# Backstory

[Watch the animated short "Long Shadows" here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBMGeWuxIQs)

An official summary of the short was provided in DST's Compendium:
> An enigmatic woman of... well, fluctuating age, Wanda was torn from the world she knew after accidentally creating a fracture in time and space, pulling her from her own timeline into the land of the Constant. Though she avoids divulging many details of her past with the other Survivors, she seems to have an odd familiarity with them, as though she's run into them before... or perhaps, later?

We know for sure only her connection to the shadows and the fact that she made a deal with some sort of a mysterious entity.

# Assumptions

* Based on her examination quote for [Florid Postern](#), it is possible that the mysterious entity with what Wanda made a deal is the author of [Codex Umbra].
* She knew about all the gems except of the [green ones](#).
* Presumably this is because the mysterious entity didn't want to let Wanda multiplying the materials that it gave or was giving her by using [Deconstruction Staff] and [Construction Amulet] in pair.

# Trivia

- Her quotes constantly refer to the fact that she's in a hurry somewhere, despite some abilities associated with time.
- She seems to have experienced [Wagstaff] picking up the [Lunar Essence Extractor] with lunar energy in a previous timeline.[^2]
- Apparently, she made some kind of deal with a "mysterious entity" which gave her the knowledge of using shadow magic for time travel. Wanda also states how she wasn't told about the green gems before. She also says: "There's no need to be afraid of curses if you're clever enough to outsmart them."
- In her examination quote for Festive Lights, Wanda mentions "electric candles". "Electric candle" is another name for Yablochkov candles, a type of arc lamp invented in 1876 by Russian inventor Pavel Nikolayevich Yablochkov, with her examination quote seeming to imply that she originates from not long after their invention.
- Electric street lamps are seen on the street outside her workshop in her character short, differentiated from the commonly used gas lamps by the electrical crackle when shut off by the encroaching [Shadow Hands].
- Instead of dying like any other survivor she travels back in time to the point before entering [the Constant].

# Summary

One of the simplest, and first farms a player can generally make is for **Berry Bushes**. In essence, simply digging up and moving Berry Bushes from across the world to their base. Once **fertilized**, this acts as a great farm for fillers in many **Crock Pot** recipes; the classic **Meatballs** being made with nothing but a **Monster Meat** and three **Berries**.

But we can do better than this. There are a few additions to this simple farm setup, the first of which is a **Lightning Rod**. This is vital for the farm, as Berry Bushes are incredibly flammable, and when packed tightly together, one unlucky lightning cast could be disastrous.

Using an **Ice Flingomatic** isn't necessarily essential, as it depends on if the player is using a 'Summer Base', as either the **Oasis** or in the **Caves**. The **The Constant** **Fire#Downloadable Content|wildfires** during **Seasons/Summer|Summer** are dreadful, so if you are planning on staying home during the season, ensure you have an **Ice Flingomatic** placed down too.

However, what makes the **Incredible Inedible** so special is the dual-functionality of the farm. While **Gobblers** appear to be an unlucky spawn to new players, as the turkey runs around eating all of their Berries, these creatures can be easily tricked and killed. Once spawned, if the Gobbler spots something edible on the floor nearby, it will instantly walk towards it in the hopes of a snack. This works in our favour, as we can place some simple **Wood Fence|Fences** in-between it and the food on the floor. ![Simple incredible inedible](Simple_incredible_inedible.png)

While the designs can vary, in its most basic form, the **Incredible Inedible** is having Berry Bushes surrounding a food item on the floor with **Wood Fence|Fences** around it. Creating a pen with a **lightning rod|Lightning Rod** and **Powdercake** with Berry Bushes around it is the most efficient design, as the picture (minus the Lightning Rod) shows. Ensure that you mainly harvest the Berries during the **day**, as **Gobblers** will instantly flee to another bush during **dusk** or **night**. The **Gobblers** will spawn, track the **Powdercake**, and walk into the fences. Free Berries and **Drumsticks**! You'll have virtually everything you need for a **Turkey Dinner**.

# Exclusivity: Don't Starve Together

The **Shadow Prison** and the **Shadow Sneak** are unique objects that can be summoned by **Maxwell**. They are traps used in combat.

## Shadow Sneak

### Shadow Sneak Crafting Image
![Shadow Sneak](Shadow Sneak.png)

- **Sanity Decrease**: 15
- **Durability**: 3 days
- **Spawn Code**: "shadow_trap"

The **Shadow Sneak** looks like a shadow butterfly. When casted, it is set on the ground like a Tooth Trap. If a creature enters the trap's range, the trap activates, frightening all creatures around it: creatures go into panic for 12 seconds. In this state, they cannot attack and start running aimlessly around the area, losing 1/3 of their movement speed. After being summoned, the trap stays charged for three in-game days, and then disappears. Bosses are immune from the Shadow Sneak.

The trap turns **Rabbit**s, **Bunnyman**s, and **Splumonkey**s into their shadow versions, as those can be seen by the player at low **sanity** or during a **Nightmare Cycle**, for the length of one day (8 minutes). Transformed creatures are guaranteed to drop one **Nightmare Fuel** on death. Also, under the influence of a trap, **Spider Gland** always drops from the **Spider**.

## Shadow Prison

### Shadow Prison Crafting Image
<gallery>
![Shadow Prison1](Shadow Prison1.png)
![Shadow Prison](Shadow Prison.png)
![Shadow Prison2](Shadow Prison2.png)
![Shadow Prison3](Shadow Prison3.png)
</gallery>

- **Sanity Decrease**: 15
- **Durability**: 
  - 24 sec
  - 12 sec (around bosses)
  - 6 sec (around player)
- **Spawn Code**: "shadow_pillar"

The **Shadow Prison** spell will trap creatures within shadow columns for a while. All creatures includes flying creatures can be trapped, except shadow creatures. Depending on the type of creature, the duration of the trap varies: 24 seconds for normal creatures, 12 seconds for bosses, and 6 seconds for other players in PVP mode. Imprisonment time is reduced if the trapped creature is attacked. Shadow Prison does not damage targets but will aggro them.

Before the Shadow Prison disappears, the columns will shake and warn the player the Prison is about to expire.

# How to extract animations from the game

## 1. Programs and Downloads
First, you need to download and install **Spriter**, a free 2D animation program from BrashMonkey. It can be used to access the sprite animations and export them for example. You can find and download the newest versions [here](https://brashmonkey.com/download_spriter/).

Second, you need to download Simplex' **ktools** to be able to convert the game files into Spriter project files. These are found [here](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/files/file/583-ktools-cross-platform-modding-tools-for-dont-starve/), but you need to have an user account at the [Klei Forums](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/) to be allowed to download them. Their readme with more detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/nsimplex/ktools/blob/master/README.md).

ktools contains two programs: **ktech** and **krane**. ktech can be used to convert bidirectionally between [TEX] files (without animations) and PNG, but this can also be more easily done using Matt's [TEX Tools](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/files/file/73-matts-tools/). So krane is actually what we are looking for. It has recently been updated to support animations with more than four sides (for example the eight-faced walls in DST and SW).

## 2. Get the files
krane needs three input files in order to create a working Spriter project file. These can be found packed in zip files in:

`C:\Programs\Steam\steamapps\common\Don't Starve\data\anim`

or

`C:\Programs\Steam\steamapps\common\Don't Starve Together\data\anim`

Copy the zip file of your choice into another folder (always create a safety backup!), then unzip it. You should now have three files:
- `anim.bin`
- `atlas-0.tex`
- `build.bin`

If you are missing the `anim` file, then this object/mob/etc. you're trying to extract may have other versions or states in a different zip file. For example, Snow and Shadow Chester have their own `atlas` and `build`, but use the `anim` of the standard version, because their motions are the same. So you may need to copy another zip file and unzip it, but only use the `anim` file, be careful not to overwrite the other two.

## 3. Get krane to work
Now it's getting a bit weird. Open `cmd.exe` and enter the following input all in one line:

`Directory\Path\To\ktools\krane` 

`Directory\Path\To\anim.bin` 

`Directory\Path\To\build.bin` 

`Directory\Path\To\Output\Folder\` 

For example: 

`C:\Users\MMueck>Downloads\ktools\krane` 

`Downloads\Sample\anim.bin` 

`Downloads\Sample\build.bin` 

`Downloads\Sample\Output\`

Then execute. If the output folder doesn't exist yet, it will be created automatically.

If everything worked and krane says "Done.", you will find a bunch of folders in your chosen output folder and a `.scml file`. This is the project file you can now open in Spriter.

## 4. In Spriter
Opening the project file, you should now see the object in the main animation window. In the down right corner you should see a list of available animations.

Let's say, if you need to extract only one frame for a wiki page for example, choose the `Idle` animation, then go to 

`File > Export Animation To PNG/GIF..`

Set `Source frames > images` to `1` and then hit `Export`. You should now get a PNG file of the first frame of the `Idle` animation.

Of course, you could also export animations to GIF files and what not, but I have to admit, that this is all the experience I had with Spriter so far. So as I am not an expert, if there is any way to make this process easier or shorter, please let me know. Also if there are any questions or problems, please don't hesitate to ask.

## Description

A **Touch Stone** is a structure found randomly on the surface world. They can be haunted by **Ghost Characters** as a means of resurrection. A single Touch Stone can be used more than once by different players, regenerating quickly after use. After resurrection, the Touch Stone cracks and drops 2 **Marble**s, 2 **Rocks**, and 1 **Nightmare Fuel**.

A Touch Stone is always surrounded by 4 **Pig Heads**. The Pig Heads are not needed for the Touch Stone to function and can safely be deconstructed using a **Hammer**. The **Wooden Flooring** can also be taken without affecting the Touch Stone's usability.

Players can tell which Touch Stones they have and haven't used by the runes present on the Stone's surface; if the runes are glowing in white, the Touch Stone can be used, while if the runes aren't glowing, the Touch Stone has already been used. Using the **Celestial Portal** to switch character resets Touch Stone usage.

It is advisable for other players to remain off-screen during a resurrection as the **Lightning** produced may strike them instead of the Touch Stone.

Touch Stones can also be found in the **Caves**, unlike in the single player version of the game.

## Player's Stats Upon Revival

- **Health** is set to 50
- **Hunger** is set to 2/3 of maximum
- **Sanity** is set to 1/2 of maximum
- Penalties that normally afflict the player upon death and in other revival circumstances, such as empty **inventory** (items can be recovered at the place of death, as long as they haven't been destroyed by any means) and reset of most **Characters** abilities (e.g., **Wilson** and **Webber** will be beardless; **WX-78** loses all Circuits; **Abigail**'s power resets to zero, etc.).

## Tips

- Being revived by the Touch Stone does not put any nearby Mobs to sleep.
- Placing a **Campfire** and a chest (or two) near the Touch Stone can increase chances of survival after being resurrected. This is especially useful in **Winter** or **Summer**.
  - Useful items to stock the chest(s) or nearby include:
    - **Thermal Stone**
    - **Weapon** and **Armor**
    - Any food source that doesn't spoil such as a **Tallbird Egg**, **Bundled Supplies**, or nearby **Berry Bushes**
    - **Healing Salve**s
    - Portable light such as a **Miner Hat** or extra resources/tools to create enough light to make it back to a base/camp (e.g., a spare **Axe**).
    - **Wetness** resisting items, hence a **Straw Hat** or **Umbrella** for **Spring**.
    - **Cooling Items** such as a **Chilled Amulet** and resources for an **Endothermic Fire** for **Summer**.
    - **Overheating** protection items for Summer, insulating items for **Winter**.
- The player is advised not to leave flammable items in the wooden square

## Behavior
Palm Treeguards are hostile Boss Monsters in the Shipwrecked DLC. They are the Palm Tree equivalent of Treeguards, and like Treeguards, may spawn as a result of cutting down a nearby Palm Tree. Assuming enough palm trees are nearby, a minimum of two Palm Treeguards always appear when the spawn condition is met. With growing day count, the maximum number of Treeguards spawned rises - to four from day 30, to five on day 80.

When killed, they drop two Coconuts and, like Treeguards, Monster Meat and six Living Logs.

### Attacking Strategy
- **Ranged Attacks**: Coconuts thrown at and around the player, roughly five at a time.
- **Melee Attacks**: Very similar to a regular Treeguard's, and can be avoided by keeping a distance away from them.

### Appeasement
Planting Jungle Tree Seeds or Coconuts will appease Palm Treeguards, much like the normal Treeguards, who can be appeased by planting Pine Cones close to them. Planting one within 16 units away has a 15% chance to pacify them, while within 5 units away has a 33% chance.

### Fighting Strategy
- Leading them through a Campfire or to a krissure to burn them.
- Hitting them 5-7 times as soon as they pull a coconut from their torso.
- Utilizing puddles to dodge their coconut throws.

## Trivia
- The Palm Treeguard is the only one of its kind referred to as "treeguard" in the game files. Normal Treeguards and lumpy evergreen Treeguards are referred to as "leif" or "leif_sparse", respectively.
