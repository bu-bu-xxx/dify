# Hostile Flare

Exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, the Hostile Flare is a craftable item found in the **Tools filter**. It requires 3 **Flares** and 1 **Glommer's Goop** to craft and does not need to be prototyped.

## Description

Light a beacon for your enemies.

## Ingredients

- Flare (multiplier 3)
- Glommer's Goop (multiplier 1)

  ![Hostile Flare Water Dropped](Hostile%20Flare%20Water%20Dropped.png "On Water") | On Water
</details>

## Usage

When placed on the ground and lit with a **Torch** or a **Willow's Lighter**, the Flare will shoot up into the sky. It then creates three flare marks on the map, unlike a normal Flare that only creates one mark.

After activation, it has a chance to spawn various enemies. There is a 60% chance to spawn **Deerclops** and/or an existing **MacTusk N' Son** hunting party near the player when used on land during **Winter**. If used on a **Boat** with no **Powder Monkey** nearby, a **Pirate Raid** has a 60% chance to appear.

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: It will let everything know I'm here. Everything.
- **Willow**: Heheh... let's start some trouble!
- **Wolfgang**: Wolfgang will be careful with that one.
- **Wendy**: I could just let the monsters come for me...
- **WX-78**: MINION! TAKE THIS FAR AWAY AND SET IT OFF
- **Wickerbottom**: I can lure adversaries to a place of my choosing.
- **Woodie**: That'll definitely get someone... or something's attention.
- **Maxwell**: I'd have to be foolish or desperate to use that.
- **Wigfrid**: I fear no enemy. Let them come!
- **Webber**: Ms. Wickerbottom says we shouldn't pick fights...
- **Warly**: I seem to be developing a taste for danger.
- **Wormwood**: Makes big angry light
- **Winona**: If I'm gonna start somethin', I'd better be ready to finish it.
- **Wortox**: Hyuyuyu, this might get interesting!
- **Wurt**: Make big angry sparks in sky.
- **Walter**: We don't want anyone feeling left out, right Woby?
- **Wanda**: I'm not too keen on drawing unwanted attention.

## Scrapbook Info

Creates a flash in the sky that can be seen by all survivors on the minimap. This large flash will also draw the attention of some hostile creatures.

## Tips

- Players can use the Hostile Flare to fight Deerclops more than once per Winter season, with the goal to acquire more than one **Deerclops Eyeball**. This allows for crafting of several **Eyebrella** and **Houndius Shootius** without the need to wait for subsequent Winters.
- If the Hostile Flare is used to summon and kill Deerclops, it will reset its spawn timer of 71.8 days.

## Trivia

- The Hostile Flare was added as part of the **One For the Books** update.

## Bugs

- Currently, regardless of resetting the timer of Deerclops, it will still spawn on its designated day.

# Grainy Transmission (Wagstaff)

## Overview
The Grainy Transmission, also known as **Wagstaff**, is an NPC exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the **Return of Them**. He can be found in the **Moonstorms** that spawn after the **Mysterious Energy** is created. He reappears after the **Celestial Champion**'s final phase is defeated.

## Moonstorm Quest
Upon players entering a moonstorm for the first time, he will approach them and drop the blueprints for **Astroggles** and the **Lunar Siphonator (Incomplete Experiment)**. Wearing Astroggles will show an indicator on the edge of the screen pointing to Wagstaff's current location if he is nearby.

He will appear somewhere in the moonstorm and run a short distance before disappearing when approached. Once followed four times, he will appear with a machine with 100 health and trying to contain an energetic static. **Moonblind Crows** and **Misshapen Birds** will land in flocks and approach Wagstaff in an attempt to prevent the containment of the moonstorm energy. If the container takes over 100 damage the containment will fail and he will disappear requiring the player to track him down again. After the containing process succeeds, he will leave a **Restrained Static** and disappear.

Wagstaff will periodically ask for one of five tools, which will spawn around him during the containment process. Most characters will not be able to identify the tools, however **Winona** will be able to see the proper name when moused over the item. After the correct tool is given to Wagstaff, it will respawn nearby a few moments later. All tools will vanish when the containment process ends, regardless of outcome.

After defeating the **Celestial Champion**, he will show up to siphon its lunar energy with the **Lunar Essence Extractor** for two minutes (1/4 of a day). At this point, the player can show him the **Enlightened Shard** dropped by **Celestial Champion**. He will ask the player to give it to him, and doing so will cause **Rifts** to begin spawning. If Wagstaff vanishes before the player is able to do so, he will reappear somewhere around the player after some time, which gives the player another chance to give him the shard.

## Tools
### Reticulating Buffer
- **Quotes**: "That has to be the tool I'm looking for!" (Wilson)
- **Spawn Code**: "wagstaff_tool_1"

### Widget Deflubber
- **Quotes**: "Of course I know what it is! It's just, er... too complicated to explain." (Wilson)
- **Spawn Code**: "wagstaff_tool_2"

### Grommet Scriber
- **Quotes**: "Clearly a very scientific tool!" (Wilson)
- **Spawn Code**: "wagstaff_tool_3"

### Conceptual Scrubber
- **Quotes**: "My scientific instincts tell me that this is the tool I'm looking for!" (Wilson)
- **Spawn Code**: "wagstaff_tool_4"

### Calibrated Perceiver
- **Quotes**: "I know exactly what it does! Science!" (Wilson)
- **Spawn Code**: "wagstaff_tool_5"

## Lunar Essence Extractor
After the defeat of the **Celestial Champion**, Wagstaff appears near its remains with the **Lunar Essence Extractor**, which he uses to house energy taken from the Celestial Champion. The first time this happens and any subsequent times while the **Lunar Rifts** are not activated, Wagstaff asks players for an **Enlightened Shard** in order to activate the **Lunar Rifts**. A player must first show the shard to Wagstaff, and offer it to him afterwards. A message pops up warning the player and asking for confirmation. Once confirmed, **Lunar Rifts** are activated.

## Spark Ark Quest
If a lunar-mutated Boss (**Armored Bearger**, **Crystal Deerclops**, or **Possessed Varg**) is defeated, Wagstaff appears and requests the player to defeat more of them, in order for him to conduct his research. Once all three bosses have been defeated, Wagstaff rewards the player with a **Spark Ark**. Afterward, Wagstaff drops a Spark Ark for each boss defeated, but they must still be cycled through.

## W.A.R.B.I.S. Quest
Once **Lunar Rifts** have been activated, a first set of **Abandoned Junk** spawns in a random location after 4-7 days along with **Research Notes**. Wagstaff then periodically appears next to a player for

- Wanda: "If any intruders come by, they'll be in for a thorny surprise."

The **Bramble Trap** is a character-specific **Weapon** similar to the **Tooth Trap**, only available in the **Hamlet** DLC and **Don't Starve Together**. It is craftable by **Wormwood** from the **Green Thumb Tab** using a **Living Log** and a **Stinger**. It can be placed on the ground and deals 40 damage in a radius of one **Pitchfork** tile when it is stepped on by a **Mob**, also damaging **Walls**. This can damage the player, but the player will not activate it by stepping over it. The splash damage can be avoided by wearing a **Bramble Husk**, which will negate its damage without losing any durability. Like a Tooth Trap, it has 10 uses and must be reset after each use.

Bramble Trap damage will not aggro nearby mobs, nor will it increase a player's **Naughtiness**. Bramble Traps are also fireproof. A Bramble Trap can be picked up and placed elsewhere at any time, regardless of having been triggered or not.

**Mobs that will not activate Bramble Traps:**
- Batilisks
- Bees and Killer Bees
- Birds
- Butterflies
- Chester
- Dragonfly
- Glommer
- Gnat Swarms
- Lureplants (and their Eyeplants)
- Mosquitoes
- Mounted Beefalo
- Packim Baggims
- Poison Mosquitoes
- Shadow Creatures
- Vampire Bats

**Prototype Tips:**
- Although clustering these traps together can be dangerous, the player can avoid damage altogether from these by wearing a Bramble Husk. This makes farming large groups of enemies like Spiders simple and easy.

{{Quote|. . .|Wes}}
Wes is one of the two playable Characters that are not unlocked via Experience in Don't Starve and one of the 17 playable characters in Don't Starve Together (DST). He is a fragile French mime that uses pantomimes to communicate instead of speaking. Wes's purpose in the game is to provide a challenge to experienced players.

## Origin

{{Quote|Some people just seem to attract more than their fair share of bad luck... and even those people are grateful they aren't Wes.|Official description for ''C'est La Vie''}} 

Wes's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled [[Animated shorts and trailers#C'est La Vie|C'est La Vie]]. An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [[Compendium]]:

"Despite a life plagued by terrible luck, Wes has never been one to utter so much as a word of complaint. Rather than dwell on his own troubles, he has instead dedicated his life to making others smile... even if it's at his own expense."

"His journey to the Constant itself was nothing if not a tragic comedy of errors. After a series of snowballing missteps, Wes found himself accidentally taking the place of a stranger caught in the grip of a shadowy portal bound for the Constant. His unexpected arrival infuriated the Nightmare King, who quickly exacted his vengeance on the poor mime for interfering with his plans. Wes was banished to his own private prison, far from sight, where he would remain until he was rescued by the Constant's other Survivors (being the kind soul that he is, Wes holds no grudge against Maxwell... though he does continue to give him the silent treatment.)"

"Had Wes known what fate awaited him on his last day on Earth, he likely wouldn't have done anything differently. In truth, there is a part of him that is happy to be in the Constant with the other Survivors - for who could be in greater need of cheering up than those poor souls?"

According to the passport on the table at the girl's house and the box marked with the name in the lower right corner, the stranger who was replaced by Wes was [[Minor Characters#George T. Witherstone and daughter|George T. Witherstone]], the former creditor of William Carter.  This also explains why Maxwell angrily imprisoned Wes after he failed to retaliate.

## Unlocking

{{Quotes
|wilson = Maxwell's statues are trapping him.
...
|source = when examining Wes.
|choose = maxwell
}}[[File:Wes trapped.png|thumb|left|[[WX-78]] in an effort to rescue Wes.]]

In the third chapter of [[Adventure Mode]], a set piece may appear (if the map is not ''Two Worlds''), which will have two chambers with a [[Maxwell Statue]] in each one, and a third one with Wes in the middle.

When players break one of the statues, it will release various non-damaged [[Clockwork Monsters]]. After breaking all the statues and defeating the Clockwork Monsters, go to the chamber where Wes is trapped. More Bishops, Knights and Rooks will spawn and the player will need to defeat them.

After all monsters are cleared, Wes will pass out

# Moose (Goose)
The Moose, also known as Goose, is one of the four giants in **Reign of Giants**. Moose/Goose can appear 2–4 days into Spring if more than three base structures have been built relatively close to each other (Science Machine, Lightning Rod, Crock Pot, etc.). The giant will disappear when Summer arrives.

## Health and Damage
- Health: 3000 (6000 in Don't Starve Together)
- Damage to player: 75
- Damage to mobs: 150

## Attack Stats
- Attack Period: 3
- Attack Range: 5.5
- Walk Speed: 8
- Run Speed: 12
- Special Ability: Honks to make the player drop their weapon.

## Drops
- **Meat x6, Drumstick x2, Down Feather (3-5)**
- **Down Feather x3.66**
- **Sketch for Moose/Goose Figure**

## Behavior
If left alone for roughly 1 day after it arrives, a Moose/Goose Egg will spawn, which will hatch into 5 Moslings if hit with a hammer 4 times. Moslings won't grow into a Moose/Goose but when attacked, they will let out a cry, spawning another Moose/Goose. Note that a Frog Rain could potentially spawn another Moose/Goose if the Frogs attack the Moslings. When a Mosling is slain, all Moslings will become enraged and use a whirlwind attack that attracts Lightning to them, attempting to strike the player.

## Strategy
Moose/Goose will make a warning animation once it spots the player, becoming aggressive towards them. She will proceed to slowly hop towards the player. When in range, she will attempt to gore the player. After every third swipe, she will honk which is a disarming attack, knocking the player's weapon out of their hands. The attack can be avoided by unequipping the held item and re-equipping it.

### Tips
- In Don't Starve Together, players can put a Houndius Shootius on a Boat and anchor the boat offshore to kill the Moose/Goose without taking damage.
- It's possible to kill multiple Moose/Gooses easily if the player is near them and a frog rain is occurring, and letting the Frogs to attack the Moslings.

## Trivia
- The name is a tongue-in-cheek portmanteau of both "Moose" and "Goose".
- Moose/Goose is the only monster added in Reign of Giants which doesn't have an insanity aura.
- Moose/Goose is considered the biggest mob in Reign of Giants.
- Moose/Goose's lower body is based on a Canadian Goose.

# Abigail Lillian Carter

**Image**: ![]Abigail.png (80px)  
**Health**: 600  
**Damage**: 10 (Day) / 20 (Dusk) / 40 (Night)  
**Attack Period**: 1  
**Attack Range**: 3  
**Run Speed**: 5  
**Drops**: ![Abigail's Flower](Abigail_Flower_Closed.png)  
**Spawn Code**: "abigail"  
**Special Ability**: AoE attack. Cannot damage player or current allies.  
**Spawns From**: ![Abigail's Flower](Abigail_Flower.png)  

**Quotes**:  
- Wilson: "Awww, she has a cute little bow."  
- Willow: "So, what happened to you?"  
- Wolfgang: "Are you friendly ghost?"  
- Wendy: "That's my twin sister, Abigail."  
- WX-78: "UNDEAD ALERT"  
- Wickerbottom: "Fascinating. Can you speak, specter?"  
- Wigfrid: "What dö yöu desire, apparitiön?"  
- Woody: "That ain't right."  
- Maxwell: "Why won't these mortals just stay dead?"  
- Webber: "That's no party poltergeist!"  
- Warly: "Apparition!"  
- Wormwood: "Floaty Friend"  
- Winona: "How are you, boo?"  
- Wortox: "Poor soul."  
- Wurt: "You... nice?"  
- Walter: "Your sister kind of creeps me out, but you're alright!"  
- Wanda: "Poor thing. Her time came too soon."  
- Choose: Wendy

## Behavior

Abigail has a rapid area-of-effect attack that damages all enemies next to her. If she attacks pack mobs like Spiders or Beefalo, she can incite the whole group. Abigail can also damage Spider Dens, Beehives, and Killer Bee Hives. She does not attack any mobs that don't threaten her or Wendy first, except for neutral Pikos, Treeguards, and Fishermerms. If her target doesn't appear interested in her or Wendy or if Wendy moves far enough away, Abigail settles down after about two seconds of fighting.

Abigail follows Wendy everywhere, including Caves, but she keeps a minimum distance from her. Abigail can keep up with her as long as she stays off Roads and Cobblestones and doesn't use a Walking Cane. If they get too separated, Abigail teleports to just outside Wendy's sight.

Abigail cannot be frozen by the Ice Staff, and she cannot help Wendy fight Shadow Creatures or Ghosts. Abigail's kills do not count as Wendy's kills; as such, they do not increase her Naughtiness level.

## Tips

- If Wendy intentionally attacks Abigail using the force attack control, Abigail can be destroyed in one single hit, disappearing and leaving her flower on the ground. This can be used as a method to dismiss her at will.
- In Don't Starve Together, Abigail can be utilized alongside Wendy to deal bonus damage against boss mobs thanks to the vulnerability applied and Wendy's stronger attacks. This can prove useful to kill stronger foes rapidly if one (or more players) is fast to not let Abigail die, even though she will likely fall to very enduring bosses such as Deerclops and Bearger.
- Abigail can effectively stun-lock a group of Spiders while taking very little damage herself. Wendy should use her sister's support to her advantage when attacking a Spider Den; though the player should be aware of the fact that such stuns are ineffective on Spider Warriors.
- Using Abigail is a safe way to murder Butterflies. Since Abigail's kills do not increase Wendy's Naughtiness, it won't spawn Krampus. In the Shipwrecked DLC, the same applies to Abigail killing Jellyfish, which won't summon Floaty Boaty Knights.
- It takes almost 10 minutes for Abigail to regenerate from 1 HP to her full 600 HP.
- Crows and other flying birds flee before Abigail can attack. Rabbits, on the other hand, can be outrun by Abigail, though it takes her multiple hits to kill a rabbit in daylight.
- When hunting a Koalefant, Abigail can draw out the animal's aggression. When Wendy engages an attack, Abigail attacks too, likely getting the first hit. This makes it unnecessary to craft a ranged weapon or chase the animal into a corner when Abigail is available.
- Abigail will protect Wendy from aggressive Bees that come out after harassing a Beehive or gathering Honey from a Bee Box. Bees in the area of effect are easily stun

# Snazzy Pitchfork

**Equip Slot:** hands  
**Icon:** Snazzy Pitchfork.png  
**Image:** Snazzy Pitchfork Dropped.png  
**Tier:** 2  
**Filter:** ![Tools Filter](Pic32)  
**Ingredients:**  
- Twigs x4  
- Gold Nugget x2  
**Durability:** 800 uses (Dig Turf)  
**Damage:** 17  
**Stack:** Does not stack  
**Spawn Code:** "goldenpitchfork"  
**Perk:** Digs up Turfs.  
**Description:** Rearrange the whole world.

**Quotes:**  
- Wilson: Why did I even make a pitchfork this fancy?  
- Willow: It won't light the ground on fire, but at least it's shiny.  
- Wolfgang: Fancy pitchfork good for stab ground.  
- Wendy: One might as well till fields with style.  
- WX-78: GOLD IS *MORE* DURABLE?  
- Wickerbottom: The most malleable of metals, but let's see how this tills.  
- Woody: Welp. I can't unmake it, so...  
- Maxwell: I'm not sure this was a good investment.  
- Wigfrid: A weapon of very wealthy farmers.  
- Webber: We can do some fancy forking with this.  
- Warly: A golden fork for a giant, oui?  
- Wormwood: Pretty Ground Getter  
- Winona: I mean why not, hey?  
- Wortox: Fancy mob gear. Hyuyu!  
- Wurt: For fancy farming, florp.  
- Walter: Now I can be part of a FANCY angry mob.  
- Wanda: I wouldn't want that gold to go to waste.  
- Choose: Wilson

The Snazzy Pitchfork is a variant of the normal [[Pitchfork]] that has four times as much durability and requires Gold instead of Flint, allowing Flint to be saved for other uses. It requires 2 Gold Nuggets and 4 Twigs to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Snazzy Pitchfork has 800 uses, 4 times as many as the normal Pitchfork.

### Usage
Once the Pitchfork is equipped, a square outline will appear on the ground showing the patch that the cursor is hovering over, along with a prompt. Right-clicking will dig up the outlined terrain, leaving a barren patch in its place. Turf items can only be placed on this sort of barren terrain.

The Pitchfork has 200 uses (800 for snazzy pitchfork), which means that each time it digs up a turf, it will lose 0.5% durability. It can also be used as a weapon which deals 17 damage but suffers higher durability loss per hit (4%).

In Don't Starve, a Turf's instant availability and decent fuel value, coupled with the Pitchfork's high durability and speed, makes Turfs one of the easiest options for fueling Campfires and Fire Pits. Turfs are not renewable, however. In Don't Starve Together, Turfs have a significantly lower burn time (7.5s instead of 45s), making it a weak method for fueling, although it can be used in the same way as Pine Cones in that the player will likely have an excess of them for no other purpose than fuel.

Dug up Turf can be replaced with other kinds of Turfs (e.g. Wooden Flooring). This is useful for decoration or for preventing Lureplants and Eyeplants from spawning.

The digging animation for the Pitchfork can be cut short by moving after the player digs up anything. This speeds up the process of mass-clearing turf when holding spacebar.

### Skins
In Don't Starve Together, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the Belongings page.

# Belt of Hunger

## Overview
The Belt of Hunger is a wearable Magic item in the game. It requires 6 Slurper Pelts, 2 Rope, and 2 Nightmare Fuel to craft and a Shadow Manipulator to prototype. The Sewing Kit repairs 63% of its durability.

## Details
- **Icon**: Belt of Hunger.png
- **Image**: Belt of Hunger Dropped.png
- **Repaired by Sewing**: 1
- **Ingredients**:
  - Slurper Pelt (multiplier: 6)
  - Rope (multiplier: 2)
  - Nightmare Fuel (multiplier: 2)
- **Filter**: Clothing Filter, Magic Filter
- **Tier**: 3
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Sanity Drain**: +2/minute
- **Spawn Code**: "armorslurper"
- **Perk**: Reduces hunger loss by 40%. Restores sanity over time.
- **Description**: Keep that belly full.
- **Wears Out**: 8 days

## Quotes
- Wilson: A soggy, sustaining, succulent suit.
- Willow: Oh, ick! Ick! Ick! Ick! Eeeeeewwwwww!
- Wolfgang: It moves with my many muscles!
- Wendy: A clinging, dreary, living suit.
- WX78: FURRY INSULATION FOR MY WIRES.
- Wickerbottom: A disgusting and magical garment.
- Woodie: It tickles. I think it's still alive.
- Maxwell: Wet, soggy, and oddly filling.
- Wagstaff: This dark fuel could truly solve the world's hunger problems.
- Wigfrid: She ebbs the ache of hunger. Good fur.
- Webber: Squeeze our tummy tight!
- Walani: So efficient!
- Warly: Ah. My appetite wanes under its protection.
- Woodlegs: How bad do I wanna protect myself?
- Wilba: MAKETH WILBA HAIRY AND SAFE
- Wormwood: Furry belt. Looks good
- Wheeler: It'll be all the rage in Paris.
- Winona: So tight I barely remember the gnawing hunger!
- Wortox: If it means I eat less often, count me in!
- Wurt: Good belt, glorp.
- Walter: The smell kind of ruins my appetite.
- Wanda: I guess I'll swallow my pride and wear it...
- Choose: Winona

## Tips
- Because Slurpers do not respawn without resetting the ruins by killing the Ancient Fuelweaver, it's recommended to use the Sewing Kit on the Belt of Hunger to repair it rather than letting it degrade and crafting a new one.
- A single use of the Sewing Kit restores enough durability to prevent 151 points worth of hunger drain, comparable to Meaty Stew. This makes sewing a Belt of Hunger an extremely efficient way to prevent starvation.
- The Belt of Hunger is very useful for Wigfrid and Wes, due to the former's inability to eat non-Meaty foods and the latter's decreased maximum Hunger.

# Scorpeon

**Hostile Enemy Mob from "The Forge" event exclusive to "Don't Starve Together"**

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Scorpeon |
| **Image** | ![Venomeer](Venomeer.png) |
| **Health** | 3400 |
| **Special Ability** | Uses splash acid attacks in melee. |
| **Spawns From** | ![Forge Portal](File:Forge Portal.png) |
| **Spawn Code** | "peghook" |
| **Damage** | 70 (without armor) |

## Quotes

- Wilson: That spit is corrosive!
- Willow: It's got a weaponized butt!
- Wolfgang: Wolfgang will beat you with fists!
- Wendy: Abigail will defend me.
- WX78: ITS ACID CORRODES METAL
- Wickerbottom: A sentient Scorpiones. How odd.
- Woodie: That acid'll be a problem, eh?
- Maxwell: I should like to avoid a pinch from that, I think.
- Wigfrid: Yöu will be felled this day.
- Webber: Wouldn't you rather be bug friends with us?
- Winona: That acid stuff burns!

## Acid

The Scorpeon's Acid mechanic is specific to "The Forge" and functions similarly to Poison in other Don't Starve DLCs. When hit by an Acid stream, a player's health will continually drop over time until the effects wear off or they enter a Life Blossom field, which negates the Acid effects.

Scorpeons' Acid is the only attack in The Forge that ignores armor, making it dangerous to players, especially Maxwell. A full Acid damage can reach up to 66 Hp, nearly the entirety of Maxwell's health gauge and around half of the other characters'.

## Tips

- Learn the Scorpeons' attack pattern to anticipate their moves and avoid their acid.
- Use ranged weapons to avoid getting near them.
- Abigail, being a ghost, is immune to Scorpeons' Acid, allowing her to tank hits for players. Bernie is susceptible.
- Gather Scorpeons in a cluster and use the Infernal Staff's Call Cataclysm to deal massive damage.
- Count to 3 when a Scorpeon starts to spew acid; the first two attacks are normal, so let it hit you, then go behind its back for the third attack to avoid acid.

## Trivia

- The Scorpeon's spawn code is "peghook", but it's impossible to spawn Scorpeons in the regular game on "The Forge" servers.
- According to "Rhymes With Play" #162, WX-78 is affected by Scorpeon's Acid because it is acidic, not poisonous.
- The Scorpeon was originally called Venomeer, then Scorpeon, Scourgion, and then reverted back to Scorpeon.
- Its ranged poisoning attack was renamed from "Venomeer Venom" to "Scorpeon Acid" to reflect its nature, and character examination quotes were modified accordingly.

## Behavior

MacTusk is an aggressive Mob that spawns from Walrus Camps during Winter. Upon death, he drops 1 Meat, 1 Blow Dart, 1 Walrus Tusk (50% chance), & 1 Tam o' Shanter (25% chance). He attacks with a Blow Dart (which has a longer range but deals less damage), while trying to keep his distance. One can dodge his darts with correct timing; using a Walking Cane or Roads will raise their chances.

They're only active during daytime and, if not engaged, will return to their igloo at dusk. However, they can be forced out by attacking the sleeping Hounds. Although the Walrus Camp emits light at dark, the Hounds will attack anyone close by.

The group, being hostile towards almost any Mob, follows a nearby target; if one keeps walking away, they will not attack. When the leader, MacTusk, becomes hostile, he makes a slashing gesture, he then shoots and pursues the target, while Wee MacTusk commands the Hounds to attack. Both walruses will flee when approached.

Should MacTusk and Wee MacTusk die, the Hounds will attack freely until they respawn. If the Hounds are killed but MacTusk survives, he will come out the next day. Dead members respawn in 2.5 days.

## Hunting

A simple way to distract the party is to use Chester as bait, by placing him between MacTusk and the player. This makes it much easier to kill both Hounds.

Recruiting Pigs or even a single Pig is another option. With the Hounds engaged, one can hunt down MacTusk personally.

An Ice Staff or Sleep Dart is more effective with a strong melee weapon; alternatively, MacTusk can be killed with 2 Blow Darts. As he always drops a Blow Dart, this would only cost a net of 1 Dart(s).

The party can also be chased or led into other Mobs (e.g. Merms, Pengulls, Tentacles ect.), or into Tooth Traps.

## Tips

- MacTusk can be chased towards his igloo to block his path; he can then be stun-locked and taken out with a melee weapon.
- MacTusk can be stun-locked while doing the battle cry animation.
- One can use a combo of Ice Staff and a weapon on MacTusk.
- It is possible to construct a MacTusk drop farm using at least 4 Pig Houses. Stone Walls can be used to keep them closer to each other, allowing easy access to the non-food drops. It also makes basing near the Walrus Camp more beneficial.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "These are pretty snazzy."
- Willow: "The ground is boring."
- Wolfgang: "Step stones."
- Wendy: "Some ground."
- WX-78: "MARBLE GROUND"
- Wickerbottom: "The ground. You step on it."
- Woodie: "Looks like one of those city-people outhouses."

- Wilba: "‘TIS GROUND"
- Wormwood: "Not dirt"
- Wheeler: "Do I really need to drag this floor around with me?"
- Choose: Woodie

**Checkerboard Flooring** is a craftable **Turf Item**. It requires 1 **Marble** to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as **fuel**.

Checkerboard Flooring spawns around the **Wooden Thing**, in the **Chess** biome, and in various **Set Pieces**.

**Eyeplants** cannot spawn on Checkerboard Flooring, making it an expensive and artificial way of protecting oneself from **Lureplants**. Plants like **Berry Bushes**, **Grass Tufts**, **Saplings**, **Spiky Bushes**, **Pine Cones**, and **Birchnut**s can't be planted on these turfs, unless they were planted before the turfs were placed.

When placed on the **Surface World** in a large enough area, Crows are the only **Birds** that will spawn and land on Checkerboard Flooring.

Caution is advised when looking for this type of Turf, as the Clockwork Monsters can provide a challenge to unprepared players that are attempting to collect it.

In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, this Turf will not spawn **Puddles**. Expanding Puddles can still flood this Turf, however.

## Trivia
* Checkerboard Flooring was added in the **A Little Rain Must Fall** update.
* Despite being crafted from Marble, it can be used as fuel like the other Turfs.
* When walking on Checkerboard Flooring, a distinct ambient sound can be heard, similar to the one near an assembled **Wooden Thing**.

# Life Giving Amulet

## Overview
- **Equip Slot:** Body
- **Image:** ![Life Giving Amulet](Life Giving Amulet Dropped.png)
- **Icon:** ![Icon](Life Giving Amulet.png)
- **Scrapbook Description:** A Ghost that haunts this amulet will be revived.
- **Tier:** 4
- **Tab:** Magic
- **Ingredients:**
  - 3 Gold Nuggets
  - 2 Nightmare Fuel
  - 1 Red Gem
- **Dropped By:**
  - Grave
  - Ancient Pseudoscience Station
  - Shipwrecked DLC: Slot Machine, Trawl Net
- **Sold By:**
  - Hamlet DLC: The Flying Pig Arcane Shop (50 Oincs)

## Stats
- **Perk:** Converts Hunger to Health. Resurrects the player on death and puts nearby mobs to sleep.
- **Sanity Drain:** +2/min
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Durability:** 20 uses (Healing), 1 use (Resurrecting)
- **Spawn Code:** "amulet"

## Description
- The Life Giving Amulet is a craftable item found in the Magic tab. It requires 3 Gold Nuggets, 2 Nightmare Fuel, and 1 Red Gem to craft and a Prestihatitator to prototype. It can also be found when a Grave is dug up, it can randomly drop from a Slot Machine or be dropped by an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when it is damaged with a Hammer, Gunpowder, etc.

## Resurrection Effects
- Health is set to 50
- Hunger is set to 2/3 of maximum
- Sanity is set to 1/2 of maximum
- Empty inventory (items can be found at place of death)

## Additional Information
- When hurt, the Life Giving Amulet will recover 5 HP at the cost of 5 Hunger every 30 seconds when it is worn until fully healed. This reduces the durability of the item by 5% every time the trade-off happens, so it is possible for the amulet to break without reviving the player.
- Equipped amulets also restore +2 Sanity per minute with no effect on durability.

## Downloadable Content
- In the Shipwrecked DLC, Life Giving Amulets also function as a Life Jacket and save the player from drowning in the Ocean when their boat sinks.
- In the Hamlet DLC, Life Giving Amulets can be bought for 50 Oincs at The Flying Pig Arcane Shop in the Pig City.

## Tips
- All bosses and some enemies, such as the Ancient Guardian and Clockwork Bishop are immune to the sleep effect, so the player may get attacked and die again. It is better to flee from these fights when the player is not in a favorable position.
- Should the player die, resurrection will occur regardless of how much durability is left, as long as it's above zero. So there is no reason to not use the Amulet to heal wounds until it reaches 5% durability.
- This item is especially useful when playing as Maxwell. Because of his low maximum Health, Meat Effigies are not recommended, leaving only the Amulet as a way of resurrecting the player when Touch Stones are not available. The amulet also is useful for healing after using the Codex Umbra.

## Trivia
- The Life Giving Amulet was added in The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You update.
- The Life Giving Amulet used to be called just "Amulet" before other amulets, such as the Nightmare Amulet, were added. It lost its old texture when it became the Life Giving Amulet, which was similar to the one used for the now defunct Gemology crafting tab.
- Before the Strange New Powers update, these amulets could be stacked. As a result of this change, any stacks of amulets previously stored in chests were turned into just one amulet.
- Before the Strange New Powers update, they required twice the amount of materials to craft.
- In Don't Starve Together, Klaus uses the older version of the Life Giving Amulet to revive himself.
- The Life Giving Amulet shares the same in-game model with the Construction Amulet, but its gem is red instead of green.
- Ironically, though this amulet resurrects the dead, it can still be found in graves.
- This item could be a reference to the Amulet of Life Saving from NetHack.

# The Lazy Explorer

## Overview
The Lazy Explorer is a craftable item found in the Ancient Tab. It requires 2 Nightmare Fuel, 1 Walking Cane, 2 Orange Gems, and for the player to be near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. It can also randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when damaged and has a 25% chance to be found inside a Large Ornate Chest.

## Usage
When equipped in the hand slot, a prompt to "Telepoof" appears where the cursor is on the field, and right-clicking will almost immediately teleport the character to that spot. The Lazy Explorer also increases movement speed by 25% while equipped, same as the Walking Cane. Telepoofing will not work on spots where the cursor is unavailable, such as the Ocean or in the dark. With each use, characters will lose 15 sanity and The Lazy Explorer will lose 5% of its durability.

Since Orange Gems are not renewable in the base game, only a limited number of Lazy Explorers can be crafted.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, players also have a 0.02% chance of finding Orange Gems inside Tumbleweeds, thus making Lazy Explorers renewable. In the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, players also have a chance to find the Lazy Explorer in the hidden rooms behind Suspicious Cracks in Ancient Pig Ruins.

## Tips
- It is a good idea to equip a Construction Amulet when crafting The Lazy Explorer, and save on the rare Orange Gems.
- Like all items that can be equipped in the hand slot, The Lazy Explorer can also be used as a weapon. Attacking with it does 10 damage, considerably less than the Walking Cane which does 17.
- It is advised not to have the staff equipped while planting, or performing any other activity that involves right-clicking. The default right-click option is to cast the telepoof spell, resulting in wasted durability if the mouse is clicked in an unacceptable spot.
- One can stack the speed bonus with the Magiluminescence to have a total increase of 45% movement speed while both items are worn, which means that while on a Road, characters will have a terrific 75% speed boost.
- This can be faster with WX-78's "SYSTEM OVERLOAD" or Wormwood's Bloom ability.
- When teleporting across gaps, any followers the player had at the moment (including Chester) will teleport off-screen near your location.

## Trivia
- Before it was added to the game with The Stuff of Nightmares update, the Lazy Explorer's casting was the same as the other Ancient Staves.
- Wendy's quote ("Each time I use it I die and am reborn.") is related to the theory about teleportation that, if a human being were to teleport, their body's atoms would be deconstructed and replaced elsewhere, essentially killing and then recreating the person in question.

## Bugs
- Teleporting across gaps may cause the player to land off the map.
- Occasionally if the player teleports too quickly, the sound effect of swinging will be played, however the rod will not swing, and the player will also not teleport. This can be fixed by walking a short distance.

## Scrapbook Info
Can be added to Crock Pot food using a Portable Seasoning Station.  
Eating a dish spiced with Seasoning Salt grants 25% more healing for healing effects.  
Duration 4 minutes.

## Crafting
Seasoning Salt is an **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. They can only be crafted by **Warly** in the **Seasonings Filter** using three **Salt Crystal** rocks at the **Portable Grinding Mill**.

## Usage
Seasoning Salt can be added to **Crock Pot** dishes in a **Portable Seasoning Station** for a 25% boost to their healing effects. Dishes seasoned with Seasoning Salt gain the adjective **Salty** before their names.

### Example Recipe
- **Item 1**: Meatballs
- **Item 2**: Seasoning Salt
- **Tool**: Portable Seasoning Station
- **Result**: Salty Meatballs

## Tips
- Seasoning salt can be used to counteract some of Warly's food benefit penalty. Pierogi can be seasoned with salt to heal 50 **Hp**; as he eats more, salted pierogi will heal 45, 40, 32.5, 25, and finally 15 **Hp**.
- Seasoning Salt does not affect the secondary healing effects of food like **Jellybeans**, so use other Seasonings or leave them unseasoned.

## Trivia
- Seasoning Salt was introduced in the **Salty Dog** update.
- While it was part of the **Return of Them** beta branch, Seasoning Salt was called Salt Crystals. It was later renamed to help differentiate it from the resource.

# Rhinocebro Snapback and Rhinocebro Flatbrim

## Mob Infobox
- **Box title**: Rhinocebro Snapback and Rhinocebro Flatbrim
- **Image**: ![Rhinocebros](Rhinocebros.png)
- **Image width**: 400px
- **Health**: ~12750
- **Damage**: 150 (Increases by 25 after every buff)
- **Spawn from**: ![Forge Portal](Pic32)
- **Spawn code**: Cannot be spawned
- **Special ability**: Calls out to each other to receive buff in attack. Stacks buff after each consecutive, complete call. Revives fallen brother very quickly. Regroup back to each other to call out to each other or to revive.

- **Willow**: Pfft. Whatever Rhinocebros.
- **Wolfgang**: Wolfgang is more macho.
- **Wendy**: Brotherly camaraderie will not save you.
- **WX-78**: YOU CORRUPT THAT MACHINE ON YOUR HORN!
- **Wickerbottom**: Prone to unnecessary displays of masculinity.
- **Woodie**: They really like bumping chests like that, eh?

- **Choose**: Wickerbottom|Wurt=They not so tough, flort!|Wortox=Is that double I do see?|Wormwood=Aww... bro love|Walter=He's got a nose for this kind of work.|Warly=Can't we just talk?

The Rhinocebro Snapback and the Rhinocebro Flatbrim are mobs exclusive to The Forge event in Don't Starve Together. They appear after the Grand Forge Boarrior and its accompanying wave have been defeated.

## Behavior
The Rhinocebros, after being summoned from the opposite sides, appear to buff each other by calling out to each other to deal greater damage at any time; whenever they do this, they quickly attempt to regroup to each other, this is also more powerful than the Life Blossom's effects, making them able to get off their hits before sleeping again. The damage buff gained by their battle cries is permanent, lasting through the rest of the round, and can stack with any subsequent buffs. However, it is possible to interrupt their battle cries by stunning them via chucking Lucy as Woodie, or with the special attacks of most weapons. Should one Rhinocebro get his buff interrupted, the other one will stop buffing as well.

## Tips
- Due to the Rhinocebros being able to revive each other, the strategy of a runner distracting one Rhinocebro while the rest of the team focuses fire on the other will not work. Instead, near-equal damage should be applied to both of them at the same time.
- An individual Rhinocebro's appearance will signal about how much damage it has taken, with a big, cartoonish bruise/rash appearing on its face, missing teeth, and a bent horn signalling it has reached a health threshold.
- It is important to stop the Rhinocebros from using their battle cries, as its damage buff is permanent and can stack.

## Trivia
- The Rhinocebro Snapback and the Rhinocebro Flatbrim's spawn codes are "rhinodrill1" and "rhinodrill2", respectively.
- The Rhinocebros are named after two different types of baseball hats.
- The Rhinocebros, if treating both brothers as their own, separate mob, are two of the three of the new mobs introduced in the 2018 version of The Forge, the third being the Infernal Swineclops.

When used, the Pugalisk Wand generates hypnotic rays that freeze all **Mobs** hit by it, similar to one of the **Pugalisk**'s attacks. The range and direction of the four projectiles can be directed using the mouse. The freezing effect of Pugalisk Wand is 5 times that of an **Ice Staff**.

Unlike most held items, the Pugalisk Wand has no durability and instead rots after four minutes in a way similar to the **Ham Bat**. There is no difference in its effectiveness depending on its duration remaining, and it can be used an infinite number of times for the duration. Once it rots fully, it will return one **Bone Shards**.

## Tips
- One can bundle it in a **Bundling Wrap** to make it stop rotting.

## Trivia
- Pugalisk Wand was added in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet#Version History|Aporkalypse** update.

| Item | Base Cost | Cost with amulet | Net Cost | Net Savings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deconstruction Staff | 2x Green Gem, 2x Living Log, 4x Nightmare Fuel | 1.2x Green Gem, 0.4x Thulecite, 1x Living Log, 2.6x Nightmare Fuel | 0.4x Thulecite | 0.8x Green Gem, 1x Living Log, 1.4x Nightmare Fuel |

## Tips
Since Green Gems are so rare, the best use for Construction Amulets is to craft items that require very rare or non-renewable materials (i.e., items from the Ancient Tab).

## Trivia
The Construction Amulet shares the same in-game model with the Life Giving Amulet but its gem is green instead of red.

## Bugs
When left with only 20% durability remaining (its last use), the Amulet's effect will only partially work. The amulet will properly allow the player to completely build something with only the first half of its normal material cost. However, it will erroneously cause the second half of the cost to be consumed as well, if the player has the materials.

# Hound's Tooth

The Hound's Tooth is a resource obtained by killing Hounds, Red Hounds, and Blue Hounds. Hound Mounds, once destroyed, will also drop three Hound's Teeth. This item can be used to craft a Dapper Vest, Blow Dart, Sewing Kit, and Tooth Trap.

## Obtaining Hound's Teeth

Aside from waiting for periodic Hound attacks, the only way to acquire Hounds' Teeth is by visiting a Walrus Camp (in Winter) or a Hound Mound and fighting the Hounds and Blue Hounds that spawn. This can be extremely dangerous and should not be attempted unless adequately prepared.

### Downloadable Content

- **Reign of Giants DLC**: Hound's Teeth can sometimes also be obtained by destroying Tumbleweed and hammering Bones. Another method to get Hound's Teeth is to track and kill a Varg. The player can find a Varg by tracking down a Koalefant. However, tracking a Varg can be difficult as there is only a 5% chance on day 1, which increases over time to 33% chance on day 100.
- **Shipwrecked DLC**: Crocodog and Sea Hound also have a chance to drop Hound's Teeth. Crocodogs replace Hounds during periodic attacks, they will follow the player both on land and on the Ocean. Sea Hound attacks can be triggered when Meat or Fish items are dropped on the water. They can also spawn after Fishing in a Shoal.
- **Hamlet DLC**: Hound's Teeth can be bought for 5 Oincs each at The Sty' Oddities Emporium in the Pig City. They also have a chance to drop from Hammered Smashing Pots.

## Usage

### Recipes

- **Dapper Vest**: Requires 8 Hound's Teeth and 6 Silk.
- **Tooth Trap**: Requires 1 Hound's Tooth, 1 Rope, and 1 Log.
- **Blow Dart**: Requires 1 Hound's Tooth, 1 Azure Feather, and 2 Cut Reeds.
- **Sewing Kit**: Requires 2 Hound's Teeth, 8 Silk, and 1 Log.
- **Shark Tooth Crown** (Shipwrecked): Requires 5 Hound's Teeth and 1 Gold Nugget.
- **Oinc** (Hamlet): Requires 1 Hound's Tooth to produce 5 Oincs.

### Tips

A player can farm Hound's Teeth by trapping a Varg in a walled enclosure (ideally Stone Walls, since Red Hounds cannot set them on fire). It will attract endless Hounds, which can be dispatched with a nearby array of Tooth Traps. The Hounds will be attracted by Monster Meat. Lure one into the traps using yourself as bait and it will drop Monster Meat, baiting the rest of the Hounds into the traps as well. The dropped Hound's Teeth can be used to replenish the Tooth Traps, making the farm largely self-sufficient. It's recommended to only farm for Hound's Teeth in Winter and Spring, as Blue Hounds are guaranteed to drop two Hound's Teeth, whereas a Red Hound will only drop one.

## Trivia

According to Wickerbottom, Hound's Teeth contain brimstone, also known as sulfur. In folklore, sulfur is often associated with demons, implying that the in-game Hounds are Hellhounds.

## Description
Butterfly Wings are a food item dropped by killing Butterflies. They are a very reliable drop (98%), although there is a small chance of getting Butter instead (2%). Eating Butterfly Wings will restore 8 Health, the same as a Spider Gland, and a little bit of Hunger. They can be used to create Butter Muffins in a Crock Pot. Butterfly Wings can be easily farmed by setting up a Butterfly Farm, with Beefalo in heat, Hounds, or even Catcoons in RoG.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Butterfly Wings can be acquired by destroying Tumbleweeds. Doing this will not provoke Krampus. Butterfly Wings can also be given to Catcoons to befriend them.

In the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC, Butterfly Wings take on a blue appearance as do the tropical Butterflies they drop from.

## Usage
- **Glossamer Saddle**: Requires 2 Living Logs, 4 Silk, and 68 Butterfly Wings.
- **Manure**: Requires Butterfly Wings.
- **Butter Muffin**: Requires Butterfly Wings, Vegetables, and Filler (Filler can't be Meats or Mandrake).

## Tips
- Butterfly Wings are a good healing item during early game and in a pinch. They provide the same amount of healing as Spider Glands do. However, Butterfly Wings can be obtained easier, and with less risk. On the other hand, unlike Spider Glands, Butterfly Wings spoil over time, and are difficult to obtain during the Night or Winter. While the Spider Glands can be used to make Healing Salves, Butterfly Wings can be used to make Butter Muffins to heal the same amount of additional hit points, however the latter requires a Crock Pot.
- Even though it is dropped by an animal, it is not considered meat. This means it cannot be eaten by Wigfrid, but can be eaten by Wurt (this is probably due to the fact that butterflies are flying flowers and therefore a plant-based food).

## Scrapbook Info
Catch fish in ponds.

## Usage
Ponds can be found in any part of the map, but they are most common in Marshes, Forests, and Grasslands. To begin fishing, drag and drop the Fishing Rod on the pond or equip the rod and click the pond, and the character will cast a line into the pond. After 5–40 seconds, the line will tug and the "Hook" option will appear. Clicking the left mouse button on the pond will hook the fish, and an additional click will reel it in.

If the player does not reel the fish in shortly after "Reel in" appears after "Hook", the fish will escape and the Fishing Rod will be lost. The player can stop fishing any time by walking away or clicking the pond again.

The time required for the fish to bite depends on the amount of fish remaining in the pond. It will require a minimum of 5 seconds when the pond has maximum amount of fish. As more fish are caught, the time will increase to 5 + 35 * (percentage of the pond fished). For example, if half of the fish in a pond are caught, the next fish will take 22.5 seconds to bite. Fish respawn in ponds over time. After the last fish has been caught, any fishing attempts started before a new fish spawns will never catch a fish. In other words, there must be at least one fish remaining when the fishing is started for any fish to be caught.

The Lake at the Oasis can also be fished, yielding Fish or Crumpled Packages which contain Trinkets and rare Blueprints.

## The Gorge
In the Gorge event, Fishing Rods can be bought from Billy for 3 Old Coins each. They are used to catch Salmon from Salt Ponds. Unlike in normal gameplay, Fishing Rods in the Gorge do not have a limited durability and can be used an infinite amount of times.

## Tips
- When trying to fish in surface ponds, dangerous creatures will be present depending on the time of day. Grasslands Ponds will spawn Frogs during the day time, while Marsh Ponds will spawn Mosquitos during dusk and night.

## Bugs
- Sometimes a glitch occurs where the fishing hooks ends up in the ground instead of the pond, depending on the direction the player is facing and proximity to the
