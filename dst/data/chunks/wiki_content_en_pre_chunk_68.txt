# Shadow Puppet

![Shadow Puppet](Shadow_Puppet.png){: width="100px"}

**Health:** 75  
**Damage:** 40  
**Attack Period:** 2  
**Attack Range:**  
**Run Speed:** 6  
**Spawn Code:** "shadowwaxwell"  
**Name:** Shadow Puppet  
**Special Ability:** Helps with chores and fights

## Description
Shadow Puppets are shadow versions of [Maxwell] that do his bidding. While the puppets are active, they will aid Maxwell in combat as well as also aiding him in cutting trees and mining rocks. However, they have low health and will die quickly in combat against more able foes. Shadow Puppets will automatically die 2.5 days after their creation. Upon its death, the player gains back the 55 max sanity from the puppet.

## Downloadable Content
In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, Shadow Puppets summon shadow **Row Boats** to follow Maxwell into the **Ocean**. The Shadow Puppets act as though they are sailing, yet the boats do not have **Sails** and have the same speed as a normal Row Boat. Shadow boats can only be driven by shadow puppets, and disappear when the puppet exits the boat. It is possible to enter a shadow Row Boat when not being used by a Shadow Puppet, by quickly entering it before it disappears. However, doing so results in a crash. Shadow Puppets will help **hack** things.

## Trivia
- The footsteps of the puppets make a faint warping sound.
- Despite being Shadow Creatures, passive animals will avoid puppets and neutral mobs will fight back against them. Puppets are also unable to help the player against Shadow Creatures.
- The description "Diggy diggy hole" is a reference to the song "[Diggy Diggy hole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytWz0qVvBZ0&ab_channel=YOGSCASTLewis%26Simon)" by the Youtube channel Yogscast.

# Resting Horror

The **Resting Horror** is a passive creature exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**. It appears in the **Ruins** on one of the **Relic Chairs**.

## Behavior
The Resting Horror appears sleeping on one of the Relic Chairs in the Ruins. It is only visible to players below a certain sanity threshold, can only be attacked by insane players, and cannot be examined. 

The Resting Horror is **Shadow Aligned**.

When killed, the Resting Horror drops 1 **Nightmare Fuel** and a **Blueprint** for the **Replica Relic Chair**. It respawns after 2 in-game days and sits on a different Relic Chair.

### Rift
If **Shadow Rift** exist, the Resting Horror drops **Pure Horror** instead of **Nightmare Fuel**. Additionally, it has **Planar Entity Protection**. However, due to its low health, this is rarely relevant aside from the effect when hitting it, as it dies in one hit from almost every regular attack.

## Trivia
- The Resting Horror was introduced in the **From Beyond#Terrors Below** update.
- In the **From Beyond#Host of Horrors** Beta Update 576473, the Shadow Rift requirement for the Resting Horror to appear was removed, and a new look without the red Pure Horror shading was added.[Klei Forums - Game Update 576473](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/151621-game-update-576473/)

## Examples

- **Item 1**: Berries
- **Item 2**: Berries
- **Item 3**: Berries
- **Item 4**: Berries
- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Fist Full of Jam

### Example 2

- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Fist Full of Jam
- **Note**: A recipe that allows Wurt to convert meat into edible food (feed the meat to a Bird first).

## Bugs
- Fist Full of Jam does not exclude Fish items. Shipwrecked DLC introduces food items that have fish values without any meat value, such as Fish Morsel and Jellyfish. This causes using up to 2 Fish Morsels or using a single Jellyfish in a recipe with Fruits to produce Fist Full of Jam despite containing meat.

## Tips
- Making Fruit Medley is a more efficient use of Durian Fruit by adding a stick instead of a fourth fruit, getting much more healing, more sanity, and slightly more hunger return per fruit.
  - You can put 3 berries and a Durian fruit to get this item, which results in the same hunger and health bonus as just the berries (roasted), but slower rot time and 5 sanity added.

# Spider Den

## Overview
A **Spider Den** is a nest in which [[Spider]]s and [[Spider Warriors]] spawn and live. Spiders emerge in search of food at [[Dusk]] and return to their Dens at dawn. The number of Spiders that live in a Den varies depending on its size (''see table below''). When a Den reaches its final stage, it evolves into a [[Spider Queen]]. Spider Dens are surrounded by a creep-like substance called Sticky Webbing, which slows down anything caught in it, aside from Spiders. Sticky Webbing will grow on any surface except a small area around a [[Rabbit Hole]].

## Characteristics

## Growth Cycle

A Spider Den has 3 growth stages: 5–10 days in Tier 1, 5–10 days in Tier 2, and 12.5–25 days in Tier 3. Tier 3 Dens will evolve into a Spider Queen after they hit the next stage and the player has been nearby for 60 to 120 seconds. When a Spider Queen spawns, she leaves behind a Tier 1 Den nearby if there are less than 3 other Dens or Spider Queens in 60 radius (15 Terrain Tiles). This new Tier 1 Den will grow into a Tier 2 Den in sixty seconds real time. After wandering to a new location, the Queen will settle down, transforming back into a Tier 1 Den.

| Den Size | Next Stage | Spiders | Released (Webbing) | Released When hit | Health | Loot |

The **Masked Pig** is a **Mob** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, which can only be found in a Pig Town and its surrounding area. As his clothing suggests, this Mob is a thief and will immediately become aggressive toward the player upon spawning if there is at least one **Oinc** in their inventory.

## Behavior
If Oincs are present in the player's inventory, the Masked Pig will start to follow the player, stopping occasionally like a spy would to avoid notice (a specific tune will be played at that moment). Once close enough to the player, he will charge and attempt to hit the player.

If the Masked Pig manages to land a hit, any type of Oincs in the player's inventory will be dropped individually on the ground. Each fallen Oinc will then have to be picked up one by one quickly, as the Masked Pig or any nearby **Royal Guard** will begin to steal them. Landing a hit on the Masked Pig will distract him from picking up coins and cause him to flee.

Generally, if attacked, the Masked Pig will immediately jump backwards to dodge subsequent attacks, then flee. Its running speed is higher than the player's running speed, which make it difficult to catch up to it. After about 10 seconds without being hit, the Masked Pig will use a smoke bomb to vanish, taking any stolen Oincs with it.

## Quotes
### Attacking
- "HAVE AT THEE"
- "TAKE FROM THE RICH!"
- "ENGUARD!"

## Tips
- A useful method for killing the enemy is to use **Blow Darts** gathered after **disarming** dart traps in the ruins. Three successful hits will take it out.
- Another useful method to beat the Masked Pig is to trap him into a group of Royal Guard members. It will be difficult for this Mob to dodge every attack, and once it has been hit once, this fight can alert other Pigs who will come to help.
- Care should be taken if the Guards kill the Masked Pig with Torches as the Swashy Hat will burn by default. Nevertheless, the **Bandit Stash Map** has a good probability to not burn if picked up before the fire spreads to it.
  - If one is only willing to loot the Bandit Stash Map, the player can simply attack the Masked Pig with a torch, and it will run back and forth in panic like most **mobs**. It is very easy for the player to kill such a target, as any mob in such a state won't attack the player as often or run in a straight opposite direction.
- A Masked Pig won't search for Oincs in the chests or backpacks.

# Florist

## Exclusivity
Hamlet

## Behavior

- Woodlegs: 'Tis swine, fer sure.
- Wilba: Wilba liketh thy hat

- Wheeler: Personally, my interests go beyond flower petals, but to each their own.

### Behavior
One Florist may spawn from a Town House, and will wander randomly around their house and eat any edible items left on the ground, including Pig Skin. Every so often they will drop one Manure where they are standing, and if the player picks up that manure the Florist will approach them and give them one Oinc, along with an accompanying Quote.

Whenever there is a hostile mob nearby, or a player targets them or another Pig Trader or Royal Guard near them, they will enter a panicked state. They will begin to move around semi-randomly in a direction away from the aggressor.

They will attempt to return to their house in the evening, and if they cannot reach their house or their house is destroyed they will seek the nearest light source and stand next to it until night, when they will sleep on the ground.

# Aporkalypse Calendar

![Aporkalypse Calendar](Aporkalypse%20Calendar.png)

The **Aporkalypse Calendar** is a naturally occurring structure that can be found behind a Suspicious Crack in the **Ancient Pig Ruins** on the 5th island. It can be used to avoid or get closer to the **Aporkalypse**.

## Description

The Calendar resembles a clock with a tellurion in the middle, made of three rings moving at varying speeds. All three rings have a sigil on them. To the left and right of the clock are two pressure plates that fast forward and reverse the clock respectively.

### Quotes

- **Wilson**: Looks scientifically apocalyptic.
- **Willow**: Looks ominous. I like it.
- **Wolfgang**: Is clock of scary things.
- **Wendy**: Clockwork for the end of times.
- **WX-78**: MY ANCIENT BRETHREN
- **Wickerbottom**: Ah. Quite a complex form of clockwork.
- **Woodie**: Looks like it's the end of days.
- **Maxwell**: I do like this...
- **Wagstaff**: Wonderful! I wonder if I could make the world end sooner.
- **Wigfrid**: It controls Ragnarök!
- **Webber**: It's like a puzzle!
- **Walani**: I hate clocks.
- **Warly**: Like the knobs on a stove, it must be turned just right.
- **Woodlegs**: The time be nigh!
- **Wilba**: TIME AND THE HOUR RUNS THROUGH IT
- **Wormwood**: Tic Tock
- **Wheeler**: If only I could turn time back to before I crashed here.

## Mechanics

- When all three sigils on the rings align, the Aporkalypse is triggered. This must happen with time passing normally, as using the pressure plates will make the rings move too fast to trigger the Aporkalypse.
- The inner ring completes a full lap in 30 days, or 240 minutes.
- The middle ring completes a full lap in 1 day, or 8 minutes.
- The outer ring completes a full lap in 60 days, or 480 minutes.

## Tips

- To access the 'fifth island,' the player will need to traverse the **Gas Rainforest** biome to search for the ruins with the **Ancient Herald** carved above the entrance.
- Sometimes **Scorpions** will spawn in the Aporkalypse Calendar room.
- To avoid the Aporkalypse for the longest time possible, set the Aporkalypse Calendar just after all three sections are aligned.
- Many **Pig Traders** and **Pig Guards** will warn the player about something terrible happening, indicating the Aporkalypse is near.

## Console

- If one's command console is enabled, the command `GetAporkalypse().begin_date = GetClock():GetTotalTime()+28800` will reset the Aporkalypse timer. `GetAporkalypse():EndAporkalypse()` will end the Aporkalypse.

## Trivia

- The Aporkalypse Calendar may be based on the real-life [Mayan Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_calendar), which was believed to cause cataclysmic events when it ended on the 21st of December 2012.
- The Aporkalypse Calendar was added in the **Aporkalypse** update.

# Waterlogged

## Official Description
Left adrift at sea in the sweltering heat, our Survivors thought they were surely done for. And perhaps they would have been if luck hadn’t landed them beneath the protective boughs of an enormous tree. A tree that, remarkably, seemed to spring from the ocean itself. Believing themselves to be saved, the Survivors began collecting the bounty of fruit and materials the great tree had to offer, not realizing that they were not the only ones to have found safe harbor beneath the canopy..

# Hound Mounds

### Overview
Hound Mounds are naturally spawning objects found in both Sandbox Mode and Adventure Mode, with a higher likelihood in the latter. They house up to 3 Hounds which spawn every 5 seconds until the mound is empty. Hounds killed will gradually regenerate at a rate of 1 every 30 seconds.

### Attributes
- **Health**: 300
- **Resources**: 3x Hound's Tooth, 1% Red Gem, 1% Blue Gem, 2x Bone Shards
- **Spawns**: Hound, Red Hound, Blue Hound
- **Renew**: No
- **Biome**: Rockyland, Forest, Desert
- **Spawn Code**: "houndmound"

### Quotes
- **Wolfgang**: "Is house of bones."
- **Wilson**: "I've got no bones to pick with the owner. Really."
- **Willow**: "Uh oh, I don't like the look of that."
- **Woodie**: "I know better than to mess with that."
- **Maxwell**: "It's a tunnel down to the hounds' nest."
- **Wagstaff**: "Are there hounds hiding within it?"
- **Wendy**: "Home to the foulest creatures."
- **Woodlegs**: "Th'ounds be livin' thar."
- **Wickerbottom**: "Those bones are foreboding."
- **Webber**: "This place scares us."
- **Warly**: "It smells wet."
- **WX78**: "SOMETHING DANGEROUS RESIDES HERE"
- **Walani**: "I think there are some angry pups lurking nearby."
- **Wigfrid**: "These höunds are truly warriörs."
- **Wilba**: "'TIS HILL O' HOUND"
- **Wortox**: "It's the dog house!"
- **Wormwood**: "Woofers around?"
- **Wurt**: "Found doggy nest, florp."
- **Wheeler**: "Typical. Dogs never clean up after themselves."
- **Winona**: "So that's where they're comin' from."
- **Walter**: "I bet there's something interesting hiding in there!"
- **Wanda**: "Ugh, a dwelling made of old bones!"

### Spawn Behavior
When hit, all hounds housed in the mound will spawn and attack the player. The chance for each guard hound to be a special hound (Red Hound or Blue Hound) increases as the days pass, capping at 50% on day 75.

| Day Range | Special Hound Spawn Chance |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| 1-14      | 0%                       |
| 15-29     | 10%                      |
| 30-49     | 20%                      |
| 50-74     | 33%                      |
| 75+       | 50%                      |

### Additional Information
- Hound Mounds can be found commonly in the Desert Biome, often in clusters. When destroyed, they drop 2 Bone Shards in addition to regular loot.
- The mounds now house between 2-3 hounds and have a 20% chance to spawn a Red Hound instead of a regular hound during Summer. The chance to spawn Blue Hounds extends into Spring, and the chance to spawn Red Hounds extends into Autumn.
- Hounds spawn from mounds in 30-second intervals, and killed hounds regenerate at a rate of 1 every 2 minutes.
- Hound Mounds regenerate killed hounds at a rate of 1 every 3 minutes.

### Tips
- Hounds spawned from Hound Mound will not continue to chase players if they are far away from the mound. Instead, they will bark for a moment and then return to the nest.
- Players should be careful when trying to lure a Deerclops or a Spider Queen to a Hound Mound, as the Hounds may kill the player before attacking the giants.
- Players can use Hound Mounds to farm Red Gems from the Red Hounds that have a 20% chance of spawning from the mounds during Summer. Blue Gems only spawn from Blue Hounds, which will only have a chance of spawning when the mound is attacked.
- Hound Mounds can be destroyed by the fires spawned by Red Hounds.

### Trivia
- Hound Mounds were added in the "A Little Rain Must Fall" update.
- Hound Mounds will continue to spawn Hounds even if the player is playing on a world with Hounds

2. Monster Meats + Twigs + Honey (x2)

- Kabobs is best made when the player has an abundance of meat, time, and perhaps Crock Pots, as well as the need to stretch filler ingredients.

## Trivia

- Another spelling for "Kabobs" is "Kebabs".

## Scrapbook Info
I sure hope no one opens it, or worse, corrupts it.

The **Terrarium** is an item exclusive to **Don't Starve Together** and introduced in the **An Eye for An Eye** update. It can be found in a **Conspicuous Chest** that randomly spawns in a **Forest**. It is used to summon the **Eye of Terror** boss, which is done by dropping it on the ground, touching it, and waiting until nightfall (or touching it at night).

It can be corrupted with a single **Nightmare Fuel**, which will cause the contained plant to take on a withered appearance (similar to the **Crimson** biome's trees in Terraria). If it is active at night, the Terrarium will instead summon the **Twins of Terror**.

If the Eye of Terror or Twins of Terror are defeated, or a night is skipped after summoning the Twins of Terror at least once, the Terrarium enters a dormant state. In this state, it cannot be touched to activate it, and thus cannot be used to summon the boss(es). This state lasts for 15 days with default world settings.

The Terrarium will sink in the water. However, it will return to the coast.

Upon entering the **Caves**, the Terrarium will be dropped at the players' feet.

## Trivia
- When activated, it releases a gentle ringing closely matching the first few seconds of the Overworld Day track from **Terraria**.
- The appearance of the Terrarium and the beam it fires resemble the **Last Prism** from **Terraria**.

## Description
Pig Heads are decorative structures usually found around [[Touch Stones]], [[Rundown Houses]], and [[Merm]] villages. They are the severed heads of [[Pigs]] on sticks, similar to [[Merm Head]]s, the latter being often found in [[Pig Village]]s.

Destroying a Pig Head with a [[Hammer]] drops 2 [[Pig Skin]] and 2 [[Twigs]]. This is a good way to get Pig Skin early in the game. Deconstructing a Pig Head with a [[Deconstruction Staff]] drops 4 Pig Skin and 4 Twigs, although it cannot be constructed.

During a [[Full Moon]], the Pig Head's eyes will open and become pure white, similar to a [[Catcoon]] or [[Buzzard]]'s eyes. Destroying a Pig Head during this time yields an extra [[Nightmare Fuel]]. A burnt Pig Head will drop 1 Pig Skin, 1 Twig and 50% chance for a [[Charcoal]] when destroyed by a Hammer.

## Trivia
- Pig Heads were added in the [[Version History#Doorway to Adventure|Doorway to Adventure]] update.
- Pig Heads can be found around the Merm camps, and Merm Heads can be found around the Pig Villages. This suggests that there is a war between Pigs and Merms, or at least hostility.
- The way the Pig Heads glow during a Full Moon looks similar to the way they were shown to glow when using a Touch Stone in one of the update trailers.
- Wilson's and Wendy's quotes are both direct references to the novel [[Lord of the Flies]] by William Golding.
- Initially, there was only one pig's head next to the [[Touch Stone]]. At the same time, it glowed only after activating the [[Touch Stone]].
- There are black tears coming from the pig's head.

- This is further reinforced by the fact that there is a symbol on the bottom, and that the item is shaped like the animal, with the bump forming a "snout" and "whiskers" and purple gems forming the "eyes."

## Description
Cactus Flesh is a Vegetable Food Item from the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC. It can be harvested from Cactus at the cost of 6 HP. Eating it raw will cost the player 5 Sanity and 3 Health.

Cactus Flesh can be used as an ingredient in many Crock Pot recipes, but only Guacamole requires it specifically.

Feeding Cactus Flesh to Pigs will result in them producing Manure.

Depending on what type it is, wearing Armor while harvesting a cactus can reduce damage down to 1 HP. Since Cooked Cactus Flesh heals this amount, one can negate the harvesting damage entirely.

Since Cacti are unaffected by cold during Winter, one can easily harvest Cactus Flesh and eat it cooked to regain Sanity lost from the long nights, or used in lieu of farmed vegetables in Crock Pot recipes. Cactus is easily renewable in the Desert biomes which makes it a good base location.

## Cooked Cactus Flesh
- **Quotes:** Described in the Quotes section above.

Cooked Cactus Flesh is acquired by cooking Cactus Flesh on a Campfire, Fire Pit, or Star. It restores the same Hunger as its raw form, but does not hurt the player's Health and restores 15 Sanity instead.

## Usage
### Cooking
- **Item:** Cactus Flesh
- **Result:** Cooked Cactus Flesh
- **Tool:** Cooking

### Pig
- **Item:** Cactus Flesh
- **Result:** Manure
- **Tool:** Pig

### Crock Pot
- **Item1:** Cactus Flesh
- **Item2:** Moleworm
- **Item3 & Item4:** Filler (cannot be Fruit)
- **Result:** Guacamole
- **Tool:** Crock Pot

## Usage
The Spark Ark is an item in *Don't Starve Together*, introduced in *From Beyond*. It resembles the head of an *Ancient Sentrypede*.

The first Spark Ark is given to the player by *Wagstaff* after three lunar-mutated bosses are defeated: *Crystal Deerclops*, *Armored Bearger*, *Possessed Varg*.

Subsequent Spark Arks can be acquired by defeating only one of the bosses mentioned above; however, players must still cycle through the mutations. To receive a Spark Ark from a boss, it must not be a part of the current cycle; the cycle must be completed by having defeated both of the other ones. It is possible to earn a reward for defeating the same boss twice in a row if said boss was the final one of the three that was killed, as the progress is completely reset for each cycle.

To be used in crafting, the Spark Ark must be filled with energy at the activated *Ancient Archive*. When placed on the floor, the Ark absorbs the *Security Pulse* from the *Ancient Guard Post*.

The full Spark Ark can be used to craft the *Polar Bearger Bin*, *Ice Crystaleyezer*, and *Howlitzer* at the *Brightsmithy*.

### Crafting Recipes
#### Polar Bearger Bin
- **Tool**: Brightsmithy
- **Ingredients**: Spark Ark, Thick Fur, 3 Pure Brilliance, 5 Moon Rock
- **Result**: Polar Bearger Bin

#### Ice Crystaleyezer Kit
- **Tool**: Brightsmithy
- **Ingredients**: Spark Ark, 8 Moon Shard, 3 Pure Brilliance, 5 Moon Rock
- **Result**: Ice Crystaleyezer Kit

#### Howlitzer
- **Tool**: Brightsmithy
- **Ingredients**: Spark Ark, 3 Brightshade Husk, 3 Pure Brilliance, 3 Moon Rock
- **Result**: Howlitzer

Fishermerms are passive Mobs found in Marsh biomes in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. They spawn from Fishermerm's Huts in Merm Villages. Unlike Merms, they are passive creatures and will not attack the player even if provoked. They periodically fish out Tropical Fish at Tidal Pools, though they do not eat what they catch and simply leave it on the ground. When spotting a player they will run away in random directions in the opposite direction of the player.

## Description

Jungle Burrs are seeds dropped by Rainforest Trees in the Hamlet DLC during the Lush Season when the Rainforest Trees bloom and Strong Winds blow, or the trees are chopped down. Burrs can be planted to grow into a new tree. They cannot be planted on Rocky Turf, Wooden Flooring, Stone Road Turf, Flat Stone Turf, Lawn Turf, and Cultivated Turf.

If a Jungle Burr is planted in the Gas Rainforest Biome, it will grow a rotten version of Rainforest Tree instead of a normal one.

At the end of the Lush Season, when a Jungle Burr is being carried in the inventory, it will fall out and automatically plant itself within 0-0.5 days (if the turf is suitable for planting) where one is standing. This can also occur when it is dropped on the ground within 0-0.5 days. However, if there are more than 3 Rainforest Trees (including the burnt ones but not stumps) or too many obstacles around the Jungle Burr, it is dropped on turfs (including indoor floor) that cannot be planted, or it is floating on the water, it will just disappear within 0-0.5 days.

# Glommer's Statue

![Glommer's Statue](File:Glommer's Statue.png)

**Glommer's Statue** is a unique structure found in the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC. It can be found in the Deciduous Forest biome. When mined, it drops three marble blocks. Mining the statue does not completely destroy it.

- **Spawns:** {{pic|32|Glommer}}
- **Tool:** Can be [[Tools#Mining Tools|Mined]] {{pic|32|Pickaxe}}
- **Renew:** Cannot be destroyed
- **Biome:** [[Deciduous Forest]]
- **Picked:** Can be picked ({{pic|32|Glommer's Flower}}) During [[Moon Cycle|Full Moon]]
- **Resources:** {{pic32|Marble}} ×3
- **Spawn Code:** "statueglommer"

On a full moon, a [[Glommer's Flower]] will spawn at the base of Glommer's Statue (even if it has been mined). Picking up Glommer's Flower will cause [[Glommer]] to become a permanent "follower" (until Glommer dies). After mining the statue, the base will remain, allowing Glommer and Glommer's Flower to respawn at a full moon. The statue has a 75% chance to spawn near a [[Pan Flute]].

Glommer's Flower can only be picked once per full moon, on either night. If a player picks it on the first night of the full moon, and then Glommer dies before the following night, they cannot pick it again the second night - they must wait until the next full moon. If a player picked the flower the "previous" full moon and Glommer dies on either day, the flower can still be picked that night. 

There seems to be a high chance that Glommer's Statue will spawn next to a [[Pig King]] village, which might make collecting Glommer's Flower difficult due to [[Werepig]]s.

A Pan Flute will always generate alongside Glommer's Statue. It will not regenerate if consumed.

## Quotes

- **Wilson:** "I'm not sure what that's supposed to be."
- **Willow:** "Is that supposed to be something?"
- **Wolfgang:** "Why statue is not flying?"
- **Wendy:** "What IS that?!"
- **WX-78:** "STONE INSECT"
- **Wickerbottom:** "Is it petrified?"
- **Woodie:** "That's a curious statue, eh?"
- **Maxwell:** "Hey, that's not a statue of me!"
- **DST:** "Thank goodness, I thought it was another wretched statue of me."
- **Wagstaff:** "Something in the stone must cultivate the flower."
- **Wigfrid:** "A curiöus hömage tö the göds."
- **Webber:** "A statue of some weird bug."
- **Walani:** "All messed up now."
- **Warly:** "Must have been a pretty important, uh, thingy..."
- **Woodlegs:** "Ugly statue."

### Usage

Pig Skin can be obtained by killing a Pig, Werepig, or Guardian Pig, or by deconstructing a Pig House with a Hammer or Deconstruction Staff or Pig Head with a Hammer. It is used to craft several items, such as the Football Helmet and Umbrella. Pig Skin is a "horrible" meat food item, which means that while the player refuses to eat it, Spiders and Pigs will see Pig Skin as food and will eat it if left on the ground. Additionally, it can be fed to Pigs to befriend them.

Pig Skin is required in two more recipes: Scalemail and Summer Frest. Also, although Webber is half Spider, he still finds Pig Skins inedible.

# Bananas

## Raw Cave Banana
- **Can Be Burned:** Yes
- **Image:** Cave Banana Dropped.png
- **Icon:** Cave Banana.png
- **HP Restored:** 1
- **Hunger Restored:** 12.5
- **Food Type:** Veggie
- **Sanity Restored:** 0
- **Spoil Time:** 10 Days
- **Food Value:** Fruit × 1
- **Spawn Code:** "cave_banana"
- **Stack:** 40
- **Dropped By:** Splumonkey, Cave Banana Tree (x1 when unpicked), Monkey Totem (x2), Banana Bush

## Cooked Banana
- **Can Be Burned:** Yes
- **Name:** Cooked Banana
- **Image:** Cooked Cave Banana Dropped.png
- **Icon:** Cooked Cave Banana.png
- **HP Restored:** 3
- **Hunger Restored:** 12.5 (27.5 with Wormwood)
- **Sanity Restored:** 0
- **Food Type:** Veggie
- **Spoil Time:** 6 Days
- **Food Value:** Fruit × 1
- **Stack:** 40
- **Spawn Code:** "cave_banana_cooked"

Bananas are Food Items found on Banana Bushes on the Moon Quay and Cave Banana Trees found in Caves and Ruins. Splumonkeys drop 1 Banana on death and are more likely to follow and steal from a player carrying any number of Bananas. Bananas can be given to the Queen of Moon Quay in exchange for rare Blueprints or removing Accursed Trinkets. Bananas are Wonkey's favorite food, and thus consuming it as them will restore an extra 15 Hunger.

## Cooked Banana
Cooked Bananas are the product of cooking a Banana over a Campfire, Fire Pit, or Star. Like most fruits and vegetables, cooking increases the Health bonus slightly while decreasing the spoil time. Cooked Banana is Wormwood's favorite food and thus consuming it as him will also restore extra 15 Hunger.

### Usage
- **Cooking Recipe:** Cave Banana → Cooked Cave Banana (using Fire Pit)
- **Manure Recipe:** Cave Bananas → Manure
- **Monkeytails Tuft Dug Recipe:** Cave Banana + 4 Cut Reeds → Monkeytails Tuft Dug (Wormwood)
- **Frozen Banana Daiquiri Recipe:** Cave Bananas + Ice + Filler + Filler (using Crock Pot, Filler cannot be Twigs)
- **Banana Shake Recipe:** Cave Bananas + Cave Bananas + Filler + Filler (using Crock Pot)
- **Banana Pop Recipe:** Banana + Ice + Twigs + Filler (using Pot, Filler cannot be Meats or Fishes)

### Trivia
- The raw image for the Banana shows multiple bananas in one bunch, but the Cooked image shows only three, which seem to be poorly prepared. This could hint to poor cooking/preparation due to abnormal food.
- Wickerbottom's quote mentions that all of the bananas are genetically identical. This is probably a reference to the concern from botanists over the increase in cloned banana trees which could theoretically make them infertile. This could also be the reason Cave Banana Trees cannot be grown by the player.
- The Cave Banana name is possibly a play on one of the most common banana cultivars, Cavendish Bananas.
- Since this is one of the few items that can be examined by Wilbur and they are available in Don't Starve Together, this makes Bananas, Banana Pop, and the Cave Banana Trees the items with the highest amount of player examinations.

# Pumpkin Cookie

## Structure Infobox
- **Can Be Burned**: Yes

- **Spoil**: 10 Days

## Quotes
- Wilson: "That's a pretty gourd cookie!"
- Willow: "Cookies!!!"
- Wolfgang: "Is tasty cookie."
- Wendy: "A... cookie..."
- WX-78: "I HAVE FLATTENED THE SHAPE"
- Wickerbottom: "Pumpkin biscuits, goody!"
- Woody: "This will keep me chopping."
- Maxwell: "It's been eons since I had a good biscuit."
- Wagstaff: "What a delightful recipe!"

- Wurt: "THIS THE BEST KIND OF PUM-KIN."
- Walter: "It's made from a vegetable, so it's healthy."
- Wanda: "I can never turn down a cookie."

## Recipe
A Pumpkin Cookie is a Food item cooked in a Crock Pot by combining 1 Pumpkin and 2 Honey (or Honeycombs). It takes 40 seconds to cook.

### Variations
- Using 3 Honey or Honeycombs may result in Taffy instead.
- Adding 1 Mandrake may result in Mandrake Soup.

Pumpkin Cookies restore the same amount of Sanity as Taffy but lose hunger over its own ingredients, restoring the same hunger as a raw or cooked pumpkin while lacking the small health boost from either.

## Cookbook Recipe
| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Pumpkin | 1     |
| Sweetener | 2.0  |
| Filler  | 1     |

## Crock Pot Examples
### Example 1
| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Pumpkin | 1     |
| Honey  | 2     |
| Twigs  | 1     |

### Example 2
| Item       | Count |
|------------|-------|
| Pumpkin    | 1     |
| Honeycomb | 2     |

### Example 3
| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Pumpkin | 1     |
| Honey  | 3     |

**Note**: 50% chance to produce Taffy.

### Example 4
| Item    | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Pumpkin | 1     |
| Sweetener | 2    |
| Mandrake | 1    |

**Note**: 50% chance to produce Mandrake Soup.

## Tips
- Practically, eating a Cooked Pumpkin alongside Taffy is more beneficial than eating Pumpkin Cookies. Since a Cooked Pumpkin restores 8 HP, it effectively cancels Taffy's Health penalty as well as restoring some Health back, while restoring more Hunger than a Pumpkin Cookie.
- With 1 Pumpkin, 3 Honey, and 1 Twig, the Player can restore a total of 5 HP, 62.5 Hunger, and 15 Sanity from 1 Taffy and 1 Cooked Pumpkin, compared to 3 HP, 47 Hunger, and 15 Sanity from 1 Pumpkin Cookie and 1 Honey.
- However, if your honey reserves are running very low, then Pumpkin Cookies do provide more sanity per unit of honey, 15 Sanity per two honey vs Taffy's 15 Sanity per three honey.
- It is inadvisable to use this recipe as a sanity source, as the sanity gain is the same as a single cooked green cap while costing at least 18.75 Hunger

# Set Pieces

Set pieces are rare, naturally spawned structures and items in all game modes. They were introduced in the Doorway to Adventure update. Players can usually find valuable items in the set piece. However, some set pieces function as a trap, forcing players to either bear the risk or disable the trap if possible. On some occasions, the player will have to retrieve the items from the set piece in order to escape the danger.

Players may also find Skeletons lying around, oftentimes with items surrounding them. These are called Failed Survivors. Unlike other Set Pieces, they are never traps. A key way to tell the difference is that Failed Survivors lack structures, floors, walls, etc. Be aware that it is possible to find skeleton and set pieces combined. The spawn frequency of Failed Survivors can be adjusted in the World Customization screen.

**Note:** The names of most set pieces are unofficial; they are nicknames invented by the Don't Starve community.

## Don't Starve

### Contagious Rot Trap

There are three variations of this set piece, all containing many pieces of Rot which are lying around. One version of the set piece contains a Backpack, two Ropes, two Rot, Straw Hat and a Straw Roll. If the player opens a Chest or a Backpack from the set piece, all food in the player's inventory will spoil.

However, the player can avoid this by dropping all perishable items away from the trap and then opening the Chest or picking up the Backpack, though this method may be problematic if there are Pigs or any other kind of Mobs nearby that might eat the dropped food. If the set piece contains a Chest, there will be a large amount of Rot and perhaps Blueprints. This set piece can be found in Sandbox Mode.

### Imprisoned Pig

The Pig Trap set piece can be found in Adventure Mode, Sandbox Mode, and Don't Starve Together. It consists of Basalt on three sides, and Obelisks on the other, with a Pig House in the middle. Players can use the Imprisoned Pig Set Piece in which Basalt spawns to trap any kind of mob, even giants in the Reign of Giants DLC, and hold them prisoner there without fearing their escape. An easy way to trap them is craft a Telelocator Focus inside the "prison" and then use the Telelocator Staff on the desired mob.

### Crock Pot Camp

This set piece is a camp found in Adventure Mode. It's usually enclosed by both Hay and Wood Walls. It has Wooden Flooring and some Rocky Turf, a Crock Pot, and a Bee Box or an empty Birdcage nearby. Several Skeletons are within the camp.

### Disused Beefalo Pen Trap

The disused Beefalo pen trap can be found in Sandbox Mode, Don't Starve Together, and Adventure Mode. It's usually located in a Savanna Biome and consists of a long Wood Wall fencing that curls around a squarish piece of land. Inside the fence are several Bones and Beefalo Wool, conveying the idea of an old Beefalo pen. There is a Chest at the entrance, which contains 1 Fire Staff, 4 Gunpowder, and 4 Logs.

Everything inside the fence can be taken. However, the Chest is trapped and will catch on fire when it's opened. The fire will cause the Gunpowder to explode, light the entire wooden fencing, and destroy the contents of the Chest. A way to prevent burning is to Hammer the nearby wood walls until they're destroyed. You can also extinguish the fire when the chest explodes. The fence can also manually be set on fire using Torch - providing a large amount of Ashes. This will not set the Chest on fire - but will also not disable its explosive trap. Hammering the Chest itself can trigger the trap.

All items can be taken from the Chest before the trap explodes, provided the player is fast enough. There is also a 34% chance for it to be a dud.

### Fire Staff Trap

This set piece consists of a Fire Staff surrounded by sleeping Red Hounds. Once the staff is retrieved, all Red Hounds will awake, causing the player to lose a large amount of sanity, and it will begin to rain.

The most efficient way to deal with this is to kill the Red Hounds before retrieving the staff, as each can be fought individually without fear of waking the others.

In Don't Starve Together, this set piece can also spawn in the Caves. This (and the one below) is the only way to have hounds legitimately in the Caves. This setpiece can be used with the Bee Queen Crown and pushing the sleeping Hounds close together to passively regenerate close to 200 sanity/minute.

### Ice Staff Trap

An Ice Staff trap, similar to the Fire Staff trap, is an Ice Staff surrounded by five sleeping Blue Hounds. Once the

   - A recipe for Dragon Pie that drastically extenuates hunger value.
2. **Dragon Fruits (x1)** + **Berries (x3)** = Dragon Pie
3. **Dragon Fruits (x1)** + **Durians (x2)** + **Twigs (x1)** = Dragon Pie
4. **Dragon Fruits (x1)** + **Eggplants (x2)** + **Berries (x1)** = Dragon Pie  
   - 50% chance to make Stuffed Eggplant
5. **Dragon Fruits (x1)** + **Ice (x3)** = Dragon Pie

## Tips
- Dragonpie heals more Health and Hunger than most of its ingredients. Due to this, and the rarity of Dragon Fruits, it is best to cook Dragonpies rather than eating Dragon Fruits on their own.
- In the Hamlet DLC, it is best to completely avoid buying Dragonpie from The Sterling Trough Deli, as it is nearly twice as expensive as meals such as Honey Ham which have similar stats.
- Because Wurt will not eat meat, Dragonpies are a fairly decent substitute to Honey Ham, Beefy Greens, and Bacon and Eggs, as they have a fairly identical statline of large hunger and decent healing. Dragonpie also boasts an impressive 15-day spoilage time, which can be considerably useful.

## Trivia
During the Pig Fiesta event in Hamlet, Dragonpie takes on a more festive appearance.

Puffins were added in 'Return of Them' and behave identically to other Birds, but will only spawn on the Ocean. They fly down from off-screen and peck the ground for a few moments, then fly away. When they take flight, there is a chance that Seeds are left behind, unless it's Winter. Birds will also be attracted to Seeds left on the ground. If the player or most other mobs get too close, birds will be frightened away. Birds won't land on Sticky Webbing and will swiftly fly away if they already lands.

When killed, birds drop a Morsel or a Feather, and all other birds nearby will fly away. They are considered innocent creatures and killing

## Description
Bioluminescence is a passive immobile [[Mob]] introduced in the ''[[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]]'' DLC. It is found in [[Ocean#Shipwrecked|Deep Oceans]] in groups of 12. It can be considered the aquatic version of [[Fireflies]], and emits light during the [[night]]. It will not appear until dusk arrives, and will stay until dawn. It does however still persist during a [[Full Moon]]. Once found, it can be caught with [[Trawl Net]] or [[Net]] while it is visible. Unlike Fireflies, it won't disappear when player character approaches, so they can be used as a permanent protection against [[Charlie]].

Bioluminescence can be used to craft [[Bottle Lantern]]s, [[Buoy]]s, and can be used to refuel Bottle Lanterns, [[Miner Hat]]s as well as [[Boat Lantern]]s (restores 38.5% of its capacity). It does not change location so once the map is generated, its location can be marked on the [[map]] by placing any items that have a map icon, such as [[Backpack]], [[Log Raft]], [[Raft]] or placing a Buoy nearby.

When dropped on land, Bioluminescence is destroyed, but it can be placed in the water safely.

### Usage
#### Bottle Lantern Recipe
- **Item 1:** Bioluminescence (2)
- **Item 2:** Empty Bottle
- **Tool:** Alchemy Engine
- **Result:** Bottle Lantern

#### Buoy Recipe
- **Item 1:** Bioluminescence (2)
- **Item 2:** Empty Bottle
- **Item 3:** Bamboo (4)
- **Tool:** Science Machine
- **Result:** Buoy

### Trivia
- Bioluminescence typically refers to the production of light by living organisms. Given the appearance and habitat of the Bioluminescence in-game, it appears to be modelled after [[Wikipedia:Dinoflagellate|Dinoflagellates]], which are bioluminescent Plankton that can cause water to glow in a phenomenon known as [[Wikipedia:Red Tide|Red Tide]].
- Before Bioluminescence was made obtainable through trading with the Yarrctopus, it could only be made renewable with a [[Construction Amulet]] and a [[Deconstruction Staff]] by first using the amulet to craft a Bottle Lantern (or Buoy), and then
