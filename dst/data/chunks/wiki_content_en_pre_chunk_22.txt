**Lawn Decorations** are structures exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, spawning naturally in the **Pig City** Biome. They come in seven different variations, some more abundant than others.

The Lawn Decorations can be destroyed with a **Hammer**, however they do not get fully removed. They can be repaired again by the player using a Hammer, or by a nearby **Worker Pig**. To fully remove a Lawn Decoration, one must obtain the **Executive Hammer** from the **Palace**.

If the player obtains the **Key to the City**, all seven variations become craftable in the **City Planning Tab** requiring 10 **Oincs** each.

### Trivia
- The Lawn Decorations can also be crafted using 1 **Oinc|Tenpiece Oincs** or 1 **Centapiece Oinc**. If using Centapiece Oinc, one will be returned 9 Tenpiece Oincs.
- The crafting description is a reference to a famous Bob Ross quote "Happy Little Trees".

## Description
The Clever Disguise is a character-specific Hat Item exclusive to Wurt in Don't Starve Together. It is crafted in the Clothing Filter and Survivor Items Filter using one Freshwater Fish, one Cut Reeds, and two Twigs.

Wearing the Clever Disguise allows a player to be considered a Merm by other Merms, King of the Merms, and Bunnymen (allowing Webber and Wortox to not be attacked on sight by Bunnymen). It allows taming Merms (not Loyal Merm Guards) and filling some Wurt structures such as Communal Kelp Dish, Armermry, and Shoddy Tool Shed.

## Trivia
- The Clever Disguise was introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Wurt Character Update.
- Much like its counterpart for Webber in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, the Shamlet Mask, the design of the Clever Disguise appears to be based on Groucho glasses.

# Beefalo Hat

## Overview
The Beefalo Hat is a Hat Item found in the Clothing Filter and Winter Items Filter. It requires 8 Beefalo Wool and a Beefalo Horn to craft, and a Science Machine to prototype. The Sewing Kit repairs 50% of its durability.

## Details
- **Slot**: Head

- **Filter**: Clothing Filter, Winter Items Filter
- **Ingredients**:
  - Beefalo Wool (x8)

- **Durability**: Wears out in 10 days
- **Perk**: Delays Freezing. Lowers Beefalo aggression during mating season.
- **Spawn Code**: "beefalohat"

## Quotes

## Scrapbook Info
Makes the wearer friendly to Beefalo in heat.

## Tips
- When the player is roaming around Beefalos or shaving them at night during mating season, it's advised to wear this hat to keep from being attacked.
- Players should take off the Hat when next to a fire (or replace it with a sanity-boosting hat) as the item's durability will go down if kept on, and the fire alone is enough to keep the character warm.

## Trivia
- This item used to increase the player's Sanity per minute by a slight amount of points.
- The previous crafting description ("And you thought they smelled bad on the outside") was a reference to Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.
- Despite having two horns on it, the hat only takes one Beefalo Horn to craft.

## Description

Garlic Powder is an Item exclusive to Don't Starve Together. It can only be crafted by Warly in the Seasonings Filter using three Garlics at the Portable Grinding Mill.

After eating a seasoned dish, the player gets 33% Damage Reduction, this act on physical damage, planar damage, fire damage, freezing damage, overheating damage, and every other kind of damage.

Eating multiple dishes seasoned with Garlic Powder does not stack the effect, but resets the cooldown period.

Cloth is a Refined Item introduced in the Shipwrecked DLC. It requires a Science Machine to prototype and 3 Bamboo to craft. Cloth can also be occasionally found when Hammering Crates or floating on the water in Ship Graveyards. It is used in many crafting recipes and can be used as Fuel.

## Hamlet
Cloth is also included in the Hamlet DLC, required to craft Pith Hats and Gas Masks. However, it cannot be refined from Bamboo until the blueprint has been obtained from hammering the A Smashing Pot, so players must acquire Cloth through different means. A piece of Cloth can be acquired by hammering the hot air balloon debris scattered around the player's spawn point. Cloth can also be bought in the Pigg and Piglet's General Store for 5 Oincs.

There is a small chance (around 7%) for Bamboo to be obtained from hammering the A Smashing Pot and the corresponding blueprint for making cloth from it (has 4% chance). Another way for obtaining cloth is through trawling in the hamlet ponds (1.96% chance).

## Trivia
- The Think Tank was introduced in the **Turn of Tides** update.
- Maxwell's quote seems to suggest that Wilson is the one who invented the Think Tank.
- WX-78's quote is a pun based on the [C# programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)).
- On release, the Think Tank was able to open gifts like the Science Machine and **Alchemy Engine**.

# Basalt Eruption

- **Tool Needed**: Pickaxe
- **Products**: Flint (1-3), Rocks (1-3)
- **Renewable**: Yes
- **Spawns from**: Large Iron Hulk
- **Spawn Code**: rock_basalt
- **Images**: 
  - ![Basalt Eruption Image](Basalt%20Eruption.png)

**Quotes**:
- Wilson: A rock infused with other rocks.
- Willow: It's a rock. I can't even burn it.
- Wolfgang: Is rock.
- Wendy: A rock from the bowels of the earth.
- WX-78: A ROCK PART
- Wickerbottom: An igneous rock formation.
- Woodie: Bet I could break that.
- Maxwell: That robot certainly leaves a mark.
- Wagstaff: An angular formation of rocks formed by a giant automaton.
- Wigfrid: A battle has been fought here!
- Webber: It's a rock. The robot made it.
- Walani: A rock. That robot made it.
- Warly: I could serve lunch on that rock.
- Woodlegs: 'tis a rock. Nothin' ta lose yer 'ead over.
- Wilba: 'TIS A ROCK O' THE SMASHY ROBOT
- Wormwood: Rock
- Wheeler: A rock. You see a lot of them around here.
- Choose: Maxwell

## Tips

- Basalt Eruptions are the biggest source of Rocks and Flint in Hamlet worlds. One single body slam from the Large Iron Hulk can yield an average of 32 Basalts (as long as no objects nor the map border interrupt its formation), and each body slam destroys the old Basalts in range while creating new ones, making a rich source for the 2 minerals.
  - This can be used as a risky farm for both resources; as long as the player evades the Large Iron Hulk's attacks, it will spawn Basalt Eruptions rings indefinitely.
- The player should make sure to have a Pickaxe or other rock-breaking object when fighting the Large Iron Hulk, since defeating it may leave the player trapped inside the Basalt ring. Its remaining head can be awakened and lured towards Basalt Eruptions in order to mine them without spending resources on Pickaxes.

## Trivia

- When it was first implemented, the name was spelled incorrectly as "Basalt Erruption". This was later fixed.
- Basalt Eruption was added in the April 18, 2019 update.

## Description

The **Teetering Junk Pile** is a structure that appears in the **Junk Yard** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in the **From Beyond** expansion.

Roughly 10 days after the **Nightmare Werepig** has been defeated, the player may rummage through the pile to find the head of the **Scrappy Werepig** emerging from the trash. He may be left there without consequence, but one may also rummage two more times to free the initially neutral Scrappy Werepig. This action will also immediately cause a bunch of junk piles to fly out, which, when landing, can cause damage and sometimes spawn a **Junk Pile**.

If the Nightmare Werepig is currently undefeated, or the Scrappy Werepig has been successfully defeated, the player may rummage through the pile to retrieve some items every two minutes.

- **Wormwood:** Home made of friends
- **Wheeler:** Seems... safe?
- **Choose:** Warly

The **Palm Leaf Hut** is a craftable **Structure** in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC. It is found under the **Survival Tab** and requires **Palm Leaf**, **Bamboo**, and **Rope** to craft, and an **Alchemy Engine**, or a **Sea Lab** to prototype. As long as the player is under, it provides complete protection from **Rain** and 180 point protection against **Overheating**. A Palm Leaf Hut does not have durability and will not expire over time; however, it can still be destroyed by **Fire** or by other means that destroy player structures. Despite its flimsy appearance, it is also not affected by **Strong Winds**.

It should be noted that the protective area of the Palm Leaf Hut is quite a bit larger than the apparent size of its roof, and players will be protected even if they appear to be just partially under it. If placed close enough to a safe source of heat (Chiminea or Firepit), one can dry off even during heavy storms.

The Merms will also receive the lunar buff here. This turf replaces Sanity with Enlightenment. Gestalts can appear on this turf.

Unlike the common Marsh Turf, the mutated marsh turf can't be dug up, can't be used for planting, using the Garden Digamajig or building Wurt structures.

## Scrapbook Info

Wearer can hide under the bush and will not be attacked by creatures as long as they didn't see the survivor hide.

## Crafting

The Bush Hat is a wearable Dress Item. It requires 1 Straw Hat, 1 Rope, and 1 Berry Bush to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

To hide in the hat, the player has to click the RMB (Right Mouse Button) over the Bush Hat while it's in the head slot on the inventory toolbar. Right-clicking the hat again does not undisguise but instead takes the hat off the head slot. Moving around will immediately remove the disguise.

When hiding, enemies will not notice the player unless the enemy was already targeting the player. Charlie is not fooled by the disguise. Also, Gobbler can distinguish between Berry Bushes and the Bush Hat; hence, they will not approach the player when the player is hiding with the Bush Hat.

## Tips

- The Bush Hat is an effective method for avoiding incoming Hound attacks, as the Hounds will simply pass by a player hidden in the hat. This trick can be especially useful when around Beefalo, since using the bush hat will instantly cause the hounds to attack any nearby mobs.
- Camping out in Spider-infested territories is dangerous (unless playing as Webber), especially during long winter nights. Utilizing the Bush Hat will spare the wearer from dealing with spiders during the night.
- The Bush Hat is also useful in Caves/Ruins situations to hide during aggressive stages of the Nightmare Cycle. Note that a light source can still be equipped in the hand slot.
- If the player doesn't have a ranged weapon or can't corner a Koalefant they want to kill, they can hide in a Bush Hat when the closest distance is reached. Then the Koalefant may wander over, giving the player a chance to hit it before it can flee.
- Using the Bush Hat with Willow's Lighter works well if one does not have time to set up a camp or it's too dangerous, as her Lighter will stay active to protect her from Charlie indefinitely (excludes Don't Starve Together), and the Bush Hat will prevent her from being spotted by hostile mobs, provided she hasn't already been seen.

When hammered, Sea Walls will drop one or two pieces of **Coral** depending on their health. They cannot be repaired with Limestone or Coral.

## Trivia
* Sea Walls were added to the **Shipwrecked** DLC more than a year after its official completion in the **Home Sea Home** update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.

- **Tier**: 2

### Quotes
- Wilson: For keeping my ships in tiptop shape!
- Willow: It's a fixin' machine.
- Wolfgang: Will make boats mighty again!
- Wendy: It wards off the inevitable decay.
- WX-78: BOAT MAINTENANCE: ENGAGED

- Woodie: Open for business.

- Woodlegs: That'll give Sea Legs a leg up! Harr!
- Wilba: IT FIXETH WILBA SHIP
- Wormwood: Fixing
- Wheeler: If I had this for my balloon, I wouldn't be stranded here.
- Choose: Wilson

The Sea Yard is a craftable Structure exclusive to the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It is found in the Nautical Tab and requires 4 Logs, 6 Limestone, and 6 Tar to craft. The Sea Yard can only be placed in the Ocean and can be used to repair damaged Boats at a rate of 0.5% per second.

To start the automatic repairing, the boat needs to be bought close to the structure, and also the player must refuel the Sea Yard occasionally using Tar. The repairing will stop once the boat is back to full durability, if the boat moves too far away from the structure, or if it runs out of fuel. The player doesn't necessarily need to be in the boat for the Sea Yard to keep repairing the boat. When fully repaired, the Seagull sitting on top of the Sea Yard will repeatedly make loud noises.

If several Sea Yards are placed close to each other, only one will be activated to repair the player's boat.

### Tips
- Since the Sea Yard restores a percentage of boat HP per second instead of a set amount of HP, it is best used to repair Encrusted Boats (repairs 4 HP/sec) and to a lesser degree, Armored Boats (repairs 2.5 HP/sec).
- Building a Ballphin Palace or Buoy right next to the Sea Yard provides a permanent light source at night, as well as a means to recover sanity by befriending the Bottlenose Ballphin.
- Building a Sea Yard very close to a Brainy Sprout is an excellent choice of location. Not only does the sprout have a +25/min sanity aura, it also provides light during dusk and night. Placing a Buoyant Chiminea nearby will also allow the player to dry off if needed while waiting for repairs to complete.
- Crafting a Sea Chest or other container near the Sea Yard to store sanity boosting equipment (such as a Shark Tooth Crown, Thulecite Suit, Limestone Suit, etc.) is recommended for convenient sanity regeneration while the player waits for repairs. Storing Tar for refueling is also a good idea.

### Trivia
- The Sea Yard was added to the Shipwrecked DLC more than a year after its official completion in the Home Sea Home update, after being tested in a beta branch for several months.
- If healed using the Sea Yard, the Sea Legs and Armored Boat are the most efficient boats for travelling, since they gain 57.6 wall units of travel distance per second spent healing.

## Description
Cave Lichen is a harvestable fungus found in the Ruins, commonly in the Wilds and occasionally Village Biomes. A small number can also be found in the Labyrinth near the Ancient Guardian. When harvested, it yields 1 Lichen and then takes 3-5 days to become harvestable again. It does not grow during Winter.

Cave Lichen cannot be relocated. They are flammable and will leave behind 1 Ashes when burned.

## Prototype Tips
- Lichen counts as a vegetable and can easily be collected in large quantities facilitating certain Crock Pot recipes, due to the abundance of Cave Lichen in the Ruins.

## Trivia
- Cave Lichen used to be green before it was changed in the Stuff of Nightmares update.

Poisonous Holes are naturally occurring objects present in Tidal Marsh biomes in the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC.

Approximately every 3.5 seconds, the Poisonous Hole will release a toxic cloud of gas, which will **Poison** the player or any **Mob** standing too close when this happens. The player can protect themselves from being poisoned by Poison Holes by wearing a **Particulate Purifier**. **WX-78** does not require a Particulate Purifier for protection, since they are immune to Poison.

When a Poisonous Hole is dug up with a **Shovel**, it will be destroyed in the process and has a 50% chance to drop either a **Venom Gland** or **Rot**. Once a Poisonous Hole has been dug up, it will not return.

# Treeguards

Treeguards are **Boss Monsters** that can occasionally transform from **Evergreens** when a nearby Evergreen is chopped down.

## Behavior

When one appears, a Treeguard aims to attack whoever chopped down a tree near them, and follows them limitlessly, only stopping when several new trees are planted nearby. Planting a **Pine Cone** within 16 units has a 15% chance to calm them, and within 5 units away has a 33% chance. Treeguards growl every time a pine cone is planted, even if they're sleeping.

The moment a Treeguard is pacified, it returns to the ground disguised as an ordinary tree, as if it were asleep. A Treeguard in this state does not wave in the wind, does not have a trunk, and does not appear on the **Map**. During **Winter**, sleeping Treeguards also don't have snow, making them easy to distinguish from actual trees.

At **night**, neutral Treeguards go to sleep, plopping down wherever they happen to be standing. If no one chops a nearby tree or attacks the sleeping Treeguard, it will not wake up until morning comes. At day, neutral Treeguards wander aimlessly until night comes or until they are angered again. Neutral Treeguards can still be put to sleep with pine cones.

## Hunting

Each tree felled has a 1.33% chance of summoning a Treeguard. Having trouble with this is quite normal. A way to speed up this process is to get help chopping trees by befriending Pigs. They chop trees if they see the player do it, and they continue to chop them down until the player runs away. If the Pigs spawn Treeguards, the Treeguards will attack the Pigs instead of the player.

## Combat

Treeguards have a great deal of health, but are slow. An effective way to wear the monster down is by dodging its attack, and then running in to strike 3–4 times before dodging again, although this will drain **Sanity** considerably. This method works especially well with **Woodie**'s Beaver form.

Leading a Treeguard to other hostile creatures or vice versa is another effective way to kill either. **Pigs** will attack them on sight, and multiple Pigs can easily disorient a Treeguard by the

## Overview

It is currently available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux through Steam or as a standalone app. Don't Starve is also available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PlayStation Vita, and Wii U.

## Official Description

Don't Starve is a hardcore survival game in a wild nature filled with science and magic.

You play as Wilson, a fearless gentleman scientist who has fallen into the trap of a demon and was transported to the Constant Mysterious World of the Wild Nature. Wilson must learn to use the surrounding environment and its inhabitants if he ever hopes to be saved and find his way home.

Dive into a strange and unexplored world full of strange creatures, dangers, and surprises. Gather resources to create items and structures that match your style of survival. Play your way, unraveling the mysteries of this strange land.

### Key Features

- **Uncompromising wilderness survival and world exploration:** No instructions. No help. No support. Start from scratch and create, hunt, explore, farm, and fight for survival.
- **Gloomy and whimsical visual effects:** Two-dimensional characters and strange creatures inhabiting a unique three-dimensional world.
- **Randomly generated new worlds:** Want a new map? No problem! At any time, you can generate a new living and breathing world that hates you and wishes you death.

## Review

Don't Starve presents the player with the task of surviving in the wild as long as possible. The game in Survival Mode ends only with the player's death or by restarting the game in a new random world using a [[Woodie|Woodie]]'s [[Dercy]] relic. When the player dies, they receive Experience based on the number of days they survived. Each death gives experience that adds to the total amount and is used to unlock additional playable [[Characters|characters]]. Although death is inevitable and the player's world will be lost when the game ends, various ways to resurrection can be found to avert the inevitable.

## Story

The canonical plot of the game focuses on [[Wilson]], a gentleman scientist, whom the mysterious [[Maxwell (NPC)|Maxwell]] forced to build a machine that transported him to a strange world filled with [[monsters]] and other problems. The player must help Wilson navigate through different worlds of [[Adventure Mode|Adventure]] that become increasingly more complex as the game progresses. Wilson begins to understand why Maxwell brought him to this world and what the dreadful secret of his power is. Along the way, the player will find [[Webber]], an additional character that can only be unlocked in Adventure mode, and will eventually confront Maxwell himself.

## Updates

Klei Entertainment, the game's developer, promised to release a series of updates to the game at least 6 months after the initial release. A significant part of these updates was focused on adding a new environment (Cave) to the game, along with other new content and bug fixes.

On January 10, 2019, Klei Entertainment released the Quality of Life update, which added features that were previously exclusive to Don't Starve Together. These features were added to the base game as well as all DLCs.

On April 27, 2023, the Mega-update "Don't Starve Together" was added, fixing many long-standing bugs, balancing changes, and adding many QoL changes from Don't Starve Together.

# Bee Box

## Overview
The **Bee Box** is a craftable structure that uses bees to accumulate honey that can be harvested. It belongs to the Food Tab and requires a Science Machine to prototype.

## Crafting
- Ingredient 1: Boards (Multiplier: 2)
- Ingredient 2: Honeycomb (Multiplier: 1)
- Ingredient 3: Bee (Multiplier: 4)

## Description
- Stores your own bees.
- Can be Hammered to release bees and collect honey.
- Can be picked to collect honey.

## Behavior
- Spawns a new bee every 120 seconds up to a maximum of 4 per box.
- Bees return to their box at dusk but leave during daytime.
- Bees can act as a worker or a fighter depending on the situation.
- Attacking a bee or catching one with a Bug Net will cause all members of the hive to emerge as Killer Bees.

## Honey Production
- Speed of honey gathering is affected by the quantity and proximity to flowers near a Bee Box.
- A bee successfully pollinates 6 flowers to increase honey by 1.
- Having less than 6 flowers around a Bee Box halts production entirely.

## Tips
- Bees are slow and can be outrun if aggravated.
- Equipping a Walking Cane or building a Cobblestone path to the Bee Box can help in harvesting honey without fear of retaliation.

## Hermit Bee Box
- Exclusive to Don't Starve Together, found on the Hermit Island.
- Works like a normal bee box but cannot be destroyed or burned.

Logs are dropped from Evergreens, Mushtrees, Cave Banana Trees, and Birchnut Trees after cutting the trees with an Axe. The larger the Tree, the more logs are dropped. There are three evergreen tree sizes, which yield 1, 2 or 3 logs depending on the size.

Tree Stumps from cut Evergreens and Mushtrees can be dug using a Shovel to get one extra log. Spiky Trees can also be cut with a chance of getting a log and another one when dug up. Mining full Tall Stalagmites may also yield a log.

In Werebeaver form, Woodie can eat Logs to replenish his Log meter.

## Description
Junk Pile is a structure that appears naturally in the Junk Yard in different sizes, exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in the From Beyond Update. You may rummage through one a certain amount of times depending on the size of the pile, and each completed rummage will net you either useful items, a mob, or nothing at all.

W.O.B.O.T. will always spawn very close to a junk pile in the Junk Yard.

If you decide to leave the junkyard area after having engaged the Scrappy Werepig in a fight, he will retreat to the Teetering Junk Pile and throw a pile of garbage at you, which, if it hits the floor, will leave a Junk Pile in its place. This can be performed infinitely for as much junk as the player is willing to spawn.

Any Spiders, Catcoons, or Spider Warriors which are found in Junk Piles will be immediately aggressive, almost always getting an attack in the player before one has the chance to react.

The **Claw Palm Tree** is a tree type exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. When chopped down with an Axe, it will yield up to 3 Cork, and like most other trees, the stump can be dug up to yield an additional Cork.

Unlike other trees, it does not yield any seeds that can be replanted to grow another tree. Instead, the player will have to manually craft the **Claw Palm Sapling** using one Cork and one Manure (prototyping it requires a Science Machine).

Claw Palm Trees have a chance to be **Peculiar**, making them investigable with a **Magnifying Glass** or Wagstaff's **Spectoggles**.

## Trivia
- Claw Palm Trees originally had red leaves, but the color was changed in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet#Version History** update to make them more distinguishable from **Rainforest Trees**.
- Despite Wickerbottom saying that the tree is a form of [palm tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae), when examining Cork she says it came from the Quercus Suber, a cork oak.
