# Animals

Animals are Mobs found throughout the world and are typically not hostile unless provoked (with the exception of Beefalo in heat and hungry Smallish Tallbirds). Some Animals are passive and will never attack. They simply flee from danger or ignore the attacker, which typically results in their death.

Some of the creatures below will raise a player's naughtiness rating when directly killed. Some passive creatures are protected by stronger, neutral Mobs, attacking them may incur the wrath of the stronger Mob. Main example of this is Tiger Shark protecting its Sharkitten. When a neutral creature is attacked, nearby members of the same or similar species may join the fight against the attacker.

Traders are passive mob that cannot be attacked or killed, and the player can give Trinkets and certain Foods to these mobs in exchange for various rewards.

## Behavior
The Queen Womant is a Boss Monster exclusive to the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. She can be accessed by going to the deepest part of a Mant Hill. The battle takes place in a pseudo-dungeon known as the Queen Womant Chambers. As a result, the screen will not scroll with the player. The Queen sits on a Stalagmite Throne in the center of the screen at all times. She will create 2 Mant Warrior Eggs when she enters battle, which hatch into Mant Warriors, creating more once they are all killed. She will also cause periodic Earthquakes, causing various minerals and hostile mobs to rain down from the ceiling.

When Queen Womant enters her second phase at low health she will gain an additional attack; she will blow into her tail like a bagpipe, causing all game sounds to stop. The red Sanity tendrils will appear around the player's screen, the player's Sanity will be drained, and the character will be locked into an animation for the duration of the attack, unable to move or act. The effects of the blow can be mitigated by wearing Rabbit Earmuffs.

Other than the Mant Warriors she summons, the earthquakes and tail blowing attack, the Queen Womant is helpless by herself and can be attacked without her attacking back.

After defeating her, she will drop the Royal Crown and a Blueprint for Bundling Wrap, although sometimes the player must mine the throne in order to access the items. Another effect of her defeat is that the rooms leading to her lair will be lit.

## Tips
- The player can trick the Mant Warriors into getting stuck behind her throne, which is accomplished by quickly running around the edge of the throne after dodging an attack. This is easier with high speed, so items increasing speed (such as Coffee) should be utilized. Once the Mant Warrior gets stuck, the player can attack Queen Womant without interruption.
- Another trick is to build Walls that separate about a third of the room. With luck, one Mant egg will drop on the other side of the wall, allowing the player to quickly destroy the egg on the side they are standing on. Then the player can freely attack the Queen Womant without interference by the Mant Warrior on the other side.
- It's a good strategy to just use Pew-matic Horn and use rocks as ammo because she will mostly drop rocks in her earthquake move.
- Mant Warriors are easily crowd controlled, taking only one Sleep Dart or two Ice Staff hits to be taken out of the fight for a considerable amount of time. If the player is able to defeat one of the Mant Warriors that is summoned, they can keep the other one immobilized with these two items while they attack the defenseless Queen.

## Bugs
- It is possible to get stuck inside the Queen's throne if the player walks towards it as she dies. However, it is possible to get out if

# Turfs

**Turfs** are floor and ground [[Tile|tile]] [[Item|items]]. They can be dug up with a [[Pitchfork]] and used for decoration or fuel. Turfs can fuel all structures except the [[Night Light]]. Turfs cannot be used to fertilize plants.

![Wilson with a Pitchfork and tile digging indicator visible](Wilson with a Pitchfork and tile digging indicator visible.png =200x)

Turfs generally don't affect [[Mobs]] except for specific cases:

- Some birds only land on certain turfs and certain seasons.
- [[BFB]] cannot land on Deep rainforest and Gas rainforest turfs because they have a canopy. It cannot land on all kinds of turfs in the [[Pig City]], either.
- Spider nests create a special turf called [[Spider Den#Sticky Webbing|Sticky Webbing]], which slows the player and some Mobs down.

[[Road]]s and [[Trail]]s are not turfs and cannot be moved. If the player digs up a [[Runic Turf]], it will be destroyed. Cobblestones give the player 30% faster movement. Scaled Flooring reduces heat.

## Downloadable Content

In the ''[[Shipwrecked]]'' DLC, [[Flooding|Puddles]] cannot spawn on craftable turfs but they can still flood them. [[Coffee Plant]] and [[Elephant Cactus]] can only be planted on ashy, magma, or volcanic turfs, but they can grow on any turf after they have been planted.

In the ''[[Hamlet]]'' DLC, [[Nettle]] can be planted on any turf, but they can only grow on [[Dense Turf|Dense]] or [[Deep Rainforest]] turfs. The player cannot use a [[Pitchfork]] to dig up Deep Rainforest and [[Gas Rainforest]] turfs. Pitchfork will lose all of its durability if the player tries to dig up Gas Rainforest turfs. [[Stone Road Turf]] gives the player 30% faster movement. Stone Road Turf, [[Flat Stone Turf]] and [[Lawn Turf]] prevents [[BFB]] from landing.

## DST Don't Starve Together

[[Dock Kit]] is a special turf exclusive in the ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'', it can only be placed on Coastal [[Ocean]] tile, and cannot be dug up with a Pitchfork; instead, its removal requires explosion damage like [[Gunpowder]]. When Dock Kit is placed on a Ocean tile, that [[Tile|tile]] will become walkable land.

## Turf List

| Turf | Name | DLC | Found at | Craft | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Forest Turf](Forest Turf.png =48x) | [[Forest Turf]] |  | [[Forest]] | {{pic32|Twigs}}×1 {{pic32|Pine Cone}}×1 {{DST|28}} | {{pic32|Terra Firma Tamper}} {{DST|28}} |
| ![Grass Turf](Grass Turf.png =48x) | [[Grass Turf]] |  | [[Grasslands]] | {{pic32|Cut Grass}}×1 {{pic32|Petals}}×1 {{DST|28}} | {{pic32|Terra Firma Tamper}} {{DST|28}} |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Priority

Turfs with higher priority or "dominance" will partly cover other turfs. For example, a [[Carpeted Flooring]] turf will always partly cover a [[Checkerboard Flooring]] turf when they are next to each other. Turf priority is purely aesthetic.

## Trivia

- Turf used to be dug up with a [[Shovel]].
- In the ''[[Hamlet]]'' DLC, [[Deep Rainforest]] Turf and [[Gas Rainforest]] Turf can be obtained using the [[Console]]. Their spawn codes are `"turf_deeprainforest"` and `"turf_gasjungle"` respectively.

- In Rhymes With Play # 278, they revealed concept art of an unused mob design. This creature could move in water and on land, but it would spawn only in the sea. It would require being fed, and would float away if you hit it.
- The first update, Turn of Tides was originally intended to be released on June 20, 2019.

# New York State Capitol fire (March 29, 1911)
[![New York State Capitol fire](https://youtu.be/15ESUxxJvZs)](https://youtu.be/15ESUxxJvZs){: .align-right width="300"}
> Like any good librarian, Ms. Wickerbottom believes in the preservation and distribution of knowledge. Well… most knowledge, that is. There are some things that must be kept hidden away from the eyes of the public. Who knows what could happen if certain secrets fell into the wrong hands?

An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [Compendium](https://don't-starve-game.fandom.com/wiki/Compendium):
> When people meet Ms. Wickerbottom, most assume that what you see is what you get. She certainly looks every bit the typical librarian that she claims to be, as at home amongst the bookstacks as any creature in their native habitat. Nobody would raise an eyebrow at such a person being well-versed in a wide range of subjects. Who would spare a second thought if, upon further inquiry, her knowledge rivaled that of experts? And obviously, no one would think of questioning what a librarian might be involved in after hours, when the library doors are closed to the public...

On the morning of March 29, 1911, a fire destroyed substantial portions of the New York State Capitol, including vast holdings of the New York State Library and the New York State Museum. It destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of documents and books. At this time, Wickerbottom worked there. The library also had a secret room in which Wickerbottom kept information from the Codex Unmbra, as well as from Maxwell's books. During the fire, Maxwell appeared to Wickerbottom and offered a deal to keep all the important information of the library. Wickerbottom agreeing to the deal ends up in the Constant. Maxwell's shadow takes passages from the Codex Umbra.

## Don't Starve Together
During Charlie's reign, when all the characters can meet each other in person. Finding a portal in the atrium, they insert a key that sends him, as well as Willow, Wolfgang, Wendy, Wigfrid and Wickerbottom to the world of The Forge. There, after defeating the Pugna warriors, they get the keys and enter the world of The Gorge. The Gorge includes Wilson, Wickerbottom and Wendy. After they have fed the Gnaws enough they get the money and the portal is up and running, after that they open the portal and get back to their world.
Wickerbottom helped [[Woodie]] create [[Kitschy Idols]].
She was also one of the people who discovered [[Mysterious Energy]].

## Trivia
* Wickerbottom's first name is unknown.
* Wickerbottom is fond of seafood, judging from her [[Wickerbottom quotes|examination quotes]] for various fish dishes and her favorite food.
* [[Wilson]] believes that Wickerbottom has, or at least used to have, a pet cat. When Wickerbottom examines the [[Lucky Cat Jar]], she sighs, and when she examines a [[Critters#Kittykit|Kittykit]], she says "Now it feels like home.", which provides further evidence to this. This is also later confirmed in her animated short, "One For the Books."
* When examining her book "Birds of the World", she says that the Western screech owl is her favorite. This is also the particular bird species in "[[The Screecher]]".
* She is the most literate of the "Don't Starve" characters and always refers to animals by their scientific names. The only exceptions to this are the creatures that are completely unknown to her. This can provide information as to what creatures in the [[The Constant|Constant]] exist in her homeworld.

## Description
Wobster Dinner is a [[Crock Pot]] recipe introduced in the *Don't Starve: Shipwrecked* DLC. It is cooked by adding 1 [[Wobster]] and 1 [[Butter]]. It takes 20 seconds to cook and restores 60 HP, 37.5 Hunger, and 50 Sanity, making it one of the best food items to restore both [[Health]] and [[Sanity]].

Adding any Meats to the recipe will produce [[Meatballs]] instead. Adding any additional [[Fishes|Fish]] with meat value will result in [[Seafood Gumbo]] instead, unless a [[Twigs|Twig]] is also added, which may result in [[Fishsticks]]. Adding Ice will result in [[Lobster Bisque|Wobster Bisque]] instead. Adding [[Shark Fin]] will result in [[Shark Fin Soup]] instead.

This recipe has a higher [[Crock Pot#Priority|Crock Pot Priority]] than Monster Lasagna, therefore it allows using more than one [[Durian]]s and/or [[Jellyfish]]es as fillers. However, Monster Meat cannot be used due to recipe restriction of not allowing meats.

## Prerequisites
- Requires: [[File:Wobster.png|link=Wobster]]
- Requires: [[File:Butter.png|link=Butter]]
- Excludes: [[File:Ices.png|link=Ice]]

## Description
The Thunderbird is a Mob exclusive to the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. It can be found in the Painted Biome. Its head will follow the player's movements. If the player gets close (about 2 Pitchfork tiles) the bird will charge up, and make electric sounds. If the player gets even closer (about one Pitchfork tile) the bird will emit three Lightning bolts around it at random, dealing 10-20 damage per strike (depending on Wetness level), likely hitting the player or nearby trees with at least one.

Thunderbirds can be chased down and killed after they release their charge, since it takes them a minute before they can strike again. They respawn at their Thundernest 5 days after being killed.

## Tips
- WX-78 players can use the Thunderbird's electrical attack to attain System Overload.
- The Thunderbird's electrical attack can revive the Iron Hulks.
- If there is an Iron Hulk piece nearby you can approach the thunderbird safely as it will attract all the lightning, even as WX-78.
- During the Aporkalypse, Thunderbirds emit 10 Lightning bolts instead of 3.
- Thunderbirds do not flee from Abigail. Wendy players can easily kill these by staying out of their lightning bolt range and commanding Abigail to attack. During the day time, Abigail will need to be commanded a second time or else she will lose interest due to the lack of counter attack.
- It only takes one hit from a Blow Dart to kill a Thunderbird, so using the disarming kit to collect Blow Darts from Striking Carvings will help with collecting iron ore, drumsticks, and Thunderbird Feathers.

## Trivia
- The Thunderbird is a mythological figure in certain cultures of the indigenous people of North America.
- The Thunderbird's design bears a strong resemblance to the head of the Screecher.

# Summer

**Quote:** "It might be okay if it was cooler." - Wilson

Summer is the last season for a typical game cycle. Adventure Mode worlds have different seasonal variations.

## Seasonal Details

During summer, most creatures are active, and the days are longer. Crops grow, and Food is easier to find. Rain occasionally falls during summer, which reduces Sanity and may result in Lightning strikes; however, it also speeds up crop growth.

- The Mactusk N' Son hunting party is not present at their Walrus Camp during summer.
- Red Hounds may occasionally appear rather than Blue Hounds during periodical Hound attacks.
- Redbirds and Crows appear and the Koalefant appears with a reddish hide.
- Caves and Ruins are in a state of permanent summer.

## Reign of Giants

In the Reign of Giants DLC, Summer is replaced by Autumn and is given its own season along with Spring. It lasts for 16 days by default. Therefore, the first Summer will last from day 21 to 36, or from day 56 to 71. Summer leads into Autumn. Summer is indicated by the world having a more sepia-toned tint than normal, which changes in brightness periodically, and by DSP which causes sound effects and music to sound far away and hot, similar to Winter's muffled sounds. Days are also much longer in Summer, with Dusk being the shortest, lasting just one segment during mid-season. The length of the Night is average.

### Summer Effects

- Plants will wilt and require fertilization in order to regrow, and food will spoil 25% faster.
- Plants return to normal a few days into Autumn, even without fertilizer.
- Fertilized crops tend to grow fast due to longer daylight but not as fast as during spring due to less rain.
- Food spoils 25% faster during summer.
- Daylight-related Sanity is less of an issue than in other seasons.
- The world is presented in a sepia tone as opposed to the blue tint in winter.
- Cactus will yield Cactus Flowers when picked during Summer.
- Occasionally, the Dragonfly can be encountered. It will roam around the landscape, setting nearby structures on fire.
- In Don't Starve Together, the Antlion will emerge in its Desert on Day 2 of summer and a Sandstorm will cover said desert if the environment is dry.

### Overheating

The intense heat provides the challenge of the season. Similarly to freezing in the Winter, an unprotected player will suffer damage from Overheating. The player can use or wear items such as Ice, an Ice Cube or a Chilled Amulet and can stand under a tree to cool themselves. They can also use the shade from a Straw Hat, Umbrella or Eyebrella, or wear a Summer Frest or Floral Shirt to delay the rate at which they overheat. The player can also freeze a Thermal Stone (or two) in an Ice Box or Snow Chester or stand near the Endothermic Fire to cool it and themselves.

### Wildfires

Additionally, the Summer season experiences a drought, and items can ignite and burst into flames. When the world temperature is above 80 degrees, every 45 seconds, the game attempts to set a burnable object within 25 units, or 6¼ pitchfork tiles, of the player (or near every player, excluding the ones in the Sandstorm) on fire. There is a 20% chance that this attempt will succeed. This includes plants, such as Berry Bushes, mobs, and even structures like the Science Machine. Caution is advised as the fire will keep spreading. When Structures have been burnt down, players can hammer them down to recover half the components, including single components. Wildfires occur only on the surface (and only when it is not night or dusk time).

Items and Structures can be protected from combustion by using an Ice Flingomatic, which will fire snowballs at flaming objects. Objects will only combust when near the player, so they may also be protected simply by avoiding them until Autumn.

An object nearing its combustible point will begin to smolder first and visually smoke. The player's character will comment on it when it is examined. Smoldering objects can be manually cooled with Ice, Fertilizers, an Ice Staff or with the player's hands (causing damage of 5 Hp (3 Hp in Don't Starve Together) for the player). The eventual fire created by a smoldering object will cause other flammable things near its vicinity to near-instantly burst into flames as well, quickly spreading the fire.

In Don't Starve Together, any fires will first make nearby flammable objects smolder as well, meaning wildfires don't spread as fast as they do in the single player game. Wildfires also will not occur within a Sandstorm, which makes Antlion's Desert an optimal area

## Abernathy and Parker Circus

[The Incredible Strongman](https://youtu.be/7lSuKwCDfm4)
{: .align-right width="300px"}

> Wolfgang always prided himself on his strength, but after an embarrassing mishap reveals his might to be a touch exaggerated, he finds himself eager to accept any opportunity to get stronger… no matter how dubious the source.

Wolfgang's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled [The Incredible Strongman](Animated%20Shorts%20and%20Trailers#The%20Incredible%20Strongman). An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [Compendium](https://www.example.com):

> Prior to his time in the Constant, Wolfgang's life revolved around one single-minded pursuit of one goal: to become the strongest man there ever was. His quest would lead him across Europe and eventually even across the Atlantic to America, where his feat of muscular prowess caught the attention of Misters Abernethy & Parker, who invited him to headline in their newly-formed traveling circus. Wolfgang quickly found himself caught up in the pageantry of circus life, and his attetion began to shift to finding ways to make his show more spectacular. Fearing his own strenght wouldn't be enough to keep impressing the crowds, he started employing a bit of stage trickery, with each new act becoming more unbelievable than the last. As his act grew more outlandish, the risk of being exposed as a fraud grew, and as he suffered one embarassing mistake after another his once unshakeable confidence in his abilities was slowly chipped away.

> Until one day, a chance encounter gave him the a taste of the ultimate strength he had craved for so long...

Wolfgang spent most of his life trying to become the strongest man in the world. His quest took him across Europe and eventually even across the Atlantic to America, where his muscular prowess caught the attention of Messrs. Abernathy and Parker, who invited him to headline their newly formed traveling circus. Fearing that his powers weren't enough to make his show more spectacular, he began looking for ways to fool the audience. Each new performance became more incredible than the previous one. As his act became more and more outlandish, so did the risk of being exposed as a fraud.

On August 14, 1904, at the next performance, Wolfgang made it look like he was lifting a whole elephant, which impresses the audience. However, the mouse that slipped into the circus scared Wolfgang, because of which he moved away, but the elephant did not fall. It turned out that Wolfgang did not lift the elephant, the elephant was simply held by the platform. Because of this event, the audience was disappointed, and after that there were rumors that the tricks in the Abernethy & Parker circus were not real. This forced the circus to move further along its tour.

## Tragic Train Crash

![Fourth puzzle](William%20Carter%20Puzzle%204.jpg "Fourth puzzle"){: .thumbnail}

On August 15, 1904, the circus continued on its way. Suddenly, the vehicle transporting the elephant was damaged while passing through the Old Mill crossing. Because of this, the whole train crashed into the circus wagon. The elephant and passengers of the circus wagon were saved.

After the disaster, Wolfgang met an unfamiliar man, Willam Carter, who was stuck under a train car. He did not have enough strength to save the victim, so the Codex unbra temporarily gave him the strength to lift the whole car. After Willam took the Wolfgang back and disappeared into the empty ones. Perhaps Wolfgang later testified to the newspaper that he met a tall man who ran away somewhere. After that, Willam Carter is considered dead.

### Newspaper quote:

> TRAGIC TRAIN CRASH
> Circus wagon struck at crossing
> Many passenger injuries reported
> Elephant unharmed

The only purely fish creatures that drop Raw Fish are the Ocean Fish.

Nettle is a Food Item exclusive to the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. It is found on Nettle Vines and has antihistamine properties when eaten, granting immunity to Hay Fever for 200 seconds while also restoring 10 Hunger and 10 Health.

## Quotes
- Wilson: "Science says the sharp edges are good for my lungs."
- Willow: "It smells funny."

- Wilba: "DOST UNSTUFF'DED MINE SNOUTS"
- Wormwood: "(sniiiiiff)"
- Wheeler: "Smells like relief."

## Usage
Nettle is required to make Nettle Rolls and Meated Nettles in the crockpot. When used as a filler in other crockpot recipes, Nettle is considered an edible ingredient similar to Ice and Snake Bones.

### Recipes
- **Nettle Rolls:** 3 Nettle + Filler = Nettle Rolls
- **Meated Nettles:** 2 Nettle + 1 Meats + Filler = Meated Nettles

## Tips
- Nettle does not spoil, making it a good item to stock for the long-term.
- Wigfrid is unable to eat Nettles or Nettle Rolls, so the player will want to rely on Meated Nettles or have a Gas Mask prepared before the Lush Season begins to avoid hay fever. Wormwood is immune to Hay Fever, so he doesn't need to eat Nettles or Nettle Rolls.
- As Nettle Rolls take 6 days to spoil, and Nettles never spoil, the best option is to stock Nettle and cook Nettle Rolls at the last moment. One can even keep some Nettles ready for the next Lush season.
- Utilizing nothing but raw Nettles, the player will need to amass 29 of them to sustain each Lush Season. This number is slightly lower due to the slight delay of Hay Fever's effects.
- Utilizing Nettle Rolls, the player will need to amass 24 raw Nettles exactly to sustain each Lush Season.
- Besides negating the effects of hay fever, it is also a good healing food.

![William Carter Puzzle 3](William_Carter_Puzzle_3.png "Letter from Jack Carter to William Carter")
![Character Refresh Trailer Promo](Character_Refresh_Trailer_Promo.png "Character Refresh Trailer Promo")

November 11, 1903 Abigail and Wendy were born. Their father is Jack Carter, brother of Willam Carter. Wendy's mother's name is unknown, but Yellow Moonlens is known to remind Wendy of her mother's eyes. They do not live in the city at the foot of the mountain, the name is quite a large and rich house. Wendy likes to do art more, as well as to study different types of flowers. She also collects flowers in her diary. Her twin is more athletic, active and cheerful than Wendy. One day Abigail fell off a cliff and fell right into the bushes with unknown flowers. Wendy and Abigail got matching flowers that day

## The letter from Jack Carter to Willam Carter reads:

"William,

You've finally come to America! How exciting! Has your show taken New York by storm yet? I fear we may have just missed each other - the city was too much for me, so I've gone west - It really is amazing out here - maybe you could visit sometime?

Have you corresponded with mother lately? The post is dreadfully inconsistent out here, I can't believe she hasn't met the twins yet!

Warmest regards,

-Jack."

# Death of Abigail

[![Death of Abigail](https://youtu.be/7ozRwX35fHE)](https://youtu.be/7ozRwX35fHE "Death of Abigail")

![Wendy's Nightstand Loading Screen](Wendy's_Nightstand_Loading_Screen.png "Wendy's Nightstand Loading Screen")

"Wendy clutches tightly to the memory of her twin sister, Abigail. Some days, it’s almost as if she never left…"

The events of this short were later officially summarized in DST's Compendium:

'Wendy's tale of woe began with the untimely loss of her dear sister Abigail. Unable to accept the thought of life without her twin, Wendy began turning to the occult in the hopes of finding some way to communicate with the other side. After much trial and error, séance candles burned down to nubs and spirit boards thrown away in frustration, Wendy was nearly ready to give up and fall into despair... until finally, there was a sign. A ragtime tune might seem like a strange message to send from the great beyond, but Wendy was desperate to grab hold of anything that might bring her closer to her sister. And sure enough, a voice would soon tell her exactly what she needed to do...

Under circumstances unknown to the players, Abigail died. This caused Wendy's depressive nature. Wendy jumped at every conceivable opportunity to get her sister back. This led her to spiritualism. After her sister's death, she also seems to be trying to reach out to Professor Mourire, who is supposedly able to talk to the dead. In her diary, Wendy writes that she hears ragtime music in her dreams over and over again, thinking that Abigail might be trying to contact her.

### Diary entry April 16, 1914

"April 16th, 1914

I keep hearing strange music when I dream... the same strange song repeating over and over... is it you, Abigail?
Are you trying to tell me something?"

# Hitting to Constant

Wendy after having tried to contact Abigail through the dead with no luck would instead find herself connecting with the constant as a ragtime tune could be heard through the beyond and where a voice would be heard. It can be assumed

# Floaty Boaty Knight
**Don't Starve: Shipwrecked Mob**

## Mob Infobox
- **Image**: ![Floaty Boaty Knight](File:Floaty Boaty Knight.png)
- **Health**: 500
- **Damage**: 50
- **Drops**: Gears ×1-3
- **Attack Period**: 6
- **Walk Speed**: 3
- **Run Speed**: 6
- **Spawn Code**: "knightboat"

## Quotes

- Willow: Check out your boat, mate.
- Wolfgang: Let us fight!
- Wendy: That thing has anger issues!
- WX-78: MY PEER HAS GONE PIRATE
- Wickerbottom: What a puzzling, mechanical sea horse!
- Woodie: That guy's got an attitude problem!

- Woodlegs: Th'navy is'ere!
- Wilba: 'TIS O'CLOCK O' THE SEA
- Wormwood: Floating Neigh
- Wheeler: Sure, you can float, but can you fly?
- Choose: Wickerbottom

## Behavior
The Floaty Boaty Knight is the aquatic version of the Clockwork Knight and the only mob which drops Gears in Shipwrecked. 3 of them can be found near the Wooden Platform Thing similar to the Wooden Thing in Don't Starve, but 1 to 3 may spawn at Coral Reefs or wherever the player has killed any sea life and spawn on the same spot after that.

As the Knights are basically boats, their attack is ranged. They shoot three shots of a Boat Cannon out of their heads in the direction of the player. Their aim is imprecise and shadows indicate where the projectiles will land so the player shouldn't have a problem avoiding them. They have no melee attack.

### Investigation and Spawning
Floaty Boaty Knights guard the Wooden Platform Thing and act as a navy of sorts, investigating creatures killed on the Ocean. Investigations start at the beginning of the game first, then restart when the Knights spawn from an investigation. Each investigation starts with a default time until spawn, ranging from 15 to 20 days at the beginning of the game, shortening over time to a minimum of 5 to 6 days. Every time the player kills any sea life, a potential location for the Knights to spawn is recorded, unless there is another potential location within about 2 screens away.

### Spawn Timers and Locations
| Game Day | Default Days Before Spawning | Number of Knights |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------|
| <20      | 15-20                       | 1              |
| 20-29    | 15-20                       | 2              |
| 30-49    | 10-12.5                     | 3              |
| 50-69    | 10-12.5                     | 3              |
| >69      | 7.5-8.5                     | 3              |

Knights will always avoid staying in melee range to the player, constantly running away if approached. But their movement speed is quite low, so the player should be able to catch up with them without any problems.

## Fighting Strategy
Floaty Boaty Knights only have ranged attacks, which can be predicted easily, so a player should have no trouble closing in on them. The Knight is unable to hit a target too close to them, and as such, will fall easily to a persistent player. Defeating them is usually a simple matter of chasing them into melee range, getting in as many hits as possible while they are firing their coconuts, and repeating until they are defeated. However, care should be taken not to drive them out to deeper water, as the waves may damage your boat as you are trying to fight them.

## Tips
- Floaty Boaty Knights are an easy source of gears. They can be farmed by killing any water Mob in an Ocean location over 2 screens away from the player's base, such as a Jellyfish. Players can periodically visit this area to kill any spawned knights. Killing knights will also count as Mob kills, and will spawn more knights later on, creating an infinite cycle. The cycle can however be interrupted if a mob is killed elsewhere on the Ocean, and that location is revisited first when the knights' cool down is over before the farming location.

## Description
Oinc is the currency used in the Hamlet DLC to purchase [Items] from [Pig Shops]. Players can acquire them by exchanging items with various [Pig Traders] (see page for more information).

The player will also be rewarded one Oinc for picking up [Manure] in the city, by the closest pig in range. Be careful then to pick Manure so that nearby Pigs can see it. After getting paid, all pigs will be on a short cooldown, preventing the player from being paid for picking up manure. This cooldown can be seen, as the pig who paid the player will not move until the cooldown ends. When the paying pig moves, the player can get paid for picking up another Manure. Oincs are necessary for crafting Items and Structures in the [Renovate Tab](Renovate%20Tab).

In the Shipwrecked DLC, all kinds of Oincs can be spent at the [Slot Machine] for a chance of a variety of rewards. They have a 50% chance to Wilton's Skull, a 33.3% chance to Carrot, and the chance for Gold Nugget remains the same as a Dubloon. Though the Tenpiece Oinc and the Centapiece Oinc are much more valuable than an Oinc, they are still being treated as a Oinc by The Slot Machine.

# Before Constant

![Woodie Missing Poster](Woodie_Missing_Poster.png "In Winona Short")

Woodie used to live in Canada (Judging by some quotes, he previously lived in the city, and then moved to a Canadian island to live in a forest camp). He lived in lumber camp. At some point, he made a deal with Maxwell via radio RP-76 and ended up in Constanta, leaving the house unattended. After this, he is considered missing, as can be seen on the Winona conspiracy board. His biography in DST's Compendium reveals a bit about himself:

> ''Hailing from the pine-covered mountains of the great white north, Woodie is an unassuming yet strangely mysterious man who keeps his past close to the vest (or in his case, the flannel). He is never seen without his signature bushy beard or trusty axe Lucy, who herself is a bit of an enigma. The other Survivors are not quite sure whether Woodie is simply mad, or if there might be something else to the seemingly inanimate object. Sometimes they swear they can hear a jovial female voice speaking to Woodie when no one else is around...''

Woodie's house was featured in the short film 'Constant Companion'. There are snowshoes in the house, indicating there appears a lot of snow where he lived, as well as two chairs, indicating that Woodie did not live alone.

# Don't Starve Together

[![Tree's A Crowd](https://youtu.be/d0r0WfV2y5s)](https://youtu.be/d0r0WfV2y5s)

In the animated short Tree's A Crowd, his DST exclusive forms Weremoose and Weregoose are given the spotlight. The short is officially summarized in the Compendium:

> ''As the power of the moon has grown, so too have the effects of Woodie's curse. Woodie soon found that his form would shift into not only the Werebeaver, but a Weremoose and Weregoose as well. As his changing forms became more unpredictable, Woodie resolved to find a way to have more control over his curse. Using every bit of knowledge he'd gained from his time in the Constant (and some additional tips from Ms. Wickerbottom) he soon discovered that his transformations could in fact be controlled. By fashioning representations of each of the three beasts and consuming them only when he wanted to invoke that form, Woodie now feels more comfortable in his own skin than he has in quite a while.''

# Trivia

## In-Game

- Kevin Forbes (the lead developer), when asked in the Klei forums if Woodie was crazy or not, said: "Other than the whole talks to his axe like it's a person thing, he's a pretty normal guy."
- Woodie apparently hates Birds or thinks they're evil.
- Woodie's examination of a Clockwork Bishop suggests he either is, or was, Catholic. ("It's been a while since my last confession.")
- When Woodie examines Cut Grass, his response suggests that he has hay fever. ("I think I might be allergic to this.") This is also suggested by his response to Grass Tuft. ("It makes my eyes water.")
- Upon examining a Straw Roll, Woodie will say he has slept on worse in lumber camp, revealing he may have once lived in a lumber camp before entering the Constant. This is supported by his quote for a Palm Tree in Shipwrecked. ("Makes me pine for the lumber yards.")
- His favorite food is

# Mods for Don't Starve

## Disclaimer
Mods, or modifications, are alterations or additions to the original content of a video game. They may present new features, player experiences, and/or tweaks to the game, making the game more enjoyable, or less enjoyable and either easier or harder.

Mods for Don't Starve are generally developed by the Don't Starve community.

## Installation
**Disclaimer: Klei is not able to help the player should issues arise while using mods. Use with caution!**

### Simple
The simplest way to download and install mods is to subscribe to them in the Steam Community Workshop. This will automatically download the mods into the game. The player can then enable/disable the installed mods by going into the "Mods" menu from the main menu, and ticking the mods' respective checkboxes.

- [Don't Starve Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=219740)
- [Don't Starve Together Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/322330/workshop/)

### Manual
Mods can also be downloaded as files from [Klei's official website](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/files/), or from [Don't Starve mods](https://dontstarvemods.com/) website, which must be manually placed into the appropriate "/mods/" directory of the game. The website contains downloadable files categorized into sections: Modding Tools, Game Modifications, Language Packs, Custom Maps and New Characters, etc. The same mods can usually be found from the Steam Community Workshop.

`{{GameDir|mods/|it=the 'mods' folder}}`

### Dedicated Servers
There are alternate steps to take when installing and enabling mods on dedicated servers.

- [Don't Starve Together Dedicated Servers#Mods](https://)

## Removal
If the player has installed mods incorrectly, then the best thing to do is to use the backup players have made. However, there is an alternative method if the player forgot to create a backup.

If the mod installed is a broken mod from the Steam Workshop, unsubscribe from it. Tell the author about the crash and include a list of all mods in the folder.

If it comes from a zip file that has been unpacked, go to the 'mods' folder mentioned above, then delete that mod folder, or move it elsewhere. In 99% of cases so far, players should only have to delete their scripts folder. Now, some of the players may realize that this is like dropping a bomb to kill a spider, but that's okay. It just guarantees that all traces of mods are removed.

Finally go to the Steam Library, Right-Click on the game and choose properties. In the tab Local Files, choose verify integrity of game cache. Steam will take care of the whole thing.

## Creation
Before creating new mods, players should read the [Guidelines](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/player-creation-guidelines). Players are recommended to be familiar with the [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) language and the TEX file format before creating any mods. There are also tutorials on the forum. The API doc (see below) also has one.

### Basic API Info
The mod system takes two most important files, `modinfo.lua` and `modmain.lua`. The earlier contains multiple info about the mod, like the name, version, and version compatibility. The latter is like the main() function in other languages—that is, where the mod system invoke and loads the mod. It has an environment itself.

The `data/scripts` folder under the game's program directory contains lua code for the vanilla game itself. You can refer to them for some API info. An [unofficial API doc](http://dontstarveapi.com) is also available.

### Modding Tools
| Name | Author | Version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Klei Studio](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/showthread.php?12434-REL-Klei-Studio-(-TEXTool-)-Underground) | Handsome Matt | Hungry for your hunger | Edit TEX and animation files of Don't Starve. |

# Minor Characters in Don't Starve Franchise

Besides the [[Characters|playable and non-playable characters]], various '''minor characters''' appear or are mentioned throughout the supplemental material of the ''[[Don't Starve]]'' franchise.

## Angeline and other members of Warly's family

[[File:Taste of Home Still1.png|thumb|Angeline with her son in ''Taste of Home'']]
'''Maman Angeline''' is [[Warly]]'s mother. She first appeared in the animated short ''[[Animated Shorts and Trailers#Taste of Home|Taste of Home]]''.

[[File:Wall Gramaphone.png|thumb|Promotional image for Warly's debut and ''Taste of Home'']]
Warly's [[Compendium]] entry explains that as she got older, Angeline started losing her memory. Because of this, Warly abandoned his career as a sous chef in Paris to take care of her.

It is implied in a promotional image for ''Taste of Home'' that she taught a young Warly how to fish.

Warly has several [[Warly quotes|examination quotes]] in ''Don't Starve Together'' mentioning Angeline:
- Iridescent Gem- "It glimmers like maman's eyes."
- Anchor Figure- "I think Maman would like this."
- End Table (wilted)- "I hope Maman Angeline is eating well without me."
- Codex Umbra- "Maman used to keep a journal, before her memory went."
- Plum Pudding- "Just like maman used to make."
- Celestial Altar- "You know how to get me home to maman?"
- Gestalt- "Can you... get me home to dear Maman?"
- Soprano Shell Bell- "Maman had a lovely seashell collection."

Warly also mentions his '''Nana''' in two quotes. The first is for [[Seafood Gumbo]] in ''[[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]]'' and ''Don't Starve Together'': "Incredible! Just like Nana used to make!" The other is for Shark Fin Soup in ''Shipwrecked'': "I used Nana's secret recipe."

Other members of '''Warly's family''' are pictured in the promotional image for ''Taste of Home'', including who is likely '''Warly's father''' as well as several silhouetted figures.

## Description

Tentacle Spots are a rare **item** with a 20% drop chance from a killed **Tentacle** and a 40% chance from a killed **Big Tentacle**. They can be used to craft the **Feather Hat**, and **Wickerbottom** can use them to craft the **Book**, "On Tentacles". Tentacle Spots do not spoil and can also be burned as fuel in a **Campfire** or **Fire Pit**.

## Downloadable Content

The **Reign of Giants** DLC adds another use for Tentacle Spots as one of the ingredients for a **Rain Coat**. Befriended **Catcoons** can also produce Tentacle Spots.

In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, Tentacle Spots can be obtained by killing the tentacles spawned by the **Quacken**.

## Usage

### Recipes

1. **Feather Hat**  
   - Ingredients:
     - Tentacle Spots x2  
     - Crow Feather x3  
     - Crimson Feather x2  
   - Tool: Alchemy Engine

2. **On Tentacles (Book)**  
   - Ingredients:
     - Tentacle Spots  
     - Papyrus x2  
   - Tool: Alchemy Engine  
   - Character: Wickerbottom

3. **Rain Coat**  
   - Ingredients:
     - Tentacle Spots x2  
     - Rope x2  
     - Bone Shards x2  
   - Tool: Alchemy Engine  
   - DLC: Reign of Giants

## Trivia

Multiple characters suggest that Tentacle Spots are the genitalia of the Tentacles, supported by Maxwell's quote, "This is how they reproduce", Wickerbottom's quote "Hmmm, reproductive organs", and Wilson's quote, "I think it was its genitalia". Other character quotes suggest this, but not as notable.

{{Quote|I say! There's something hidden here!|Warbucks}}

**Warbucks** was a [[Characters|Character]] exclusive to the ''[[Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet]]'' DLC. Warbucks was the tenth character to be unlocked via [[Experience]], requiring 2880 XP to become available. He was a stereotypical late 19th to early 20th century British explorer.

## Removal
In the [[Don't Starve: Hamlet#February 7th, 2019|February 7th, 2019 update]] of ''Hamlet's'' Early Access, Warbucks was removed from the game, making him unplayable for any new ''Hamlet''-enabled world. His files were kept in the game as a "Retired" character, and pre-existing saves with him would not change. This was also done with the intention of allowing players to use Warbucks with the help of [[mods]] or with [[console]] commands.[^1]

[^1]: [JoeW on the Forums](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/102600-game-update-307715/?page=10&tab=comments#comment-1153034), February 9, 2019

In the update post on the forums, [[Klei Entertainment]] gave their reasoning for removing him: "We weren't very happy with how Warbucks was working out. While trying to find ways to make him work, we decided that he just wasn't as interesting as we would like, and so we've made the decision to start from scratch with [[Wormwood|a new character]]."[^2]

[^2]: [Game Update 307715 on the Forums](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/102600-game-update-307715/), February 7, 2019

The reason for his removal was later clarified: "Ultimately we felt Warbucks was both culturally problematic and not also very interesting to play so we decided to start over. We understand some people may like aspects of him, and perhaps we will bring some of those aspects back one day. In the meantime, we've decided to move on."[^1]

## Trivia
* In the ''Hamlet'' beta, Warbucks could be "unlocked" by selecting a new game slot and clicking on either the ''[[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]]'' option or the ''[[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]]'' option. Warbucks could be selected from the character selection screen. The player would hit apply for Warbucks, then go back and click on the ''Hamlet'' option. Warbucks would remain applied and the player can start a ''Hamlet'' world as Warbucks.
* Warbucks' voice was played by a bugle.[^3]
* When Warbucks entered combat, his voice played to a tune similar to the finale of the ''[[Wikipedia:1812 Overture|1812 Overture]]'' by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. He was the only playable character with a unique battle cry.
* In the ''Hamlet'' beta, Warbucks had a base sanity of 300. This was changed to 200 in the early access release, likely for it to be more manageable.
* His title in the ''Hamlet'' beta was "The Gentleman Hunter". It was changed to "The Affluent Explorer" in the Early Access for ''Hamlet''.
* In a developer stream by Klei, it was said that some inspirations for his character included Van Pelt from ''Jumanji'' and Professor Archimedes Q. Porter from Disney's ''Tarzan''.
* In Art Stream #46, an unimplemented alternate design of Warbucks' character portrait was seen being used as a reference. A Shovel replaced the Blunderbuss

## Behavior

Shattered Spiders are hostile mobs exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in Return of Them. They are found exclusively on the Lunar Island spawning from Shattered Spider Holes. Just like regular spiders, these can be caught in traps, becoming an inventory item which can be "murdered" for the normal drops. Webber also can pick up spider to inventory.

They act similarly to Spiders, but have a larger aggro range and an attack where they slam the ground, causing 3-7 spikes to rupture and damaging an area in front of them. They currently have identical drops to a normal Spider, despite their stony appearance. If their attack hits a normal Spider or Spider Warrior, they aggro to each other. Just like with other Spiders, they can be befriended by Webber for one Meat item each.

## Usage

- Monster Meat, Silk, Spider Gland
- Spider Warrior
- Dangling Depth Dweller
- Cave Spider
- Spitter
- Nurse Spider
- Sea Strider

## Shadow Rift Content

If it gets caught in the Acid Rain, its damage attack will rise to +50%, move speed will rise to +15%, and taking damage decreases by -25%. The fact that it is subject to the effect can be understood by the special breath that it will emit.

## Trivia

- Shattered Spiders were introduced in the Turn of Tides update.
- During the Hallowed Nights event, Shattered Spiders can be obtained by using the Lunar Experiment on other Spiders.

Before moving to a country house, Wilson studied at a University. However, after an unknown incident, he was sent a bill that he was unable to pay.<sup>[1]</sup> Then he bought the house of a certain scientist at an auction. Previously it was the house where Wagstaff lived. There, he discovers a variety of items in the attic including Spectoggles, "Die Walküre" and a key. In the same place, he finds a gramophone and a skeleton under the boards, which was later hung in the corner of the house to study anatomy. Pulling back the closet, he notices the safe. Opening this safe with the key, he finds a Radio RP-76 there.

## Entering The Constant

<iframe width="300" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0QhvmisGWU" align="right"> </iframe>

The events of this short were later officially summarized in DST's Compendium:

> While toiling away in his home laboratory late one night, Wilson was startled to hear a voice on the radio speaking directly to him. At first he feared he'd gone mad from too many late nights of experiments and accidentally-inhaled chemical fumes, but the voice assured him that it was no mere figment of the imagination. In fact, the voice had a proposition for him: if Wilson would build a Maxwell's Door machine according to their specifications, then he would be rewarded with secret knowledge, the likes of which no one had ever seen. Casting aside his better judgement (after all, what harm could come from making a vague bargain with a mysterious disembodied voice?) Wilson threw himself into constructing the machine. When at long last it was finally completed, the gentleman scientist had a moment of hesitation... a moment that might have saved him from his impending fate, had he been just a bit stronger of will. But at the voice's insistence, Wilson flipped the switch and activated his creation... and was never seen again. Well, at least not in this world.

In 1921<sup>[2]</sup> living in a house far from the city and being depressed, he hears a voice from the radio that tells him. From him he hears these words: "Say pal, looks like you're having some trouble! I have secret knowledge I can share with you if you think you are ready for it." Wilson agrees and then hears from the radio: "Ok Then!". After that, Wilson receives the necessary knowledge and builds the portal according to the instructions from the radio. One of the main things he did was tying up rats, driving nails into boards, adding blood to a previously made liquid. After the radio says "Excellent! Now throw the switch." Wilson has little doubt about his actions. After shouting "DO IT!" from the radio. He presses the lever, after which the portal is activated and the shadowy hands steal Wilson. After Wilson gets into the Constant. All this time, Maxwell was talking through the radio.

## Wilson's Field Notes

Wilson's Field Notes are a series of blog posts written by Kevin on the (now-defunct) Don't Starve webpage. They detail some of Wilson's survival experiences, and were posted from June to July 2012. Due to the various changes the Don't Starve franchise has been through since, it's unknown if Wilson's Field Notes are canonical.

# For a list of all available structures, see [Structures](#).

## Structures

Structures are special objects that serve a passive purpose such as a [Wall] to defend or blockade an area, or an active purpose, such as a [Houndius Shootius] being used to protect an area against [mobs]. They are either crafted by the player or, more rarely, found around the world. They can be used to prevent any damage that is caused by mobs in the game.

## Structure Radius

When placed, every structure has a radius. Nothing new can be placed inside this radius unless the structure is destroyed. It doesn't take into account what is already there; it only counts the radius of the object being placed. For example, a [Chest] can be placed very close to an existing [Birdcage], but if a Birdcage is built near an existing Chest, it will need to be placed significantly farther away. 

The following are the radius values from the LUA files:

| Structure          | Radius  | Notes                  |
|-------------------|---------|-----------------------|
| Houndius Shootius  | 0.00    | Can be placed anywhere on valid ground. |
| Walls             | 0.10    | Distance from other walls. |
| Walls             | 1.00    | Distance from things that aren't walls. |
| Tooth Trap        | 0.75    |                         |
| Potted Fern       | 0.90    |                         |
| Chest             | 1.00    |                         |
| Bee Mine          | 0.75    |                         |
| Ice Box           | 1.50    |                         |
| Scaled Chest      | 1.50    |                         |
| Water Chest       | 1.00    |                         |
| Ballphin Palace   | 100.00  |                         |
| All Other Plantables | 2.00 | Things that can be items. |
| All Other Structures | 3.20 | Things that can't be items. |

**Note on Plantables vs Structures:** For the purposes of the table above, if it can be built and placed in the inventory, it's plantable. If it can be pre-built and placed later, it's a structure.

## {{pic|32|Prototype}} Tips

- To build many things in a small area, the player should prioritize structures with a large radius (For example, build Crockpots first, then Ice Boxes and finally Walls).

## Description

Iced Tea is a **Crock Pot** dish introduced in the **Hamlet** DLC, produced by combining two **Orange Pikos**, a **Sweetener**, and **Ice**. It also can be obtained by cooking **Tea** in the Crock Pot, and waiting a **Day** for it to cool down. When consumed, it restores 3 **HP**, 12.5 **Hunger** and 33 **Sanity**, lowers body temperature by 10 and increases Walking **Speed** by 1.67 (1/3 as much as **Coffee**) for 80 seconds. It takes 10 seconds to cook, and 6 **Days** to **spoil**.

## Prerequisites

- Requires: **File:Orange Piko.png|link=Orange Piko**
- Requires: **File:Sweetener.png|link=Sweetener**
- Requires: **File:Ice.png|link=Ice**

## Recipe

| Item       | Count |
|------------|-------|
| **Orange Piko** | 2 |
| **Sweetener** | 1 |
| **Ice** | 1 |

**Tool:** Crock Pot  
**Result:** Iced Tea

## Tips

- If opting for the second solution (to make normal Tea and wait a day), players should avoid putting the Tea in an **Ice Box**, since it will, paradoxically, make the cooling time twice as long.

## Trivia

- During the **Pig Fiesta** event, Iced Tea takes on a more festive appearance, looking like green tea.
- The use of **Orange Piko**s in making Tea and Iced Tea is a pun on **Wikipedia:Tea leaf grading#Orange_pekoe|orange pekoe tea**.
- Tea and Icedtea overrides the effect of coffee and each other respectively.

# Terraria

![DST Terraria Date](DST Terraria Date.jpg)

On October 21, 2021, Klei posted on the forums, as well as on Twitter, a teaser showing a pixelated Deerclops in the video game **Terraria**. Around the same time, Terraria released a teaser trailer showing Wilson being followed by the Eye of Cthulhu. The teasers hinted at a collaboration between Don't Starve and Terraria. Also before that, players on the Klei website were able to find a Clean Sweeper skin that referenced the Specter Paintbrush from Terraria. On November 18, 2021, an update appeared in Don't Starve Together adding things from Terraria and things from Don't Starve appeared in Terraria.

## Description
'''Research Notes''' are an **Item** exclusive to ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'', introduced in ''[[From Beyond]]''. It spawns along with the first set of **Abandoned Junk** structures a player encounters. When studying it, a page in the **Scrapbook** written by **Wagstaff** is added, listing all **Mobs** suspected to be viable hosts for the **Brightshade Gestalt**s.

## Scrapbook Info
"Day 56 - Lunar Mutations Study"

"It seems as though these strange entities that emerged from the rifts are in search of living hosts... or perhaps once living."

"NOTE: The following creatures warrant immediate study as I suspect they may be the most viable as hosts:"
- Frog
- Pengull
- Varg
- Koalefant
- Deerclops

"Other possible Rift entity host candidates:"
- Grass Gekko
- Hound
- Bearger
- Mosling

## Trivia
- Research Notes were introduced in the ''[[From Beyond#Host of Horrors|Host of Horrors]]'' update.
- As of the ''Host of Horrors'' update, a few of the creatures listed do not have lunar mutations:
  - Koalefant
  - Grass Gekko
  - Mosling
- The Hound and the Pengull have mutations ([[Horror Hound]] and [[Moonrock Pengull]]) that were present before Lunar Rifts were introduced.
