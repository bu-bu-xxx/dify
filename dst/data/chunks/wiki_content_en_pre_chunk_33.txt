# Marble Suit

## Overview
The **Marble Suit** is a wearable **Armor**, crafted in the **Fight Tab**. It requires 6 marble and 2 Ropes to craft and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype.

## Specifications
- **Tier**: 2
- **Filter**: [Armor Filter](#)
- **Ingredients**:
  - **Marble**: 6
  - **Rope**: 2
- **Perk**: Reduces speed by 30%.
- **Durability**: 735 hp
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "armormarble"
- **Dropped By**: [Ancient Pseudoscience Station](#) (Hammer)
- **Description**: It's heavy, but it will protect you.
- **Protection**: 95%

## Skins
- **Woven - Elegant Marble Plate Mail**
- **Marble Splint Armor**
- **Marble Victory Armor**

## Tips
- Due to its speed penalty, the Marble Suit is suited for tanking damage rather than kiting an opponent.
- Best suited for characters with low max health, such as **Maxwell**.
- Wearing a **Football Helmet** alongside the Marble Suit can increase its effective durability.
- **Wolfgang** is unaffected by the speed penalty while in his Mighty form, making it an ideal armor for him.

## Trivia
- Added in the **The End Is Nigh** update.
- Renewable, as Marble can be obtained from Earthquakes in Caves or mined from Marble Shrubs grown from Marble Beans.
- A character wearing a Marble Suit makes a small clanking noise when walking.
- In the May 28, 2020 patch for **Don't Starve Together**, the cost of the Marble Suit was cut in half to 6 marble and 2 rope.

The **Queen of Moon Quay** is an **NPC** exclusive to *Don't Starve Together* introduced in the *The Curse of Moon Quay* update. She lives on the **Moon Quay** along with **Powder Monkeys**, who reside in **Monkey Huts**.

### Banana Exchange
The Queen's primary purpose is to rid the player of **Accursed Trinkets** in exchange for **Bananas** and **Cooked Bananas**. If the player has any Accursed Trinkets in their inventory and a Banana is given to the Queen, she will remove 4 Trinkets from that player's inventory. This is the only way to get rid of Accursed Trinkets, besides dying.

If the player does not have any Accursed Trinkets on them and gives a Banana to the Queen, she will instead drop a random **Rare Blueprint** from a small selection consisting of the **Cannon Kit**, **Cannonball**, **Dock Kit**, **Dock Piling Kit** and **Moon Quay Beach Turf**. She will give one of each for the first five Bananas and a random Blueprint for every Banana afterwards.

She can also be presented with other non-Banana **Food** Items and **Trinkets**, which she promptly rejects.

### Right of Passage
Every time an exchange is made with the Queen she will activate the **Right of Passage** for 4 minutes. While the **Right of Passage** is active, Powder Monkeys on the Moon Quay become neutral to all players and will not attack players unless provoked.

The **Right of Passage** cannot be stacked and will always be reset to 4 minutes.

## Gramophone Quotes
### Receiving a Banana
- OOH, BENT GOLD.
- FABULOUS QUALITY.
- YOU'VE DONE WELL.

### Receiving a Banana from a Powder Monkey
- YOUR OFFERING PLEASES ME.
- THE GREAT SKY BANANA SMILES THIS DAY.

### Removing Accursed Trinkets
- YOU WOULD RETURN SUCH A GIFT? SUIT YOURSELF.
- YOU WISH TO RETURN TO THAT HIDEOUS FORM? VERY WELL.
- I CAN'T FATHOM WHY YOU'D GIVE IT UP, BUT I'LL HONOR OUR ACCORD.

### When waking
- WHAT'S ALL THE FUSS NOW?
- SPEAK. BUT MAKE IT QUICK.

- Eee

# Scaled Flooring

Don't Starve Together is a game that features different types of items and structures, one of which is **Scaled Flooring**. This is a craftable Turf that can be used to prevent the spread of fire. Here's a detailed description of Scaled Flooring in markdown format:

## Description

- **Icon**: ![Scaled Flooring](Scaled Flooring.png)

## Quotes

- **Wilson**: Do you want proof that it's fireproof?

- **Wolfgang**: Hot step stones.
- **Wendy**: Some ground.
- **WX-78**: CONDITION: INFLAMMABLE. WAIT. NOT FLAMMABLE?

- **Wanda**: This might actually be useful.

## Turf Infobox

- **Image**: ![Dragonfly Turf Texture](Dragonfly Turf Texture.png)
- **Pitchfork**: 1
- **Perk**: Slows the spreading of fire.

## Scrapbook Info

Scaled Flooring can be placed on dirt ground to change the type of ground.

## Details

Scaled Flooring is a craftable Turf in Don't Starve Together. It is crafted with Scales and a Cut Stone. Despite its fireproof qualities, Scaled Flooring can be used as fuel and can be lit on fire if left on the ground as an item. It helps decrease the amount of heat an object or structure absorbs from open fire sources, therefore slowing the spread of fire. However, this effect does not stop things from being ignited in the heat or manually lit on fire (such as with a torch). The effect is also only extended to objects and structures which are placed fully on top of them.

## Tips

Scaled Flooring can be used to duplicate Scales by using a Deconstruction Staff, since four Scaled Flooring are made each batch. This can be used to mass-produce Scales from at least one Scale.

# Mant Mask

Exclusive to **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC, the **Mant Mask** is a craftable Armor Item found in the Fight Tab. It requires 5 Chitin and 1 Football Helmet to craft, and a Science Machine to prototype.

## Item Infobox

- **Durability**: 450 HP / 10 Days
- **Perk**: 
- **Equip Slot**: Head
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "antmaskhat"
- **Ingredient 1**: Chitin
  - **Multiplier 1**: 5
- **Ingredient 2**: Football Helmet
  - **Multiplier 2**: 1
- **Tab**: Fight
- **Tier**: 1
- **Description**: A face only a Mant could love.

## Protection

The Mant Mask provides 80% protection against all physical damage.

## Durability and Repair

While being worn, the Mant Mask's durability will slowly decrease even when not taking damage, lasting a maximum of 10 Days if no damage is taken. A Sewing Kit will repair the Mant Mask by 50% Durability (225 HP).

## Disguise

When worn along with a Mant Suit, it allows the player to disguise among the Mants and make them neutral. They will still defend themselves if attacked, but this way they can be approached safely. However, Mant Warriors will not be fooled by the disguise.

## Tips

- Since the recipe accepts any durability Football Helmet, the Mant Mask is a good way to reuse old equipment.
- Sewing Kits can be used to repair Mant Masks and Mant Suits, unlike Football Helmets and Log Suits.
- Unlike the Football Helmet, the Mant Mask does **not** protect from Rain, so it may be better to keep a simple Football Helmet if it is heavily raining.

## Skins
- The '''<span style="color:#BD4646;">Woven - Elegant</span> Corrupted Blade''' skin was introduced during the official Year of the Carrot event in 2020.
- The '''<span style="color:#BD4646;">Woven - Elegant</span> Lightsbane''' skin was introduced in the An Eye for An Eye update in 2021, as a crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's Terraria. Its rarity was '''<span style="color:#BD4646;">Inspired - Elegant</span>''' initially, but received a change in August 19, 2022.
- The '''<span style="color:#BD4646;">Woven - Elegant</span> The Lamb's Blade''' skin was introduced in the Cult of the Lamb Crossover update in 2023, as a crossover collaboration with Cult of the Lamb. Collection: Flock's Collection

## Tips
- As Wanda, Dark Swords are best used when she is old, as she gains a 1.75x attack damage buff to Shadow Weapons. She also does not suffer from the Sanity drain.
- It is smart to use the Dark Sword on the Lunar Island to keep your Enlightenment low.

## Trivia
- The Dark Sword was added in the Insanity! update.
- The design of the Dark Sword appears to be a combination of Nightmare Fuel's visual elements and the shape of a [scimitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scimitar), a sword stereotypically used by Ottomans and relative Middle Eastern populace, originating in the 9th century (along with its usage seen in some parts of North India).
- Maxwell’s quote for the dark sword appears to a reference to the famous line from the poem [The Jabberwocky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberwocky) by Lewis Carroll.
- In the singleplayer game, Wilson's quote for the Dark Sword is "I dreamed it myself!", Willow's is "It's like my dreams can hurt real things!", and WX-78's is "I CAN HACK THIS WORLD".

The **Beefalo Hat** is a **Hat** **Item** found in the **Dress Tab**. It requires 8 **Beefalo Wool** and a **Beefalo Horn** to craft, and a **Science Machine** to prototype. The **Sewing Kit** repairs 50% of its durability.

It is a **tier 3** warm clothing, increasing the time a **character** can be without a heat source during the **Winter** before **Freezing**. It has an **insulation factor** of 240.

Wearing a Beefalo Hat will also cause **Beefalo** to regard the player with neutral behavior during mating season. If the parent of a **Baby Beefalo** is killed, and the player is wearing a Beefalo Hat, the baby may start to follow the player provided the player does not already have a follower.

## Downloadable Content
In **DLC**s, the Beefalo Hat provides 20% **water resistance** during **Rain**.

In the **Hamlet** DLC, Beefalo Hats can be bought for 10 **Oinc**s at **The Sow's Ear Hat Shop** in **Pig City**.

## Tips
* When the player is roaming around Beefalos or shaving them at night during mating season, it's advised to wear this hat to keep from being attacked.
* Players should take off the Hat when next to a fire (or replace it with a sanity-boosting hat) as the item's durability will go down if kept on, and the fire alone is enough to keep the character warm.

## Trivia
* This item used to increase the player's **Sanity** per minute by a slight amount of points.
* The previous crafting description ("And you thought they smelled bad on the outside") was a reference to **Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back**, when Han Solo cuts open a Tauntaun to keep Luke Skywalker warm, he says, "And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!".
* Despite having two horns on it, the hat only takes one **Beefalo Horn** to craft.

# Trinkets

## Navigation
- [Don't Starve](Trinkets)
- [DST](Trinkets/DST)

## Overview
![Trinkets](Trinkets.png)
**Trinkets** are a group of **Items** that can be found around the Constant through various means such as digging up **Grave**s using a **Shovel**, picking **Tumbleweed**s, befriending **Catcoons**, smashing **Ancient Pseudoscience Station** with hammer.

Generally, the only use for Trinkets in **Don't Starve** is to be traded to the **Pig King** or **Yaarctopus** in exchange for **Gold Nugget**s, and for decoration.

Some trinkets have special uses in DLCs:
- The **Can of Silly String** is used to craft the **Skyworthy**.

## Trivia
- Under the old research method, Trinkets were one of the best ways of gaining research points (80 points).
- The reason these items are known as "trinkets" is due to their spawn code names ("trinket_1", "trinket_2", etc.).
- One True Earring, based on the name and offering the highest appeasement to the Volcano Altar of Snackrifice, may be a reference to The Lord of the Rings, where the evil could only be vanquished by casting the One Ring into Mount Doom.
- Appeasing the Volcano with the Orange Soda may be a reference to the movie Joe Versus the Volcano, where the natives of a tropical island drink large amounts of orange soda while asking Tom Hanks' character to voluntarily jump into an active volcano.
- The Brain Cloud Pill is also most likely a reference to the film, as Tom Hanks' character is claimed to have a fictitious terminal illness called a brain cloud by

The **Construction Amulet** is a craftable item found in the Ancient Tab. It requires 1 Green Gem, 3 Nightmare Fuel, and 2 Thulecite, and at least a Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft. It can also randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when damaged. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Construction Amulets cannot be prototyped and characters always need to be near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station to craft them again.

## Scrapbook Info

Halves the cost of crafted items and raises sanity when worn.

## Common Uses

| Item | Base Cost | Cost with amulet | Net Cost | Net Savings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deconstruction Staff | 2x Green Gem, 2x Living Log, 4x Nightmare Fuel | 1.2x Green Gem, 0.4x Thulecite, 1x Living Log, 2.6x Nightmare Fuel | 0.4x Thulecite | 0.8x Green Gem, 1x Living Log, 1.4x Nightmare Fuel |
| Star Caller's Staff | 2x Yellow Gem, 2x Living Log, 4x Nightmare Fuel | 1x Yellow Gem, 0.2x Green Gem, 0.4x Thulecite, 1x Living Log, 2.6x Nightmare Fuel | 0.2x Green Gem, 0.4x Thulecite | 1x Yellow Gem, 1x Living Log, 1.4x Nightmare Fuel |
| Thulecite Suit | 6x Thulecite, 4x Nightmare Fuel | 0.2x Green Gem, 3.4x Thulecite, 2.6x Nightmare Fuel | 0.2x Green Gem | 2.6x Thulecite, 1.4x Nightmare Fuel |

## Tips

Since Green Gems are so rare, the best use for Construction Amulets is to craft items that require very rare or non-renewable materials (i.e., items from the Ancient Tab).

## Trivia

The Construction Amulet shares the same in-game model with the Life Giving Amulet but its gem is green instead of red.

## Bugs

When left with only 20% durability remaining (its last use), the Amulet's effect will only partially work. The amulet will properly allow the player to completely build something with only the first half

The Coconade is a throwable Weapon introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It requires 1 Coconut, 1 Gunpowder, and 1 Rope to craft and a Science Machine to prototype. A Coconade can be used as a ranged explosive weapon or it can be used as a placed explosive like Gunpowder. Coconades are possible rewards from X Marks the Spot treasure Chests, and can also be found in Steamer Trunks.

When one explodes, a Coconade deals 250 damage to any Mobs and destroys Structures within a 6 unit radius (1.5 Pitchfork tiles). Note that since mobs killed by either type of Coconade are considered to have been on fire when they died, any flammable items they drop will turn into Ashes.

## Obsidian Coconade

### Item Infobox
- **Name**: Obsidian Coconade
- **Perk**: Explodes and sets nearby targets on fire.
- **Damage**: 340
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "obsidiancoconade"
- **Ingredients**:
  - Coconade: 3
  - Obsidian: 3
  - Dragoon Heart: 1
- **Num to Give**: 3
- **Tab**: Volcanic
- **Tier**: 8

The Obsidian Coconade is a stronger and more expensive version of the Coconade exclusive to the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It requires 3 Coconades, 3 Obsidian, and a Dragoon Heart to craft, and may also be found in X Marks the Spot treasure Chests. Like all items in the Volcanic Tab, it cannot be prototyped and the player must be standing near an Obsidian Workbench or be wearing a Brain of Thought to craft it again.

When it explodes, an Obsidian Coconade deals 340 damage and destroy structures within a 9 unit radius (2.25 Pitchfork tiles).

## Hamlet DLC

In the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, regular Coconades can be bought for 20 Oincs at The Boar's Tusk Weapon Shop in the Pig City. Coconades can be used to destroy Ancient Pig Ruins and are capable of instantly killing the Pugalisk boss if aimed well.

## Tips

- Effects of worn Armor apply to a Coconade exploding inside the inventory meaning it can be used as a last resort if the player is being overwhelmed by hostile mobs.
- Coconades can one-shot the Pugalisk with the correct placement.
- When used in conjunction with a Pan Flute, a single Coconade can wipe out an entire wave of Crocodogs. This is especially useful when sailing in a damaged boat far from land or friendly Bottlenose Ballphins (often when exiting the Volcano after days inside).
- Coconades are much more effective when lit in the inventory then thrown due to

## Scrapbook Info
You have to catch it once you throw it.

The Boomerang is a craftable Ranged Weapon. It requires 1 Boards, 1 Silk, and 1 Charcoal to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

The Boomerang returns to the player after being thrown. The player must catch it by holding down the action key (default Space key) while it is on its way back. If it isn't caught after being thrown, it will hit the player, causing damage and losing twice the durability on return, and the player will have to pick it up from the ground in order to use it again.

## Tips
- The player can have more than one Boomerang out at a time. The action key must be held for each returning Boomerang, however.
- The Boomerang kills Rabbits and Birds in one throw (except for characters who don't hit as hard, such as Wendy and Wes), making it a great tool for gathering Morsels and Feathers. However, nearby Rabbits and Birds will run away after a death, and additionally, killing them raises the player's naughtiness.
- Birds are perhaps more preferable to kill with a Boomerang since Rabbits can still be caught easily with other means such as Traps, and the objects needed to craft items to kill birds are more demanding than Rabbit Traps.
- When playing as Wolfgang, he may do more or less damage depending on his hunger level, or mightiness in DST. He also receives the same damage multiplier from uncaught Boomerangs.
- The Boomerang serves much the same purpose on the console versions of the game, though because of the auto targeting system, it is not a recommended weapon. One must not stand near anything interactive (Grass, Flowers, Flint, etc.) and wait for the Boomerang to be selected on its way back before quickly pressing "X" to catch it. This can be hard to do, and if the player's health is too low, it can easily cause death.
- Because of the low damage, the easy to craft recipe, and durability the Boomerang is most useful at aggroing fast mobs such as Koalefant and Volt Goats or to kill Birds and Rabbits.

## Trivia
- If the player dies from being struck by a Boomerang, the Morgue will show the Character's name under "Cause of Death".
- The Boomerang's description ("It comes from a land down under.") is a reference to Australia's nickname, the "Land Down Under", and also to a famous song by the Australian band Men at Work.
- Being struck by a Boomerang while on a

## Behavior
Crabbits are passive Mobs found in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. They act much like Rabbits. If they are approached, they will attempt to flee the player. Unlike Rabbits, they will not try to immediately return to their home. If chased for too long, or hit enough times without being killed, they will bury themselves into the ground, protected from all weapons, and create Shifting Sands. When killed, a Crabbit will drop 1 Fish Morsel. A Crabbit can be trapped by putting food such as Limpets in a Trap and waiting, or like Rabbits, chased into them. When used in a Crock Pot, a Crabbit provides 0.5 Fish value. It cannot be given to the Yaarctopus.

## Hunting
A Crabbit can most easily be caught with a Trap placed over or near its den. This will guarantee that when a Crabbit emerges it will be caught. When a Crabbit is chased for too long, it will burrow into the ground, creating Shifting Sands. It is also easy to place a trap on top of the Shifting Sands in order to instantly trap the Crabbit. The player may also dig up the Shifting Sands using a Shovel to force the Crabbit back out where it will be vulnerable to attacks, but there is a chance the Crabbit will escape, resulting in Sand instead of a live Crabbit.

## Usage
Crabbits are a way of converting abundant Monster Meat into somewhat

# Lantern

## Overview

The **Lantern** is a portable, refuellable light source that can be either equipped or placed on the ground to provide light. It requires 2 Light Bulbs, 3 Twigs, and 2 Ropes to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The Lantern at full durability has the same light radius as a miner hat, therefore it is ideal for spelunking.

## Crafting and Usage

- **Crafting Ingredients:**
  - 2x Light Bulb
  - 3x Twigs
  - 2x Rope
- **Fuel Options:**
  - Light Bulbs: 19% refuel, lasts for 90 seconds
  - Fireflies: 39% refuel, lasts for 180 seconds
  - Slurtle Slime: 9.5% refuel, lasts for 45 seconds
- **Durability:** Does not disappear when durability reaches 0%, but needs refueling to provide light again.
- **Combat Usage:** Can be used as a weapon, dealing damage equivalent to a character's fist (10 damage for normal damage multiplier characters).

## Skins

A **Mandrake** is a passive **Mob** found in **Mandrake Forests**. They are very rare and only 2-5 Mandrakes will spawn per **World**. They usually spawn in the same area and always on **Grass Turf**. No Mobs will eat Mandrakes that are still planted in the ground.

Mandrakes cannot be grown and there is no way to get more live Mandrakes. The player can only get Mandrake as an item from the **Loot Stash**, which spawns every Winter.

With normal damage modifiers, it takes one hit from a **Spear** to kill a Mandrake (any version of an **Axe** or **Pickaxe** will do the same). All forms of the Mandrakes are completely immune to fire and cannot be set on fire.

### Behavior
When picked at **Dusk** or **Night**, it will turn into a living Mandrake, following the player around, even through **Wormholes**, and constantly making noise until morning, when it will replant itself on the spot. Like **Pig**, it will back away when the player gets too close. The player can chase and kill it, and the mandrake will die and become an item.

When picked during the **Day**, it will die instantly and can be collected as an item.

# Backstep Watch

### Exclusivity
Don't Starve Together

### Structure Infobox
- **Cooldown**: 2 sec
- **Name**: Backstep Watch
- **Icon**: ![Backstep Watch](Backstep Watch.png)
- **Description**: Retrace your last steps.
- **Ingredient 1**: Time Pieces (x1)
- **Ingredient 2**: Gold Nugget (x2 for Wanda only)
- **Filter**: Survivor Items Filter
- **Tier**: 0
- **Perk**: Teleport to a few steps before.
- **Stack**: Does not stack
- **Spawn Code**: "pocketwatch_warp"

### Quotes

- **Willow**: Why worry about the past or future? It'll all go up in flames eventually.
- **Wolfgang**: Is just little clock.
- **Wendy**: It's soothing to watch the seconds tick away.

- **Wickerbottom**: Horology mixed with magic, truly fascinating.
- **Woodie**: That's a pretty fancy lookin' clock.
- **Maxwell**: Careful, madam. I know where this trail ultimately leads.

- **Wurt**: Only chewed on it little bit! But Wandy-lady got mad...
- **Walter**: Ms. Wanda sure has a lot of clocks!
- **Wanda**: It's perfect for short trips, no muss or fuss.

### Scrapbook Info
The Backstep Watch teleports Wanda to the location marked on the ground. The younger Wanda is, the further back in time the marked location will be. Wanda is invulnerable for a short time during the teleport. 2 second cooldown.

- **Young Wanda**: Teleports 16 units
- **Middle-Aged Wanda**: Teleports 8 units
- **Old Wanda**: Teleports 4 units

Upon use, the Backstep Watch provides a generous amount of invulnerability, making it an excellent combat tool to dodge enemy attacks. The invulnerability does not start immediately, so it should be used around half a second before being hit.

The Backstep Watch only stores a limited number of steps before being unusable. This backstep 'storage' is also influenced by age:

- **Young Wanda**: Stores 8 backsteps
- **Middle-Aged Wanda**: Stores 16 backsteps
- **Old Wanda**: Stores 32 backsteps

Once the maximum number of backsteps has been reached, Wanda will state "That's enough backtrecking for now." Backstep storage is reset to 0 upon transporting shards.

### Crafting Requirements
- **Time Pieces**: 1
- **Gold Nugget**: 2 (for Wanda only)

### Trivia
Unlike the Backtrek watch, the Backstep Watch cannot transport you between shards (surface/caves).

# Masks and Costumes in Don't Starve Together

Masks and Costumes are items needed to perform on stage. Performances require performers, be they players or Mannequins, to wear a matching mask and costume. Both items are dropped by the Briar Wolves which spawn in a specific set piece consisting of four of them surrounding an Overgrown Statue. Between them, the wolves drop two random costume sets when defeated, and respawn after a day. All masks and costumes can be burned.

## Play

### Act 1
According to the script, a porcelain Doll came to life. She decides to explore the world. The Blacksmith who cared for her before she came alive takes her under her wing. She protects the Doll and creates a heavy armor that cracks her (After this, the mask on the player turns from Doll Mask to Cracked Doll Mask). The Doll escapes and meets the King, who creates wonderful things with the help of magic. After which the King offers to travel with her. The Doll agrees and asks the King to teach her magic.

### Act 2
For a long time, the Doll traveled with the King. She often asked the king to teach her magic, but the king always gave different excuses. Then she finds a Mirror in a secret room in the royal castle. The Mirror admits that the King stole their power. The Mirror wants to gain freedom and the Doll decides to help. The King learns that his secret has been revealed and panics. The Mirror tells the King that the King did not keep his end of their deal. The King makes an explosion which causes the Doll to split even more (Cracked Doll changes to Shattered Doll) and disappears with his magic.

The Doll wakes up. The Mirror gives all of their remaining power to the doll. The Doll finds the King cowering behind his throne in his castle. The King asks to leave him alone, coming up with excuses for this. The Doll asks for the King's power to heal herself and the Mirror. The King disappears with his throne to where he hopes the doll will not find him.

### Act 3
The Doll finds the Fool singing. She decides to shadow him to find the King. The Fool finds the King and accidentally knocks him over. The King's fragile body turns to dust, and the Fool appoints themselves king. The Doll removes the Fool from the throne and becomes the Queen.(Shattered Doll Mask turns into Queen Mask. Doll Costume turns into Queen Costume)
The new Queen asks the Mirror why they are still broken. The Mirror says that they were broken long before the King stole their power. The Queen promises to fix them someday, and the play ends.

### Explanation
The play is a representation of Charlie's backstory before she became the ruler of the Constant. Each costume represents a major player in her story:
- The Doll represents Charlie herself.
- The Blacksmith represents Winona. The heavy armor the Blacksmith gives to the Doll likely represents Winona's over-protectiveness.
- The King represents Maxwell. His magic blast likely represents Maxwell sending Charlie into the Constant.
- The Mirror represents Them. The King stealing the Mirror's power likely represents Them granting Maxwell shadow magic, and the Mirror reviving the Doll likely represents Them turning Charlie into the Night Monster.
- The Fool represents Wilson. Their appointing themselves king likely represents the events at the end of Adventure Mode.

# Frostjaw

The Frostjaw is a Boss exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**. It is a large humanoid shark with icy features. It can be spawned from the Ice Fishing Hole on the Ice Sheet, which is in the Rough Ocean.

## Behavior
By default, the Frostjaw is passive towards the player and simply walks around. Once attacked, it becomes aggressive and starts fighting. It has 3 attacks rotating in this order:

1. It performs a melee attack with 2 swipes, followed by a third swipe with its tail which knocks targets back.
2. It summons 2 walls of Ice Spikes in the direction of the target and dives between the walls, dealing damage and knocking targets back.
3. It swims under the ice with its fin visible on the surface, and torpedoes out of it to hit its target, knocking them back and drilling back into the ground.

## Fighting Strategy
The Frostjaw's 3-hit combo attack can be avoided by circling around it. Moving quickly away to the sides can allow the player to avoid being trapped between the walls of ice. If the Frostjaw performs its dive bomb attack, make as much distance as possible between yourself and where its fin disappeared below the ice.

## Quotes
- When Idling: "HUH? WHAT HAPPENED?", "HEY! WHATSA MATTER WITH YOU?", "I FEEL LIKE A FISH OUTTA WATER...", etc.
- While fighting: "TOUGH GUY, EH?", "YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME, SEE.", "IT'S BITIN' TIME!", etc.
- Giving up once defeated: "I BIT OFF MORE THAN I CAN CHEW.", "I WAS OUTTA MY DEPTH.", "UNCLE! UNCLE!", etc.

## Ice Spike
Ice Spike or Ice is an object exclusive to Don't Starve Together. It is spawned by the Frostjaw during its dive attack, and remains indefinitely until it melts or gets destroyed. It can be mined with a Pickaxe, dropping 1 Ice with a 75% chance for a second Ice.

## Trivia
- The Frostjaw was introduced in the Skill Spotlight Update.
- In beta after defeat, it dropped 2 Bootleg Getaways with a 50% chance for a third one.

# Gunpowder

![Gunpowder](Gunpowder%20Dropped.png)

Gunpowder is an explosive [Weapon] that requires 1 [Rotten Egg], 1 [Charcoal], and 1 [Nitre] to craft and an [Alchemy Engine] to prototype. Rotten [Egg]s are produced by waiting for Eggs to rot, and can usually be found in [Pengull] nests sometime after [Winter] ends. [Charcoal] can be obtained by burning trees. [Nitre] is dropped from mining [Boulders], or by digging up [Moleworm] burrows.

## Description

A handful of gunpowder.

## Ingredients

- [Rotten Egg] (x1)
- [Charcoal] (x1)
- [Nitre] (x1)

## Stats

- Tier: 2
- Damage: 200
- Stack: 40
- Spawn Code: "gunpowder"

## Quotes

- Wilson: It looks like pepper.
- Willow: Oooooooooh! Shiny!
- Wolfgang: Boom pepper!
- Wendy: It is a dark path I tread.
- WX-78: PUTS THE "POW" IN "POWDER"
- Wickerbottom: Knowledge is power!
- Woodie: Never did like this stuff.
- Maxwell: Now this I like.
- Wigfrid: Such energy!
- Webber: We're getting good at making stuff.
- Warly: Boom!
- Wormwood: BOOM!
- Winona: For when you need a big KABOOM!
- Wortox: I'll spell your doom with a mighty BOOM!
- Wurt: Splodey powder.
- Walter: I better make sure none of the younger kids play with this.
- Wanda: There's an infinite number of ways this could go very badly.

## Usage

Gunpowder can be used to kill some Bosses or mobs. However, exploding Gunpowders can set them on fire, turning their valuable drops into ashes. Gunpowder sinks in the water, meaning it cannot be used to fight [Malbatross] and [Crab King] without sacrificing a boat, unless using [Ice Flingomatic] or other methods to put out fire.

## Explosive Resistance

Some Bosses gain a temporary resistance to explosive damage when they receive it within a short time span. This resistance will fade away if no additional explosive damage occurs within 10 seconds.

### Monsters with resistance

- Ancient Fuelweaver
- Bearger
- Bee Queen
- Celestial Champion
- Crab King
- Deerclops
- Dragonfly
- Klaus
- Moose/Goose
- Shadow Knight
- Shadow Bishop
- Shadow Rook
- Toadstool
- Nightmare Werepig
- Scrapy Werepig
- Eye of Terror
- Retinazor
- Spazmatism
- Malbatross

### Formula

Explosions add `<code>(Explosion Damage / 8000) * 100%</code>` Explosive Resistance.

- Each Gunpowder adds `2.5%` Explosive Resistance.
- Each [Slurtle Slime] adds `0.625%` Explosive Resistance.
- Explosive Resistance remains at full strength for `2 seconds` and then decays by `12.5% per second`.
- It takes a total of `10 seconds` for Explosive Resistance to decay from 100% to 0%.

### Recipe

1 Gunpowder + 2 Cut Stone = 4 Cannonballs (Blueprint required)

## Trivia

- Gunpowder was added in '[Don't Starve/Version History#A Little Rain Must Fall|A Little Rain Must Fall]' update.
- In earlier versions of the game, Gunpowder explosions in [Caves] could cause [Earthquake]s.
- Gunpowder can be set off by [Moleworms].
- Gunpowder explosions have the same lighting effect as a [Lightning] strike.
- Real-life black powder is made by combining charcoal (carbon), nitre (potassium nitrate), and sulfur which is mistakenly believed to smell like rotten eggs (an average egg contains about 0.2 milligrams of sulfur).
- Realistically, a pile of gunpowder would only burn, not explode. It needs to be contained (like inside a [Coconade|coconut]) to allow pressure to build.

## Description

'''Cut Grass''' is a [[Renewable resources|renewable]] resource [[Item]] harvested from [[Grass Tuft]]s found naturally in the world. It can be used on numerous starter recipes and in even more advanced items when refined into [[Rope]].

Because Cut Grass is needed to craft [[Campfire]]s and [[Torch]]es, it is a valuable early-game resource to collect. A player who does not collect cut grass on their first day may have no means for making a fire at night.

In [[Seasons/Winter|Winter]], Cut Grass becomes a non-renewable resource, as harvested Grass Tufts will not regrow until Winter ends.

Cut Grass can be fed to [[Beefalo]] to restore 10 [[Health]] and 10 [[Hunger]].

## Downloadable Content

In all [[DLC]]<nowiki/>s, more crafting recipes require Cut Grass. Cut Grass can also be gained from crops on a [[Farm]] that is destroyed by the heat during [[Summer]] or [[Dry Season]]. Grass Tufts wither during these seasons unless protected by an [[Ice Flingomatic]] or located in a [[Mangrove]] biome, reducing access to Cut Grass.

In the ''[[Reign of Giants]]'' DLC, Cut Grass drops from all [[Tumbleweed]]s, making it renewable even if the player burns all the spawned Grass Tufts.

In the ''[[Shipwrecked]]'' DLC, Cut Grass and Grass Tufts appear greener, however their function is identical. Cut Grass may be dropped by the [[Slot Machine]] when three carrots are rolled.

In the ''[[Hamlet]]'' DLC

# Snortoise

## Mob Information
- **Health**: 2550
- **Damage**: 50, 25 (Spin)
- **Spawns from**: ![Forge Portal](Forge Portal.png)
- **Spawn Code**: Cannot be spawned
- **Exclusive to**: Don't Starve Together
- **Event**: The Forge

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: "Its shell is so spiky!"
- **Willow**: "Hey! How am I s'pose to hit you with all that armor?"
- **Wolfgang**: "Armor is for tiny men!"
- **Wendy**: "You cannot shield yourself from this world."
- **WX-78**: "I AM THE SUPERIOR METAL BEING"
- **Wickerbottom**: "Best steer clear of those spikes, dear."
- **Woodie**: "Gotta keep that one from hiding, eh?"
- **Maxwell**: "He's rather thick-headed."
- **Wigfrid**: "Yöur armör shalln't stöp my spear."
- **Webber**: "That turtle's huge!"
- **Winona**: "Steel yourself, turtle."

## Behavior and Tips
The Snortoise is a hostile mob found in the "The Forge" event of "Don't Starve Together". They are the third creature encountered in The Forge and are one of the strongest regular mobs. Snortoises have metal armor covered in spikes on their shells.

### Attacks
1. **Spike Extension**: Causes damage to all players in the area around them.
2. **Spin Attack**: After getting low on health, they hide in their shell and spin around the arena. They are immune to damage during this attack, unless interrupted by certain weapon specials or WX-78's passive electrical damage.

### Strategies
- Snortoises are vulnerable to the Pyre Poker attack from the Pith Pike, which immobilizes them.
- Focus on one Snortoise at a time to avoid multiple spinning Snortoises damaging the party.
- Various attacks and items can stop spinning Snortoises, including Darts, Molten Bolts, Cataclysm Meteors, Anvil Strikes, WX-78's passive electric attacks, Maxwell's Shadow Duelists, Wigfrid's Battle Cry buffed Spiral Spear drill, and chucking a Riled Lucy.
- A Life Blossom from the Living Staff can put spinning Snortoises to sleep if they pass through it without being fired upon.

## Trivia
- The Snortoise's spawn code is "turtillus", but it cannot be spawned in the regular game.
- Snortoises were originally called Tortanks, possibly due to copyright issues.
- The Tortank/Snortoise's original design was based on a reskinned Beefalo.

In ''Don't Starve Together'', large Fishes and Leafy Meat count as 1.0 unit of Meat, therefore Meat is no longer a strict requirement for the recipe.

## Prerequisites
- Requires: [Meats](Meats Crock Pot.png)
- Excludes: [Twigs](Twigs.png) [Honey](Honey.png) [Tallbird Egg](Tallbird Egg.png) [Mandrake](Mandrake.png)

## Recipe
### Cookbook

- **Count 1**: 3.0
- **Item 2**: Filler
- **Tool**: Crock Pot
- **Result**: Meaty Stew

### Examples
1. **Meat**, **Monster Meat**, **Morsel** (x2)
2. **Meat** (x2), **Monster Meat**, **Carrot**
3. **Meat**, **Monster Meat**, **Egg**
4. **Normal Meats** (x3), **Ice** (Reign of Giants DLC)

## Trivia
- Meaty Stew shares its texture with the removed Deadly Feast food item.

# Elastispacer

- **Ingredients**:
  - **Scrap**: 4 (multiplier1)
  - **Pure Brilliance**: 2 (multiplier2)

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: The laws of physics are surprisingly flexible.
- **Willow**: More space to stash stuff? Sounds good to me!
- **Wolfgang**: Makes trunk bigger? Hmm, does little machine work on muscles?
- **Wendy**: It makes the emptiness in my chest grow even bigger...
- **WX-78**: OH. YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.
- **Wickerbottom**: Increases the capacity of a storage container by a, frankly, absurd degree.

- **Wigfrid**: Be this science or witchcraft?
- **Webber**: Will this make our toy chest bigger?
- **Warly**: Ah! Can this give me the storage space I crave?
- **Wormwood**: Make space streeeetch!
- **Winona**: Looks like something the bossman would've come up with.
- **Wortox**: Now that's bending the rules a little, hyuyu!
- **Wurt**: Make boxes bigger? Glurgh. More fun to leave stuff on ground.
- **Walter**: I can make room for supplies!
- **Wanda**: More space is always welcome, but more time would be preferred.
- **Choose**: Winona

The Elastispacer is an item exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **From Beyond**. It allows players to increase the stack size of **Chest**s and **Scaled Chest**s.

The rare **Blueprint** for prototyping the Elastispacer may drop from **Abandoned Junk**. It is found in the **Storage Solutions Filter** and requires 4 **Scrap**, 2 **Pure Brilliance** and an **Enlightened Shard** to craft.

After using the Elastispacer on a Chest, any stackable item will have its stack size limit increased to practically infinite (4,294,967,296), but it will only show "999+" when it contains more than 999 items. The upgraded Chest differs from the usual one in its very elongated model, as well as a golden frame in the UI design of the inventory.

Taking items stacked beyond their limit out of the chest will give one regular stack at a time, instead of the entire amount of said items.

## Usage
### Recipes
- **Chest + Elastispacer** = Tall Chest
- **Scaled Chest + Elastispacer** = Tall Scaled Chest

## Trivia
- The Elastispacer was introduced in the **Scrappy Scavengers** update.

### Hamlet

The Snakeskin Jacket is also included in the Hamlet DLC, however, it has a very different appearance as Snakeskin is obtained from Vipers. It is especially useful by offering protection against Lightning strikes produced by Thunderbirds.

### Trivia

- Based on character examination quotes, the Snakeskin Jacket seems to have the same consistency of a leather jacket, explaining its mild insulation and high wetness protection.
- The jacket appears to be sleeveless, as the characters appear to have their arms in the back, and the item itself has no sleeves.

## Scrapbook Info
The Fencing Sword rotates rotatable structures like fences, signs, and chairs.

## Description
The Fencing Sword is a Melee Weapon and Tool. It requires 2 Flint and 1 Spear to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

The Fencing Sword deals the same amount of damage as the Spear (34), but has more Durability than the Spear (at around 200). It has a greatly reduced attack speed. It can also be used to rotate fences and directional signs.

## Tips
- The Fencing Sword's reduced attack speed can be mostly negated by moving slightly after attacking.

## Trivia
- The Fencing Sword uses the Spear's unused "Spear Jab" animation, where the character lunges forward with the weapon to poke the enemy.
- The Fencing Sword was introduced alongside Wickerbottom's Character Update.

- **Wanda:** Quite the afternoonified rain napper, isn't it?

## Usage

The Pretty Parasol is a Survival item. Like an Umbrella, it negates Sanity loss caused by Rain when equipped. If playing as WX-78, the Pretty Parasol will prevent damage caused by Rain and prevent being struck by Lightning.

## Crafting

It requires 4 Twigs, 3 Cut Grass, and 6 Petals to craft and is available from the beginning of the game. It can also be used as Fuel, providing the same burn time as a Log.

## DLC Content

In DLCs, the Pretty Parasol slows the rate at which the player gains Wetness by 50% and provides moderate protection from Overheating. It will no longer prevent WX-78 from being struck by Lightning.

In the Shipwrecked and Hamlet DLCs, only Wagstaff can construct the Pretty Parasol.

## Recipe

- **Item 1:** Pretty Parasol (Count: 1)
- **Item 2:** Electrical Doodad (Count: 1)
- **Result:** Telebrella
- **Character:** Wagstaff

## DST Skins

In Don't Starve Together, Skins can be applied to certain items to change their appearance. Information on how to obtain specific skins can be found on the Belongings page.

## Tips

Due to its cheap cost, as a temporary measure, it can be an effective alternative to the Umbrella in Spring.

## Trivia

- The Pretty Parasol was first introduced in the Reign of Giants DLC and was also present in the Hamlet DLC. It was then added to the base game in the Hamlet Early Access beta branch on April 18, 2019.
- The Pretty Parasol is unavailable for crafting in the Shipwrecked DLC unless playing as Wagstaff, which instead has the Tropical Parasol.

**Marsh Turf** is one of the **Turf** **items**, acquired by digging **Marsh** tiles with a **Pitchfork**. These turfs can commonly be found at the **Marsh** biome and rarely at the **Mosaic** biome. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile, or it can be used as a good burning fuel for a **Campfire** or **Fire Pit**.

Plants like **Berry Bush**es, **Grass Tuft**s, **Saplings**, **Spiky Bush**es, **Lureplant**s, **Pine Cone**s, and **Birchnut**s can be planted on these Turfs. It will not stop Lureplants' **Eyeplant**s from spawning.

When placed on the **Surface World** covering a large enough area, Crows are the only **Birds** that will spawn and land on these turfs.

If brought to **Shipwrecked**, floods can spawn on this turf.

### Trivia
- As of the **It's Not A Rock** update, this is the only natural Turf that is renewable in **Don't Starve**.

# Year of the Pig King

![Year of the Pig King Promo](Year of the Pig King Promo.jpg)

### Dates
- **2019:** January 24 - March 7

### Developer
- **Klei Entertainment**

### Preceded by
- **Year of the Varg**

### Succeeded by
- **Year of the Carrat**

**Year of the Pig King** is an event in *Don't Starve Together* that began on January 24, and ended on March 7, 2019. It is inspired by the Chinese Year of the Pig, which starts from February 5, 2019, and ends on January 24, 2020. In the Chinese zodiac, each year is related to an animal in a 12-year cycle.

It is similar to the Year of the Gobbler and the Year of the Varg events, which came in the years before, and shares mechanics with them, such as the Offerings crafting tab, and most craftable items from those events. However, there are several additions and differences implemented into this event, especially concerning the obtainment of Lucky Gold Nuggets. Players can revisit this event by setting *Events* to *Year of the Pig King* in the World Customization menu.

During the official Year of the Pig King event, the Pig King Hat Skin was given to players upon opening the game. Spring Chests had a chance of dropping in place of Classy items as part of the weekly skin drops.

## Scrapbook Info

Automatically picks up items nearby and puts them in your inventory. Also raises sanity when worn.

## Tips

- The Lazy Forager can be used to pick up the rare items from Cave Holes. New treasures spawn in the Cave Holes every time the Ruins are reset.
- The Lazy Forager can be used to collect Salt Crystals that drop out of pickup range near mined Salt Formations. This can make it less tedious to manoeuver around the mined Salt Formations each time the player wants to collect the Salt Crystals.
- Similarly, any items floating in the ocean out of the players reach can be retrieved with The Lazy Forager.
- During the Pig King Wrestling Match in DST, the Lazy Forager will automatically pick up any Gold Nuggets, whether dropped by the Pig King or by the player himself.
- Despite being refuellable, The Lazy Forager will still break at 0%, so care must be taken.
- The Lazy Forager will not count full stacks as one item when reducing durability - instead, it will pull one piece out of the stack at a time. It will also pick up any Traps, Tooth Traps, or Bee Mines nearby (except Bramble Trap).
- The Lazy Forager can be used to aid in clearing out landspace to expand the player's base. It will automatically pick up any Turfs, Logs, Saplings, Rocks and other resources that are dropped when clearing out various naturally spawned obstacles.

## Trivia

- The Lazy Forager shares the same in-game model with the Chilled Amulet but its gem is orange instead of blue.
- This item used to be a part of the Gemology Tab before the Tab was removed from the game.
