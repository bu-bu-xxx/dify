# Beefalo Horn

![Beefalo Horn](/Beefalo Horn Dropped.png)
The **Beefalo Horn** is an **Item** dropped 33% of the time after killing a [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo). When blown, the Beefalo Horn uses 10% of its durability and causes up to 5 grown Beefalo to follow the character for the rest of the current day or until they meet up with the player, as at night Beefalo will stop following and go to sleep. They will move at their walking speed and will not fight hostile creatures the way that following [Pigs](/wiki/Pig) do. Baby Beefalo still follow their parents, which means that they will also move; however, the Horn will not cause them to leave their parents.

## Quotes
- **Wilson**: It sounds like a beefalo field in there.
- **Willow**: I can hear those hairy beasts inside.
- **Wolfgang**: Is hair-cow horn. Wolfgang hear hair-cow.
- **Wendy**: It sounds like there's a beefalo trapped inside.
- **WX-78**: UNHYGIENIC
- **Wickerbottom**: What an excellent specimen! I can almost hear the beefalo.
- **Woodie**: I don't know if I should put my mouth on that.
- **Maxwell**: Call forth the beasts!
- **Wagstaff**: Durable and convenient for carving, similar to the tusks from home.
- **Wigfrid**: Höw I läng för battle.
- **Webber**: If this makes a mating call we're in trouble.
- **Walani**: It's a big animal horn.
- **Warly**: There's still some hairs inside.
- **Woodlegs**: Play th' song o'th'Beefalo.
- **Wilba**: COME'ST FROM BIG MONSTER
- **Wormwood**: Branch?
- **Wheeler**: Meh. I like horn mine better.
- **Winona**: Watch out for the business end!
- **Wortox**: Phew! Not one of mine.
- **Wurt**: Toot toot!
- **Walter**: That'll make a decent bugle.
- **Wanda**: It belonged to a beefalo in the past.

## Usage

The Beefalo Horn can also be used to calm Beefalo who have been angered. However, a Beefalo in heat will continue to attack if too close. Additionally, Beefalo Horns can be played to tend [Farm Plant](/wiki/Farm_Plant)s within a 6.25 [Tile](/wiki/Tile) radius.

## Recipe
- **Beefalo Wool**: 8
- **Beefalo Horn**: 1
- **Tool**: [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine)
- **Result**: [Beefalo Hat](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat)

## Tips
- Use the Beefalo Horn during mating season to make killing [Treeguard](/wiki/Treeguard)s, the [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops), [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen)s, and other [Monsters](/wiki/Monster) easier.
- Beefalo will follow the player through [Worm Hole](/wiki/Worm_Hole)s when the horn is used, making it handy to move herds to new locations where they may be sparse.
- When herding Beefalo into a pen, it is helpful to have them follow at dusk. Even though only 5 of them will follow the player at once, the remaining herd will follow suit as they attempt to keep the group together. As an additional benefit, the entire herd will stay wherever they were put when they go to sleep.
- If penning Beefalo in a walled area, it is best to keep the pen several screen lengths away from a base camp. During mating season, the herd will break down walls to get to any mob that wanders too close. By keeping them a few screens away, they are sort of in a "stasis", and placed walls will not be destroyed as often.
- In single-player Don't Starve, with the absence of the [Beefalo Bell](/wiki/Beefalo_Bell), a Beefalo Horn can be used to lead a domesticated Beefalo into the [Caves](/wiki/Cave). This can be very useful if the player wishes to use a Beefalo's increased speed or its tanking capabilities in order to explore the Caves or [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins). Just make sure that the Beefalo Horn has enough durability to make

# Deerclops Battle Strategy

## The Works

To defeat the pesky **Deerclops**, follow these steps:

1. **Chopping Trees in Autumn**: Gather as many pinecones as possible to appease a **Treeguard**.
2. **Utilize Treeguard**: Once appeased, the Treeguard will act as your first line of defense.
3. **Desert Exploration**: Find a desert area to kill **Hounds** and gather **Tooth Traps** for protection against **Giants**.

## Now what?

With the Deerclops defeated, you have **Living Logs** from the Treeguard and **Meat** from the Giants. If you or your friend is Wilson, shave after winter for **Meat Effigies**. You should be prepared for any monsters.

- **Base Preparation**: Set up two bases, one with a weapon chest and a fire pit, and another for storage.
- **Pig Skin**: Gather **Pig Skin** for various uses, including a **Football Helmet**.

## Tooth traps + road technique

Use this technique to fight giants in DST:

1. **Collect Hound Teeth**: Kill **Hounds** or search **Walrus Camps** for teeth.
2. **Set Tooth Traps**: Place traps along a straight **road**.
3. **Kite the Giant**: Use the road to kite the giant, activating tooth traps for extra damage.
4. **Teamwork**: Work together to reset traps and defeat the giant.

## Gunpowder technique

Kill giants using **Gunpowder**, but be careful not to destroy the loot:

1. **Weaken the Giant**: Use Gunpowder to lower the giant's health.
2. **Finish Off**: Hit the giant a few more times to finish it off.

| Giant | Health | Gunpowder Needed |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Deerclops | 4000 | 19 |
| Goose/Moose | 6000 | 29 |
| Bearger | 6000 | 29 |
| Dragonfly | 27500 | 137 |

Remember to have healing items, additional armors, and helmets for the battle. Hounds may also attack during the fight, so manage them accordingly.

Feel free to edit this guide if anything is missed. Enjoy!

## Trivia
- As of the "She Sells Sea Shells" update for Don't Starve Together, Willow's examination quote for watermelon and grilled watermelon were changed to avoid confusion with the new character. Her quote for watermelon was changed from "I once knew a melon named Walter. He was a jerk." to "But where's the firemelon?", and her quote for grilled watermelon was changed from "Warm, sweet, juicy Walter." to "I made my own firemelon." These quotes were changed to avoid confusion over the new character, Walter, though the old quotes are still present in Singleplayer. Joe W further confirmed that Willow did not

# Forest Biome

![Trees willow](Trees willow.jpg)

"Smells like mud." - Maxwell

## Overview
The Forest biome is characterized by dark green ground and an abundance of Evergreens and Lumpy Evergreens. In addition to trees, Boulders, Graves, and Spider Dens can be found here. Forests are the most prone to Fire and Treeguard spawning due to the high density of trees.

## Location and Variants
Forests can be found as whole islands, in the center of a Marsh, or as small portions of other islands, typically near the center. It is also possible to find other biomes in the center of a forest biome. There are at least 2 forests in each world, with the following variants:

### Moonstone Forest
- Contains the Moon Stone Set Piece
- Guaranteed to have a small, internal grassland with a Walrus Camp

### Mandrake Forest
- Spawns with a small contained grassland with 1-3 Mandrakes
- Contains a mini Savanna with Beefalos

### Spider Forest
- High density of Spider Dens (Level 1 and 2)
- Sporadic Pig Houses close to Spider Dens, leading to fights between Spiders and Pigs
- Contains occasional Graves, making it a natural source of graves outside of Set Pieces
- Common Green Mushrooms

### Lumpy Forest
- Most, if not all trees replaced with Lumpy Evergreens, making them non-renewable
- Occasionally melds with other forest variants

### Totally Normal Forest
- Dotted with Totally Normal Trees surrounded by Evil Flowers
- Can be cut and dug up for Living Logs to craft a Shadow Manipulator
- Occasionally melds with other forest variants

## Flora and Fauna
- Abundant: Lumpy Evergreen, Evergreen, Sapling, Crow, Redbird, Twiggy Tree
- Occasional: Berry Bush, Mushrooms (Blue, Red, Green), Flower, Boulder, Gold Vein, Grave, Pig House, Spider Den, Pond, Fireflies, Mini Glacier, Juicy Berry Bush
- Rare: Totally Normal Tree, Walrus Camp, Sinkhole, Worm Hole, Stagehand, Moon Stone, Moon Rubble, Moonrock Hound, Conspicuous Chest

## Turf
- Forest Turf

## Additional Information
In Don't Starve Together, the Stagehand, Terrarium, and Moon Stone Set Piece spawn in the Forest biome. In some worlds, Juicy Berry Bushes and Twiggy Trees replace Berry Bushes and Saplings, respectively, including in this biome.

# MacTusk n' Son

![MacTusk N' Son, Walrus Hunting Party](MacTuskNSon.jpg){: .center width="350px"}

MacTusk n' Son is a Walrus Hunting Party consisting of MacTusk, Wee MacTusk, and two Blue Hounds. They spawn from Walrus Camps in Winter.

## Command structure

| Walrus Camp | MacTusk | Wee MacTusk | Blue Hound | Blue Hound |
|------------|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| ![Walrus Camp] | ![MacTusk] | ![Wee MacTusk] | ![Blue Hound] | ![Blue Hound] |

## Behavior

They're only active during daytime and, if not engaged, will return to their igloo at dusk. However, they can be forced out by attacking the sleeping Hounds. Although the Walrus Camp emits light at dark, the Hounds will attack anyone close by.

The group, being hostile towards almost any Mob, follows a nearby target; if one keeps walking away, they will not attack. When the leader, MacTusk, becomes hostile, he makes a slashing gesture, he then shoots and pursues the target, while Wee MacTusk commands the Hounds to attack. Both walruses will flee when approached.

Should MacTusk and Wee MacTusk die, the Hounds will attack freely until they respawn. If the Hounds are killed but MacTusk survives, he will come out the next day. Dead members respawn in 2.5 days.

## Tips

- MacTusk can be chased towards his igloo to block his path; he can then be stun-locked and taken out with a melee weapon.
- Dispatching two Blue Hounds in quick succession will freeze the attacker, this can be avoided by waiting out the pale hue before killing the second one.
- MacTusk can be stun-locked while doing the battle cry animation.
- One can use a combo of Ice Staff and a weapon on MacTusk.
- Should one come across a dormant Walrus Camp, it would be prudent to set up defenses, such as Tooth Traps.
- It is possible to construct a MacTusk drop farm using at least 4 Pig Houses. Stone Walls can be used to keep them closer to each other, allowing easy access to the non-food drops. It also makes basing near the Walrus Camp more beneficial.

## Trivia

- MacTusk N' Son was introduced in the A Winter's Tale update.
- MacTusk deals 33 damage with his Blow Dart, whereas the player deals 100 damage with the same weapon. This is because MacTusk uses an identical weapon in the code with 0 damage, which takes his damage output. Without it, he would hurt the player instantly.
- Wolfgang refers to MacTusk as "Sea Cow man!". Sea Cow is a marine mammal unrelated to the Walrus.
- As seen by his quotes, Maxwell knows MacTusk and perhaps created him.
- Both walruses share the same hunchback model as Pigs, Merms, and Bunnymen.
- In the trailer for A Winter's Tale, Wee MacTusk also attacks the player.

## Bugs

- MacTusk will become passive and return to his camp if chased outside of his wandering range, ignoring enemies.
- If the Walrus Camp is close to the shore, MacTusk may respawn and walk on the ocean, unable to get back on land. This bug also occurs to other mobs if their housing structure is too close to the ocean.
- When the season changes, the group may be locked out of their camp, and therefore, be active outside of Winter.

# The Ancients

![A once proud race.](Obelisk face1.PNG)

## Appearance
Arthropodal in biology, slightly humanoid, hunched posture

## Creations
- Thulecite ![Thulecite](Thulecite)
- Ancient Pseudoscience Station ![Ancient Tab](Ancient Pseudoscience Station)

## Downfall
Overuse of Nightmare Fuel, leading to their destruction via the Ancient Gateway

> "I’d never wanna meet one in person." - Winona

The Ancient Civilization were a race of magically and technologically adept beings who destroyed themselves by overuse of Nightmare Fuel (causing the periods of magical flux and possibly unleashing Shadow Creatures, which helped in bringing their downfall). The Ruins and Ancient Archive are the remnants of their civilization.

While little is known about them, examination quotes for Ancient Murals, Ancient Lunarune Stones, and images from the Metheus Puzzles offer hints on their history.

## Archive Civilization
The name "Archive Civilization" comes from the Ancient Archive, which is the period in which it was built - before other Ruins. Other things that may have been built during this period are the Moon Stone and various Ancient Gateways.

The examination quotes from the Ancient Lunarune Stones explain that the Ancient in the period obsessed with the "Moon" of The Constant, whom they referred to as a being called Alter.

## Shadow Civilization
When examining the Ancient Fuelweaver and the Ancient Murals, a number of characters refer to the members of the Ancient Civilization as "bug people." These quotes also reveal how the bug people were at one point weak and starving, living in fear. At some point these people discovered Nightmare Fuel, which overtook their civilization. The bug people then shed their outside exoskeleton "skins" and are reborn as Shadow Creatures. It is at this point that they build a beautiful and prosperous civilization by harnessing the Nightmare Fuel to perform Magic.

## Trivia
- The Ancients seem to have used electrical power in some form, as their Relics can drop Frazzled Wires when destroyed.
- The appearance of the Mage Statue reveals that the ancients may have been arthropodic in structure, with a slightly knobby shell on their backs resembling that of a pill bug.
- The Ancient Civilization race strongly resembles that of a Terrorbeak.
- The Ancient Herald that appears during the Aporkalypse seems to be a member of this race.

# Bandit Stash Map

## Exclusivity
Hamlet

## Item Infobox
- **Dropped By:** [Masked Pig](#)
- **Stack:** Does not stack
- **Spawn Code:** `banditmap`

## Quotes
- **Wilson:** "A map to where that thief hid all his treasure!"
- **Willow:** "Good. Now I can get my stuff back."
- **Wolfgang:** "Is where bad guy hide Wolfgang money."
- **Wendy:** "Abigail is the most valuable buried treasure."
- **WX-78:** "A SEARCH ENGINE FOR CURRENCY"
- **Wickerbottom:** "I do enjoy a good mystery."
- **Woodie:** "So that's where he hid everything."
- **Maxwell:** "Now I can steal from that little criminal."
- **Wagstaff:** "A map to the accumulated plunder of that pig bandit."

- **Woodlegs:** "Arrgh! 'Tis treasure!"
- **Wilba:** "LEAD-ETH TO YON TREASURE!"
- **Wormwood:** "Where's stuff?"
- **Wheeler:** "Time to burgle from the burglar."

The **Bandit Stash Map** is an **Item** exclusive to **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC that is dropped by the **Masked Pig** upon death. If the player reads it, a red **X** appears on their **Map** indicating the location of a **Secret Bandit Camp**.

Upon reaching the Bandit Camp, it must be dug up using a **Shovel**. This will produce a **Peagawk Plume** and a **Chest** which will contain rare/valuable items, such as **Food**, **Gold**, **Armor**, or **Oinc**s.

## Trivia
- The Bandit Stash Map acts similarly to a **Message in a Bottle** from the **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** DLC.
- It is impossible to read a Bandit Stash Map inside a house. If the player tries to do it, the Map will open, but no X mark will be displayed. However, when the player leaves the house, the X will be on the map.
- If the player uses **Console Commands** to spawn a Bandit Stash Map, it will not be readable by the Character, and will vanish from the **Inventory** upon trying.

# What is Wetness?

**Wetness** is the state of being wet in all **DLC**s of **Don't Starve**, and **Don't Starve Together**. Being wet is a mostly negative state to be in, as it makes many items wet and there is a danger of freezing. Standing in **rain**, wearing soaked clothes, standing on **flooded** ground, and colliding with **waves** can all increase wetness. Other things, such as wearing the **Fashion Melon**, the **Ice Cube**, or having **Ice** melting in the **inventory** can also increase Wetness.

# Wetness pertaining to **Items**

Many items can become wet. Wet tools and weapons have a chance to slip out of your grip during use, making them less efficient. Wet **Clothes** rapidly decrease **sanity** while worn. Items that are able to be used as **fuel**, such as **logs** and certain **turfs**, lose much of their fuel value while wet.

# Wetness pertaining to **Food**

When food gets wet, it spoils at a much faster rate than when dry, making almost all food less efficient for travel. Drying **meats** on a **Drying Rack** will not result in **Jerky** until it dries off. To keep food dry, store it in a **Chest**, **Ice Box**, **Piggyback**, or **Krampus Sack** until needed.

# Wetness Prevention

There are many ways to prevent wetness. The cheapest option available is to wear a **Straw Hat**, hold a **Pretty Parasol**, and stand under a **tree** for 100% wetness resistance. Other craftable items, such as the **Snakeskin Hat**, **Umbrella**, **Eyebrella** or **Rain Coat**, can also provide wetness resistance.

This chart has all the values of water resistance on it for every clothing item. Every clothing item has a base of 20%.

## Water Resistant Items

| Item               | Water Resistance | Slot  |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Battle Helm        | 20%            | Head  |

| Shelmet            | 20%            | Head  |

| Pretty Parasol     | 50%            | Hand  |
| Tropical Parasol   | 50%            | Hand  |
| Rain Hat           | 70%            | Head  |
| Snakeskin Hat      | 70%            | Head  |
| Snakeskin Jacket   | 70%            | Chest |
| Umbrella           | 90%            | Hand  |
| Blubber Suit       | 100%           | Chest |
| Dumbrella         | 100%           | Head  |
| Eyebrella         | 100%           | Head  |
| Rain Coat          | 100%           | Chest |

# The Two Benefits of Wetness

There may not seem to be any benefits of Wetness. A minor advantage can apply to **WX-78**, since as they get wet, they emit sparkles just bright enough to keep **Charlie** away, minus the loss of health.

Another benefit is the decrease of temperature. While this benefit is a double edged sword, as it can cause **freezing**, the decrease in temperature can be a life-saver during **Summer** in ROG and DST and the **Dry Season** in SW.

Pillars are **Structures** found in **Caves** and **Ruins**. They cannot be interacted with or removed without the use of **Console Commands**. They can obstruct the player's view and movement, and only serve a decorative role.

Pillars, Cave Rock, and Flintless, match other resources in the biomes they are found in. While visually distinct, they are functionally identical to the original Cave Pillar.

In the **A New Reign** expansion, a new variant of Pillars can be found in the **Atrium** Biome. Similar to the Ruins version, they will change colors when the **Ancient Gateway** is activated.

In the **Return of Them** expansion, the **Return of Them#Forgotten Knowledge|Forgotten Knowledge** update introduced **Archive Pillars** in the **Ancient Archive** biome. They come in normal and broken versions.

# Chess Figures

Chess Figures are **Trinkets** that can be obtained from digging up **Graves**, picking **Tumbleweeds**, and hammering **Ancient Pseudoscience Stations** after the **Sketch** of its figure is unlocked in the world. Giving one of these trinkets to the **Pig King** will yield four **Gold Nuggets** and a **Sketch** for the respective **Chess Piece Figure**. When given to the **Antlion** as tribute, these trinkets delay its rage by 0.66 days.

A **Tumbleweed** is a form of flora found in the Reign of Giants DLC. They spawn from an invisible spawner in the Desert biome and can be found tumbling around, often in groups; they may also tumble from a Desert into nearby biomes. Catcooons can also spit up Tumbleweeds. When the player is near a Tumbleweed, it will make a musical sound.

The player can harvest a Tumbleweed to get 3 random items generated on the ground. If the generated item is a non-passive Mob, it will attack the player character. Each item is generated independently, therefore it is possible to get more than one of an item from a single Tumbleweed. Possible items include Gems and other previously non-renewable items, making them renewable. Food items gathered from Tumbleweed have full freshness.

Tumbleweeds also provide a backup source of Chess Piece Sketches - either directly in the form of sketches themselves, or indirectly in the form of Chess Trinkets. These will drop only if each piece was unlocked in the world. Rook, Knight and Bishop trinkets are unlocked by reanimating each of the repaired Marble Sculptures during a Full Moon or New Moon. The Pawn and Queenly sketches are unlocked by mining their respective Marble Statues, while the Kingly sketch is unlocked by mining the Maxwell Statue.

Additionally, Saffron Feathers can drop from Tumbleweeds, chance of Seeds drop was reduced and Blueprint recipes restricted. In general, Tumbleweeds can only spawn recipes that can be prototyped at an Alchemy Engine or Shadow Manipulator, including the low-tier recipes unlocked by Science Machine and Prestihatitator. However, blueprints for turfs such as forrest or savanna turf are also rarely generated.

## Fresh Fruit Crepes Description
'''Fresh Fruit Crepes''' is a [[Warly]]-specific [[Food]] [[Item]] cooked in the [[Portable Crock Pot]] by adding 1.5 units of [[Fruits]], 1 [[Butter]], and 1 [[Honey]]. It takes 40 seconds to cook and restores 150 {{Hunger}}, 60 {{Hp}}, and 15 {{Sanity}} when eaten.

Note that [[Durian]] and [[Dragon Fruit]] can be freely used when making, as this recipe has higher priority than [[Monster Lasagna]] and [[Dragonpie]] (However, adding 2 Durians may result in [[Monster Tartare]] instead). Adding 2 [[Berries]] will result in [[Fist Full of Jam]] instead, due to insufficient Fruit units requirement.

Fresh Fruit Crepes are also included in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' as a dish exclusive to the Portable Crock Pot. It is also the favorite food of [[Wes]], able to restore 165 hunger. However, as even the default hunger value already exceeds Wes's [[Hunger]] capacity, this benefit is useless.

## Recipe
### Cookbook Recipe
- Item 1: Fruit (1.5)
- Item 2: Butter (1)
- Item 3: Honey (1)

   - Item 3: Honey

## Trivia
- Fresh Fruit Crepes were added to ''Don't Starve Together'' in the [[Don't Starve Together/Version History#July 25, 2019 - Warly Character Update|Warly Character Update]].
- In [C'est La Vie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao61s4M7rtA), Wes' animated short, Wes can be seen buying fruit crepes from a nearby store, hence why it is his favorite food.
