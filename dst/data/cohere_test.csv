## Origin

Maxwell's backstory is given in the Compendium. Formerly the king of the Nightmare Throne, he was once William Carter, a penniless man from London who dreamt of being a world-renowned magician. After gaining possession of the Codex Umbra, he embraced his new persona as a charismatic master of dark magic. His quest for more power led to his downfall, and he was trapped in the Constant, compelled to ensnare more victims.

## Unlocking

Maxwell can be unlocked by completing Adventure Mode and choosing to release him from the Nightmare Throne using a Divining Rod.

## Lore

- Maxwell's examination quote for Tallbirds reveals that he created them by accident through a failed experiment.
- Maxwell has a brother named Jack Carter, as revealed in the William Carter Puzzles.

- His name may be a reference to Charles Carter, a stage magician from the early 20th century.
- His Dark Wizard skin may be based on Grigiveche Efimovich Rasputin, who, according to some legends, owned dark magic.

### {{Quote|Hmmm. I wonder if these will burn.|Willow}}

**Willow** is the Second playable **Character** in *Don't Starve* that can be unlocked via **Experience**, when the player reaches 160 XP. She is also one of the playable Characters in *Don't Starve Together* (DST). She is a young woman who is obsessed with fire.

As part of the *Don't Starve Together* content updates, Willow received a character refresh on May 7, 2019.[^1]

Willow's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled *From the Ashes*. An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [[Compendium]]:

*Willow always regarded being brought to [[The Constant]] as a new beginning. It allowed her to leave everything behind, after all. From a young age, Willow seemed to possess a knack for attracting bad luck. Orphaned at a young age and forced to live in a children's home with cruel caregivers, she soon found her nights plagued by shadowy visions of terrible creatures... creatures that could only be held at bay by her faithful teddy bear Bernie. But when Bernie was taken away as punishment for what her caregivers saw as unfit behavior, Willow was left to fend for herself when the shadows came for her. That's when she learned that nothing holds back the darkness like a roaring flame. Nothing is more comforting than watching your troubles light up and crumble to ash...  It wouldn't be the last time Willow burned it all down to start anew.*

## {{pic|32|Placeholder}} Trivia

### In-Game
* Willow was added to the original Don't Starve Chrome build on August 7, 2012.[^2]
* Willow's voice is played by a flute.
* Willow has a [[Unimplemented Items#Player Skulls|skull]] in the game files.
* Willow's previous perk, before the [[Version History#July 2, 2013 - Strange New Powers|Strange New Powers]] update, was to light fires at her feet when in darkness, like she does when low on Sanity now.
* When struck by [[Lightning]] in DLCs, Willow, like most other Characters, is shown to have bones in her hair. In addition to this, she has bones in her skirt.
* Willow was the second Don't Star","Willow, Firestarter, obsessed with fire, from Don't Starve."

# Krampus

## Behavior

Krampus is a neutral monster that steals the player's stored items and items left on the ground. It appears when players gain too much Naughtiness from killing innocent creatures too fast.

### Quotes

- Wilson: He's going after my stuff!
- Willow: Stay back, you big jerk!
- Wolfgang: Scary goat man! Run!
- Wendy: Hello, foul creature of the underworld.
- WX78: STOP! THIEF!
- Wickerbottom: It's a mythological holiday monster.
- Woodie: Back off, hoser!
- Maxwell: You'll never catch me!
- Wagstaff: He appears to be drawn to my moral ambiguity.
- Wigfrid: Yöu dön't scare me, göat!
- Webber: Give us back our things!
- Walani: Stealing isn't cool!
- Warly: What the devil!
- Woodlegs: What did ol'Woodlegs do?
- Wilba: 'TIS BIG MEANY
- Wormwood: Mean Branch Head
- Wheeler: Whoops. All those little bad acts have come back to haunt me.
- Winona: Some sort of... festive devil?
- Wortox: Heh heh. No hard feelings?
- Wurt: Big meanie!!
- Walter: Hey! Did you rifle through my supplies?
- Wanda: He really puts a damper on this time of year.

## Naughtiness

Naughtiness is generated by killing certain creatures. Once the player reaches a threshold of naughtiness, Krampus will spawn. After Krampus appears, the naughtiness level is reset to 0.

## Strategy

Krampus, especially when more than one spawns at the same time, can wreak havoc in a player's base without adequate preparation. Players are advised to pay attention to the signs of naughtiness, and only summon Krampus when preparations are complete; away from important items and the player's base.

## Downloadable Content

- In the Reign of Giants DLC, killing Glommer will immediately summon Krampii as it increases naughtiness by 50 points, the exact amount needed to spawn Krampus.
- In the Shipwrecked DLC, Krampus will be wearing a Floral Shirt on his visit to the islands.
- In the Hamlet DLC, Krampus has the ability to enter interiors.

## Tips

- Summoning Krampus at night will summon sleeping Krampii, including during a Full Moon, which allows them to be easily killed.
- Tooth Traps are not very effective against Krampus since there is a chance that he will steal the trap instead of activating it.
- Various forms of ""Krampus traps"" can be created utilizing their behavior of stealing items.

## Trivia

- Krampus was added in the Naughty and Nice update.
- Krampus is a beast-like creature from the folklore of Alpine countries, thought to punish bad children during the Yule season by whipping them into submission.

"# WX-78

## Origin

WX-78's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled [[Animated Shorts and Trailers#Disconnected|Disconnected]].

An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [[Compendium]]:

''WX-78 was the result of an unorthodox experiment helmed by {[LoadEmpathyModLibraryExW()......ERROR_DATA_PATH_NOT_FOUND]} and Robert Wagstaff. The experiment turned out to be a [RESOUNDING SUCCESS], but Wagstaff was [A SHORT SIGHTED FOOL, AFRAID OF PROGRESS] and decided to put a stop to further tests. Adamant that the process that created them could still be perfected, WX refused to give up, continuing their experiments in secret. When Wagstaff discovered what they had been doing, there was a heated argument and01110100 01101111 01101111 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101 00100000 01110100 01101111 01101111 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101 00100000 01110100 01101111 01101111 00100000 01101100 01100001 01110100 01100101''

## Tips

- WX-78 acts like a [[Lightning Rod]]. If any event launches multiple lightning strikes, such as reading [[The End is Nigh]], '''all''' strikes will usually target WX-78.
- Equipping an [[Umbrella]] alongside a hat that offers at least 10% rain protection (such as the [[Straw Hat]]) will completely shield WX-78 from Rain, preventing any damage from being taken.
- WX-78 players may want to avoid using items that offer Lightning immunity (such as the Umbrella or [[Eyebrella]]) if they require healing, though they will take a hit to their Sanity with each strike.
- Using the [[Ice Cube]] or [[Fashion Melon]] as protection from [[Overheating]] is not advised, as the Wetness gained from those items will damage WX-78.
- WX-78's gear consumption ability & light-providing circuits makes them one of the better equipped characters for traversing the [[Ruins]].
- Since they ignore spoilage and food loses all sanity restoration as soon as it turns stale, WX-78 players have at least double the time to utilize foods that grant high sanity but spoil quickly, giving them a distinct advantage over other characters in terms of sanity management.
- In DST, WX-78's [[Don't Starve Together#Favorite Food|favorite food]] is [[Butter Muffin]], meaning that they gain 15 bonus {{Hunger}} when consuming the food.

## Trivia

### In-Game

- WX-78 was added to ''Don't Starve'' in the ''[[Don't Starve/Version_History#January 15, 2013 – Spoiled Rotten|Spoiled Rotten]]'' update on January 15, 2013.
- WX-78's voice is played by what is explained as a ""crazy processed synth"".
- WX-78 has a [[Unimplemented Features#Player Skulls|Skull]] in the game files. Also, when struck by Lightning, a skeleton can be seen.
- WX-78 makes a unique creaking noise as they walk.
- Although they take damage from Wetness, WX-78 can eat watery foods such as [[Pomegranate]]s, [[Meaty Stew]], or even [[Watermelon]]s without being harmed.
- WX-78 is one of the original four Characters that were available during the closed Beta of DST.
- In DST, if the player communicates to others with the Y or U keys as WX-78, all messages will be sent in uppercase letters like their original dialogue.
- Most of their audio files are labelled Woodrow, which may indicate they were originally meant for an [[Unimplemented Characters|unimplemented character]] who also has their own audio files in the code. That, or Woodrow was an early iteration of their character.
- WX-78 is oddly inconsistent with their punctuation in quotes. For instance, they often leave the end of their sentences without a period.
- When WX-78 examines a [[Slurper]], they will say ""IT VIOLATED MY SMELLING MODULE"", but when they examine a [[Durian]], they will say ""GOOD THING I LACK A NOSE"". This inconsistency may be intentional for comedic effect or just an error.
- WX-78 was originally planned to speak in randomly generated binary.<ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/6745-wx78-the-autom","WX-78, Lightning Rod, Rain protection, Ruins traversal, Sanity management."

The Rain Hat is a craftable Dress item from the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC. It requires 2 Moleworms, 1 Straw Hat, and 1 Bone Shard to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The Sewing Kit repairs 50% of its durability.

When worn during Rain, it protects against Wetness gain by 70%. Additionally, it insulates the player against Lightning strikes and the electric shocks of a charged Volt Goat.

## Trivia
- Rain Hats require Moleworms to craft because the moleskin is known for its water-resistance.
- The crafting recipe used to require Tentacle Spots instead of Moleworms.
- Wearing this hat while standing under a Tree provides sufficient Wetness protection from rain.

# Wigfrid
Wigfrid is one of the two playable **Characters** exclusive to the **Reign of Giants** DLC. She is the seventh Character to be unlocked via **Experience**, with 1920 XP. She is also one of the playable Characters in **Don't Starve Together** (DST). Although Wigfrid has the appearance of a **Valkyrie**, she's just a stage actress.

## Origin
Wigfrid's backstory was revealed in the animated short **The Curtain Calls**. The short is officially summarized in DST's **Compendium**:
""Wigfrid always knew she was meant for the stage. Her debut performance was an instant sensation, launching her from obscurity to overnight stardom. Fans delighted in her portrayal of a noble and fearsome Valkyrie warrior, and she in turn took great pains to fully embody the role. She was perfect for it... perhaps too perfect. Every part she played afterward seemed to fall flat, never again achieving that magical quality that had once drawn audiences to her performances like bees to honey. As Wigfrid’s stardom slowly began to fade, she retreated to the memories of her glory days, losing herself in her fantasies...''

""Until one day, she was lost entirely.""

## Trivia
### In-Game
- Wigfrid was added to **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** in the **A Feet of Strength** update on March 12, 2014.
- In **Don't Starve**, anytime Wigfrid uses the letter ""O"", she says it with umlauts (""Ö""), even if there are two in a row. In DST, only the first of consecutive ""O""s will have an umlaut. Umlauts can be toggled in the settings, using the ""Umlautify"" option.
- Wigfrid is voiced by very processed brass horns.
- Despite Butterfly Wings/butter muffins being made from an animal, she cannot eat them.
- Wigfrid’s birthday is listed as March 23rd in the **Compendium**.
- While being described as excellent in combat, Wigfrid's bonuses are outclassed by those of other characters; most also have higher Hunger and Sanity while lacking her inability to eat non-meat foods. On the other hand, Wigfrid is the only character to have combat bonuses in so many fields (attack power, damage resistance, starting equipment, and health/Sanity regeneration), and she also lacks the other characters' weaknesses; overall, she is a ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" type of character when it comes to fighting.

### Lore
- Wigfrid dislikes **Mushrooms**, according to her **examination quotes**.
- Wigfrid is able to break character, as shown by her quotes when entering/leaving light (""And the curtain falls.""; ""I step intö the light!"") and when examining a **Top Hat** (""It döesn't match my cöstume."") or a **Pirate Hat** (""This hat cönfuses my character... I mean, my söul."").
- Wigfrid's DST **loading screen vignette** is accompanied by text that reveals a bit about her acting skills: ""The valor and confidence of a Valkyrie didn't always come naturally to Wigfrid. She cultivated her strength and persona over many years through sheer force of will.""

### Cultural References
- Wigfrid is referred to as **Wathgrithr** in the game files, which comes from the name of a Valkyrie, Ráðgríðr (Rathgrithr).
- Wigfrid's role as an actress may be a reference to the famous opera cycle by Richard Wagner called **The Ring of The Nibelung**. Her name may be a reference to the same opera cycle's main character Siegfried, but the character is possibly based on the main female character, a valkyrie named Brynhilde.
- Her motto for DST is a reference to a **Shakespeare quote**.
- Toni from **Rhymes with Play** #201 said that Wigfrid's Victorian skin is based on an illustration by Alphonse Mucha, which depicts Sarah Bernhardt as Prince Hamlet from the **titular Shakespeare play**.
- Wigfrid's Contender skin set is called ""The Ultimate Performer"", which may be a reference to **The Ultimate Warrior**, a professional wrestler. Her mask even calls to mind The Ultimate Warrior's famous face paint.
- Her The Snowfallen skin possibly refers to frost giant or **Jötunn** from norse mythology.
- Wigfrid Magmatic quote ref to **Surtr** from Norse mythology.
- Wigfrid Magmatic description ref to **Ragnarök","Characters, Valkyrie, Experience, Reign of Giants DLC, Don't Starve Together, The Curtain Calls, Compendium, actress, Shakespeare, Richard Wagner, Ultimate Warrior, Jötunn, Surtr, Ragnarök"

# Deconstruction Staff

## Overview

The Deconstruction Staff is a craftable item found in the Ancient Tab. It requires at least a Broken Pseudoscience Station to craft, and costs 4 Nightmare Fuel, 2 Living Logs, and 2 Green Gems to craft. It can also randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when the latter is damaged with a Hammer, Gunpowder, etc. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Deconstruction Staves cannot be prototyped and can only be crafted within range of an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

## Usage

When used on a craftable Structure, the Deconstruction Staff returns 100% of the ingredients needed to craft it. However, when used on an Item, the Staff will return a percentage of the materials equal to the remaining durability, rounded up. If Gems were used in the crafting process, they will not be returned and will always ""shatter"" instead. With each use of the Staff, Characters will lose 20 sanity and the Staff will lose 20% of its Durability.

### Content Downloadable

In the Reign of Giants DLC, players have a small (0.02%) chance of finding Green Gems inside Tumbleweeds, thus making Deconstruction Staves renewable.

In the Hamlet DLC, the Deconstruction Staff is one of the two items that can permanently destroy Town Houses, Pig Shops, Watch Towers, Lawn Decorations, Intricate Topiaries, and Hedges that cannot be destroyed with a Hammer. The other is the Executive Hammer.

| Thulecite Wall | Thulecite×0.167 | Thulecite×1 | Green Gem×0.24 Living Log×0.2 Nightmare Fuel×0.52 | Thulecite×0.753 |

## Tips

- Since Green Gems are so rare, the best use for Deconstruction Staffs is on Items or Structures that require very rare or non-renewable materials (e.g. items from the Ancient or Magic Tab).
- Some items that are created using a single non-renewable ingredient (e.g. Pan Flute) can be deconstructed and crafted again to extend their usage, since the Staff will always return at least one of the non-gem materials used.
- The Deconstruction","craftable item, returns ingredients, destroys structures, renewable."

# Crafting

Crafting is an in-game mechanic that allows players to craft or make **Items** and **Structures**. This is done by selecting an item or structure to be crafted in one of the 19 **Crafting Tabs** (including **DLC**s, and **Character-Specific** tabs). Provided the player has sufficient materials in their inventory and, if necessary, has **unlocked** the item recipe, they will receive 1 or more of the crafted item. Below are the crafting tables for the different game modes available. The availability of crafting recipes are further affected by game version, the player's world (Game Mode), special **Events**, etc.

## Unlocked

Unlocking for the first time will grant the player 15 **Sanity**. Once unlocked, items can be crafted any time.

### Prototype

Generally, each Item or Structure must be **""prototyped""** at a particular **Prototyper** or through other means to be unlocked. Once the item has been unlocked, it can be crafted anywhere, anytime (so long as the required materials are available). Tier 1 items can be unlocked at either a **Science Machine** or **Alchemy Engine**. Tier 2 items can only be unlocked at an Alchemy Engine, ETC.

*Some recipes require the player in a specified world to be available. (Removed in Hamlet version)
**Some recipes require the player to be in a specified world to Prototypeable. (Add in Hamlet version)

Standing near the Prototyper allows prototyping new recipes. The following is a list of all the Prototypers:

| ![Science Machine](Science Machine.png) | [Science Machine](Science Machine) Tier 1 |
| ![Alchemy Engine](Alchemy Engine.png) | [Alchemy Engine] Tier 2 |
| ![Prestihatitator](Prestihatitator.png) | [Prestihatitator] Tier 1 |
| ![Shadow Manipulator](Shadow Manipulator.png) | [Shadow Manipulator] Tier 2 |
| ![Sea Lab](Sea Lab.png) | [Sea Lab] Tier 2 |
| ![Piratihatitator](Piratihatitator.png) | [Piratihatitator] Tier 1 |
| ![Hogus Porkusator](Hogus Porkusator.png) | [Hogus Porkusator] Tier 1 |

## Blueprint

## Webber's Switcherdoodle

## Crafting Station

Crafting Station is similar to Prototyper, except that they do not unlock the recipe for the player after they make it, so the player must return to Crafting Station if they want to make the item again. In the **Hamlet** DLC, the interior areas of **Slanty Shanty** can be considered to be a hidden Crafting Station. The Key to the City can be carried in the inventory, making it movable unlike other Crafting Stations.

The following is a list of all the Crafting Station:

| ![Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station](Broken Pseudoscience Station Build.png) | [Broken Ancient Pseudoscience Station] |
| ![Ancient Pseudoscience Station](Ancient Pseudoscience Station.png) | [Ancient Pseudoscience Station] |
| ![Obsidian Workbench](Obsidian Workbench Build.png) | [Obsidian Workbench] |
| ![Key to the City](Key_to_the_City.png) | [Key to the City] |

## Crafting Tab in Don't Starve

There are 19 **Crafting Tabs** in **Don't Starve** and its **DLC**s for different **Items** and **Structures** that can be crafted.

## Webber

'''Webber''' is one of the two playable [[Characters]] exclusive to the {{Giants|l}} DLC. He's the only one of the two that is not unlocked via [[Experience]]. He's also one of the playable Characters in [[Don't Starve Together|''Don't Starve Together'']]. Webber looks like a humanoid spider, though he's actually a child that was fused with a spider that tried to eat him. He received a character refresh exclusive to DST in June 2021.<ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/129647-dont-starve-together-return-of-them-eye-of-the-storm-now-available/] Posted on May 5, 2021.</ref>

Webber's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled ''[[Animated Shorts and Trailers#Along Came A Spider|Along Came A Spider]]''. An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [[Compendium]]:

''Once upon a time, there was a young boy who lived with his family on a small farmstead. Though they lived humbly, the boy's home was filled with love, and he grew up happy and kind. The boy might have lived contentedly for the rest of his days if not for the sudden arrival of an old aquaintance[sic], who came to the house beseeching the boy's father for his expertise on a strange and secretive project...''

## {{See also|Food}}
To see what type of the Food is, please refer to: [Food Type](#).

These ""food values"" measure how plentifully an ingredient can fulfill a recipe's need for certain food groups, plays in and **only** in [Crock Pot](#). Combined ingredients' food values (in addition to [#Priority|recipe priority]) are what determine an attempt's final dish; for example: [Honey Ham](#) requires a meat value greater than or equal to 2.0, so in addition to [Honey](#), its ingredients can be 3 Jerky; 2 Jerky & 1 filler; or 1 Jerky & 2 [Drumstick](#)s, but 1 Jerky, 1 Drumstick, & 1 filler won't cut it.

The overall set of food values for an attempted dish is the sum of its individual ingredient values. In attempting a dish like ![Monster Meat](#) ![Meat](#) ![Meat](#) ![Meat](#) ![Berries](#), the component values are:
- +1 meat, +1 monster
- +1 meat
- +1 meat
- +0.5 fruit

When added up, the final dish's set of values will be 3.0 meat, 1.0 monster, and 0.5 fruit. resulting in [Meaty Stew](#).

Some ingredients value for two food groups; for example: raw [Tropical Fish](#) provides 1.0 fish unit & 0.5 meat units (though [Cooked Fish Morsel](#) provides 0.5 fish units & no meat units).

## Meat value

There are 13 basic **Meat** [food](#) [items](#) in-game. There is one additional Meat in the **[Reign of Giants]** DLC, 11 additional Meats in the **[Shipwrecked]** DLC, two additional Meats in the **[Hamlet]** DLC, and eight additional Meats in **[Don't Starve Together]**. Most meats are dropped by [Mobs](#) as loot, and [fish](#) can also be obtained from [Pond](#)s with a [Fishing Rod](#). If a mob dies from burning, the cooked variant of meat will be dropped instead (if available). Many of the meats can be dried on a [Drying Rack](#), resulting in [Jerky](#), a much longer-lasting food item with different [Hunger](#), [Sanity](#), and [Health](#) bonuses.

Mobs such as [Pigs](#), [Spider](#)s or [Hound](#)s will eat any form of dropped meat on the ground, including [Pig Skin](#)s. Additionally, [Bunnymen](#) will be aggressive towards the player if they have any item on this list.

There are 10 [Crock Pot](#) recipes that require Meat. There are two additional recipes in the **Reign of Giants** DLC, four additional recipes in the **Shipwrecked** DLC, three additional recipes in the **Hamlet** DLC, and one additional recipe in **Don't Starve Together**. [Warly|Warly's](#) [Portable Crock Pot](#) also has a recipe that requires meat in **Don't Starve Together**. An [Egg](#) is counted as an egg in a Crock Pot, and as meat elsewhere. [Fishes](#) are counted as both fish and meat in a Crock Pot, and as meat elsewhere.

Different [Meats|Meat ingredients](#) have different meat values.

### Foods with meat value of 0.5

## Scrapbook Info
Used to mark a spot, and then used again to teleport to that spot. 8 minute cooldown. Even works between the Cave and the Forest.

The Backtrek Watch gives Wanda the ability to set a waypoint in space, and teleport to that spot at any time. The Watch has an 8 minute (1 day) cooldown, and is able to transport the player between shards (meaning between Surface and Cave in normal game). After the watch has been activated, the examination changes to ""Is it time for us to take a dip in the timestream?"" letting the player know whether or not a destination has already been set. Should the destination be set within a different shard (usually the Caves if you are within the Surface shard and vice versa), her examination will change to ""It'll be a big jump, but I can make it!"". It requires 2 Time Pieces, 2 Gold Nuggets and a Walrus Tusk to craft.

The Football Helmet is a wearable Armor, crafted in the Fight tab. It requires 1 Pig Skin and 1 Rope to craft, and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

It has a Durability of 450 and absorbs 80% of all physical damage. Not factoring the armor's durability, the Football Helmet effectively increases a player's hp to 750 for the average 150 hp survivor.

The Football Helmet can be given to a Pig or Bunnyman to wear to increase their HP by 450.

The Football Helmet may also be found in an Ornate Chest, which spawns in the Ruins.

In the Reign of Giants, Shipwrecked and Hamlet DLCs, the Football Helmet provides 20% Wetness resistance.

In the Hamlet DLC, the Football Helmet is used to craft the Mant Mask.

## Usage

Recipe:
- item2: Chitin
- count2: 5
- item1: Football Helmet
- count1: 1
- result: Mant Mask
- tool: Science Machine
- dlc: Hamlet

## Tips

The Football Helmet is valuable, as it keeps the player protected without losing the Body slot for items such as a Backpack or an Insulated Pack so the player can be more efficient in collecting resources while staying safe. It is recommended to keep at least 1 Football Helmet with you just in case of a potential ambush.

## Trivia

- The Football Helmet was added in the The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You update.
- In American football, the football was once made out of animal leather and called a ""pigskin"".

{{See also|Enlightenment}}

{{Quote|I get crazy when I don't sleep.|Wilson}}
'''Sanity''' is the [[Characters|Character]]'s ""mental health"" in ''[[Don't Starve]]''. The {{sanity}} Sanity icon, represented as a picture of a brain, is located near the character's {{hp}} Health and {{hunger}} Hunger. Characters can gain and lose sanity in various ways. A small animated arrow appears over the {{sanity}} icon, indicating an increase or decrease in Sanity. The size of the arrow signifies the rate of gain or loss.

As sanity decreases, the player's vision becomes shaky, over-saturated, and bright, whispers are heard, and [[Shadow Creature]]s start to appear. These creatures become ""physical"" and aggressive and will attack the player when their sanity is below 15%. When sanity is low, the player's character covers their ears and closes their eyes while rocking back and forth, as if experiencing a bad headache.

Being alone in the wilderness will take its toll. Generally speaking, being in close proximity to [[Monsters]], [[Darkness]], [[Rain]], eating bad or raw [[Food]], or using various magic items decreases sanity; while wearing certain [[Dress|clothing]], eating [[Jerky]] and [[Crock Pot]] food, being near friendly [[Pigs]], and [[sleeping]] increases sanity. See the Sanity Tables below for a complete list.

![Opened console in the game](Console.jpg)

## Console
Console is a developer interface in **Don't Starve** and **Don't Starve Together**. Players can open a console menu by pressing **~** (English/French), **^** or **ö** (German Keyboard Layout) **æ** or **ø** (Scandinavian Keyboard) or **ù** (Azerty Keyboard Layout) and ""Ñ"" in the Spanish Keyboard. It can be hidden again by pressing **Ctrl + L**. However, the feature must be enabled in the settings file located at the following location:

- **Windows, Mac:** `<Documents>\Klei\DoNotstarve\settings.ini`
- **Linux:** `~/.klei/DoNotStarve/settings.ini`

Opening settings.ini, players should make the following changes:

```ini
[MISC]
ENABLECONSOLE = true
```

If a player wishes to disable the console once it has been enabled, they will have to navigate to `\dont_starve\data\scripts\main.lua` and set the ""CONSOLE_ENABLED"" line to false.

- Walter: It still doesn't beat roasting things over a campfire.
- Wanda: I don't like to fuss around with fancy cooking.
- Choose: Warly

The Portable Crock Pot is a character-specific Item that Warly begins the game with. It acts as a Crock Pot that can be moved and replaced. It must be placed on the ground to cook anything.

While cooking, the Portable Crock Pot gives just enough light to ward off Charlie, but the sanity drain is equivalent of staying in total darkness, therefore, this is not recommended. It can also make exclusive recipes.

## Recipes

## Trivia

- The Portable Crockpot was exclusive to the Shipwrecked DLC, until it was introduced to Don't Starve Together in the Warly Character Update.

## Bugs

- In Don't Starve: Shipwrecked, if the player places a Portable Crock Pot inside a Cargo Boat or Chester, exits the game and then relogs, a second Portable Crock Pot will appear in the player's inventory as the game considers the original one to be missing.
- The same bug will occur when the player enters a Cave without the Portable Crock Pot in the inventory. Relogging is not necessary for this to occur.

## Quotes

""Mmm...Smells good!"" - Wormwood

## Overview

Wormwood is one of three Characters introduced in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC. He appears to be an animate plant, akin to Treeguards, though he has a green cut stone on the front of his chest. Wormwood is friendly while a little eccentric, addressing things such as insects as ""Bzzters"" and birds as ""Tweeters.""

On June 6, 2019, Wormwood was added to Don't Starve Together as the second DLC character after Wortox. He is available to Hamlet owners on Steam for free. For all other players, Wormwood can be purchased either through the Wormwood Chest, which includes his Roseate skin set, or through the Wormwood Deluxe Chest, which includes the Roseate, Oasis Bound and Hollow skin sets. He can alternatively be woven with 2,700 Spools.

Wormwood has many unique abilities pertaining to Plants and plant-like Mobs, and he has access to unique crafting recipes that can help with healing and defense. He is able to plant Seeds without the use of a Farm, and he is treated neutrally by Mobs such as the Lureplant and Snaptooth Flytrap. He also seems to have some sort of kinship with plants, addressing most of them as ""Friend,"" or things similar. Because of this, he loses Sanity when plants around him die, and he gains Sanity when he himself plants them.

Wormwood loses Sanity when plants within a five-tile radius are destroyed, even if the damage is not caused by him. Sanity effects from planting or destroying plants is reduced the further it happens from Wormwood.

## Origin

Wormwood's creation is shown in the animated short Lunar Roots. A green gem fell from the moon, landing on an ancient stone monument in the middle of overgrown rubble. Over a long period of time, a vine encircled the gem and eventually formed a humanoid figure sitting on the monument. The figure, Wormwood, opened his eyes and looked at his hands. He admired the tropical scenery, mimicking the flapping wings of the Butterflies with his leaf fingers. Trying to fit in, he imitated Parrots and Pogs, but he scared them off. Feeling downtrodden, he sat at the base of the monument and tucked himself under a nearby vine. He gave it a pat and smiled to himself. He went to sleep and bloomed along with the nearby plants while under the full moon.

## Trivia

- Wormwood was introduced in the February 7, 2019 Character update during the Hamlet DLC's Early Access phase.
- Wormwood's voice is a didgeridoo.
- Wormwood's quotes use the font Henny Penny and are green in color. He is the only character to have a unique font and text color.
- In Don't Starve Together the green color was replaced with white because text color is used in that game's chat system to differentiate","Wormwood, Hamlet DLC, plant abilities, sanity loss, unique crafting recipes."

# Ice Cube

The Ice Cube is a craftable Dress Item from the Reign of Giants DLC. It requires 2 Electrical Doodads, 4 Rope, and 10 Ice to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype.

## Description
Science, on the rocks.

## Perks
- Prevents overheating in Summer or Dry Season.
- Increases wetness over time.
- Walking speed reduced by 10%.

## Crafting Recipe
- Ingredient 1: Electrical Doodad (x2)
- Ingredient 2: Rope (x4)
- Ingredient 3: Ice (x10)

## Tips
- Placing an Ice Cube in the Ice Box will completely stop it from melting.
- The Ice Cube is good addition to the Thermal Stone near the Endothermic Fire Pit and/or in the Ice Box for long trips during Summer.
- The Ice Cube will make inventory and equipped items Wet, causing Sanity loss. This can be used to become insane for farming Nightmare Fuel.
- Even with maximum wetness, Maxwell will not lose any sanity, making this hat rather valuable for him during summer. That being said, the faster food spoilage and slippery weapons are still large downsides to using the Ice Cube for extended periods of time.
- Dress Items with Wetness resistance, such as the Rain Coat, do not reduce wetness from the Ice Cube.
- While wearing the Ice Cube, being near a fire will slowly get rid of player wetness and will prevent the player and the player's items from becoming wet.
- It costs less Ice overall to just build a new Ice Cube than refueling an existing one with Ice, since the latter gives 0.8 days of durability per Ice instead of 0.4.
- Storing important items in the Piggyback will prevent them from becoming wet.
- Wurt does not lose sanity from the Ice Cube's Wetness.

## Trivia
- The description ""Science, on the rocks."" refers to the bartending terminology ""On the rocks"" for a drink served over ice cubes.

The **Ancient Tab** allows players to craft objects using the **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**, whether broken or repaired. Items under this tab cannot be ""prototyped"" and then made on the go in the future; to craft an item under this tab, the player must be near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station, regardless of how many times the item has been crafted. This tab can also be accessed with the **Brain of Thought**.

'''Woodie''' is the sixth playable [[Character]] unlocked via [[Experience]] in ''[[Don't Starve]]'', with 1600 XP. He is also one of the playable [[Character]]s in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' (DST). He is a stereotypical Canadian lumberjack with a love for chopping [[Trees]] and a mysterious curse.

In DST, he received a character refresh on September 12, 2019.<ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/109374-warly-is-now-available-in-dst/ Warly is Now Available in DST!]. Posted on July 25, 2019</ref><ref>[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/111377-woodie-character-update-next-week-news/ Woodie Character Update Next Week + News!]. Posted on September 6, 2019</ref>

## Origin
{{#ev:youtube|https://youtu.be/d0r0WfV2y5s|alignment=left|dimensions=300}}
Woodie is notorious for having very little known about his character. His biography in DST's [[Compendium]] reveals a bit about himself:

''Hailing from the pine-covered mountains of the great white north, Woodie is an unassuming yet strangely mysterious man who keeps his past close to the vest (or in his case, the flannel). He is never seen without his signature bushy beard or trusty axe Lucy, who herself is a bit of an enigma. The other Survivors are not quite sure whether Woodie is simply mad, or if there might be something else to the seemingly inanimate object. Sometimes they swear they can hear a jovial female voice speaking to Woodie when no one else is around...''

In the animated short ''[[Animated shorts and trailers#Tree's A Crowd|Tree's A Crowd]]'', his DST exclusive forms Weremoose and Weregoose are given the spotlight. The short is officially summarized in the Compendium:

''As the power of the moon has grown, so too have the effects of Woodie's curse. Woodie soon found that his form would shift into not only the Werebeaver, but a Weremoose and Weregoose as well. As his changing forms became more unpredictable, Woodie resolved to find a way to have more control over his curse. Using every bit of knowledge he'd gained from his time in the Constant (and some additional tips from Ms. Wickerbottom) he soon discovered that his transformations could in fact be","Woodie, Canadian lumberjack, mysterious curse, transforms into Werebeaver, Weremoose, Weregoose."

# Health

**File:HealthMeter.png|thumb**

> ""For documenting my pain."" - Wendy

**Health** is a measurement of overall physical well-being. Unlike **Hunger** (and in many situations **Sanity**), Health typically does not drain over time. Health is lost instantly when a character is hit by an enemy attack, eats harmful food such as **Monster Meat**, eats **Rot**, or harvests from thorny plants like the **Spiky Bush**. In **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** (RoG), Health is lost instantly when harvesting from **Cacti**. Health is lost continually while the character is **burning**, **starving**, or **freezing**. In RoG, characters also lose Health while **overheating** and in **Don't Starve: Shipwrecked** (SW), while **poisoned**. Losing all Health results in **death** (although not necessarily the loss of the game). Health can be seen on the heart-shaped gauge in the upper-right corner of the screen, which shrivels and empties as the character's Health is depleted. Note that having a **Meat Effigy** lowers max Health. **Wanda** in DST does not have a health meter, instead, she has an age meter. Her meter corresponds approximately to 150 health.

| Character | Health |
| --- | --- |
| Wilson | 150 |
| Willow | 150 |
| Wolfgang | 200 |
| Wendy | 150 |
| WX-78 | 100 |
| Wickerbottom | 150 |
| Woodie | 150 |
| Wes | 113 |
| Maxwell | 75 |
| Wagstaff | 150 |
| Wigfrid | 200 |
| Webber | 175 |
| Walani | 120 |
| Warly | 150 |
| Wilbur | 125 |
| Woodlegs | 150 |
| Wilba | 150 |
| Wormwood | 150 |
| Wheeler | 100 |
| Winona | 150 |
| Wortox | 200 |
| Wurt | 150 |
| Walter | 130 |

* Wolfgang has 200 Health by default (his Health limit rises to 300 with a full belly and drops to 150 when starving). This is not true for **Don't Starve Together** as his health cap is only 200.

* WX-78 begins with 100 Health and is capable of increasing their Health Cap up to 400 by eating **Gears**. WX-78 begins 125 Health in **Don't Starve Together** and is capable of increasing their Health Cap by using **Hardy Circuit** and **Super-Hardy Circuit**s.

* Wilba's werepig form has 350 health.

* Wurt has 250 health when **King of the Merms** is alive.

**File:Slurtlethief.png|thumb|right|200px|Getting damaged depletes Health.**

## Healing

Health can be restored in a few ways. The most basic way to regain health is by eating **Food**, most of which typically provides 1-3 health when consumed. **Cooking** the food often increases the Health 1 or 2 points. There are also a few items whose sole purpose is to heal.

Wormwood is unable to gain health from eating food and must rely on other methods to restore it.

Certain food and items provide a greater health boost and are thus very valuable:

* **Crock Pot**: Several Crock Pot recipes provide substantial healing. **Fishsticks** [+40 hp] are an easy recipe to make. **Pierogi** [+40 hp] is a lot of people's go-to dish for its cheap recipe. **Dragonpie** [+40 hp] is excellent if the player manages to farm **Dragon Fruit**. In Shipwrecked, **Bisque** [+60 Hp] is food that can be easily produced, and is one of the most potent healing items in the game. However, regarding Crock Pot recipes in general, the player must make sure that the individual components (raw or cooked) won't heal more if eaten on their own.

* Cooked Crops: When cooked over a fire, **Eggplants**, **Potatoes**, **Dragon Fruit** and **Pomegranates** heal 20 hp.

* **Jerky**/**Small Jerky**: Jerky and Small Jerky restore 20 Hp and 8 Hp respectively and last for a very long time. If primary concern is health, and the player's only food source is **Meats**, they should be made into jerky. Jerky can be used in a **Crock Pot** as normal meat, if needed.

* **Spider Gland**/**Mosquito Sack**: **Spider","Health, damage, healing, food, Health restoration, character health values"

# Red Gem
The Red Gem is an Item used to craft several Magical items. It can be used to craft the Fire Staff, Night Light, Life Giving Amulet, and Purple Gem.

## Obtaining Red Gems
Red Gems can be obtained from Graves, as a drop from Red Hounds, from trading a Sextant to Wolly, from Earthquakes and Stalagmites in Caves, and from Ancient Statues, Broken Clockworks, and Ornate Chests in Ruins. They can also be found as a single, one time drop from hammering the Sunken Boat.

## Downloadable Content
### Reign of Giants
In the Reign of Giants DLC, Red Gems have a 0.02% chance to be dropped by Tumbleweeds.

### Shipwrecked
In the Shipwrecked DLC, Fishing with Trawl Net in deep Ocean has a small chance to catch a red gem. The chance is higher during Hurricane Season and Dry Season. Magma Piles in Magma Field biomes also have a chance to drop them.

### Hamlet
In Hamlet, Red Gems can be obtained by hammering A Smashing Pot, killing the Pugalisk, trawling in the Lily Ponds, finding them atop pedestals in Ancient Pig Ruins, and mining the Petrified Eggs in the BFB's nest.

## Usage

# Durability

Durability is a game-concept which limits the amount of usage an item or structure has. It generally applies to items which can be equipped, however there are some other items such as the [Sewing Kit] or [Pan Flute] which also have it. An item with durability can be identified by a percentage number in front of its inventory graphic. For example, an [Axe] will have a 100% over its icon when first created, and this number will change as the Axe is used. Different items use durability in different ways:

## Tools

[Tools] lose durability whenever they are used for their specific actions and in the same way as [weapons] do when attacking something. The 3 most common Tools ([Axe], [Pickaxe], and [Shovel]) also have special versions with a much higher durability ([Luxury Axe], [Opulent Pickaxe], and [Regal Shovel] respectively).

| Name | # of Uses | Special |
|------|-----------|---------|
| ![Axe] | 100 | Chops down [Evergreen|trees]. |
| ![Luxury Axe] | 400 | Chops down trees. |
| ![Pickaxe] | 33 | Mines [[:Category:Mineable Objects|mineable objects]]. |
| ![Opulent Pickaxe] | 132 | Mines mineable objects. |
| ![Shovel] | 25 | Digs up [[plants]]. |
| ![Regal Shovel] | 100 | Digs up plants. |
| ![Pitchfork] | 200 | Digs up [[turfs]]. |
| ![Hammer] | 75 | Deconstructs [[structures]]. |
| ![Sewing Kit] | 5 | Fixes up degraded clothing. |
| ![PickSlashAxe|Pick/Axe] | 400 as Axe (and weapon), 134 as Pickaxe | Chops trees and mines mineable objects. |
| ![Beefalo Horn] | 10 | Makes up to 5 [Beefalo] follow the player. |

## Survival items

[Survival] items lose durability when used by the player or when triggered by mobs. Some of them can be used as weapons but will lose durability much faster.

| Name | # of Uses | Special |
|------|-----------|---------|
| ![Bird Trap] | 8 | Captures [[Birds]]. |
| ![Trap] | 8 | Captures [[rabbit]]s and other small animals. |
| ![Fur Roll] | 3 | Restores [[sanity]] and [[health]] at the expense of [[hunger]]. |
| ![Tent] | 6 | Restores sanity and health at the expense of hunger. |
| ![Umbrella] | 20 (Only when attacking) | Prevents [[sanity]] loss from [[rain]]. |
| ![Bug Net] | 10 (4 when attacking) | Catches insects. |
| ![Fishing Rod] | 9 (3 when attacking) | Captures fish and eels in [[pond]]s. |
| ![Basic Farm] | 20 | Grows [[seeds]]. |
| ![Improved Farm] | 30 | Grows seeds faster. |

## Weapons

[Weapons] use Durability to determine the number of times they can hit something before breaking. A [Spear] for example losses 0.66% of its durability each time it is used to attack something, allowing it to be used 150 times. Each weapon has a different number of uses.

## Protection

Protective items include [Armor]s and [Walls]. Armors are items worn by the player. Armor's durability functions like extra [[Health]] for the character wearing it. Each type of Armor ([[Grass Suit]], [[Log Suit]], or [[Marble Suit]]) can absorb a certain amount of damage before breaking (225, 450, and 1050 respectively). When a character is hit, the armor takes a percentage of the total damage and the characters health takes the remainder. The number show on the armor's inventory icon is not actually the amount of damage it can still absorb, but the percentage of its own starting health (for example if a Grass Suit shows it has 50% durability left, it can still absorb 112 damage before breaking). Walls can be placed to protect or limit access to an area from other mobs. They can be attacked and destroyed, but can be repaired and even upgraded to last longer. [[Stone Wall]]s and [[Thulecite Wall]]s are the only non-flammable walls.

| Name | % Absorbed | Durability | Special |
|------|------------|-----------|---------|
| ![Hay Wall] | 100% | 50-100 | Flammable. |
| ![Wood Wall] | 100%","Durability, item usage limits, tool, weapon, armor wear and tear."

- **Links:** [Quotes](Wurt_quotes) / [Clothes](Wurt_clothes)

## Origin

Wurt is a Character exclusive to *Don't Starve Together*, who was released on October 24, 2019. Like Wortox, Wanda, and Wormwood, she needs to be unlocked, either by purchasing the Wurt Chest, Wurt Deluxe Chest, or Starter Pack addon to the Megapack Bundle or by weaving her with 2700 Spools. She is a young, curious Merm Guard.

Wurt's biography in the Compendium gives a bit of her backstory:

""Wurt is a little Merm girl who wants to bring her people back to their former glory (if they did indeed ever have a former glory... the evidence is a bit shaky on that front). A bit more open-minded than other Merms, she has taken to following the Survivors around and learning more about them. She is particularly fascinated by books with pretty pictures inside and an amazing thing the humans call ""candy"". Though she enjoys living in the swamp and being around other Merms, being the smallest and the youngest often makes her feel quite isolated, and she is enjoying the novelty of having some friends closer to her own age amongst the Survivors.""

In the animated short ""The Monster Marsh"", an instance of her meeting the survivors is showcased. On a Hallowed Nights night, Wickerbottom reads a scary story to Webber and Wendy as they sit around a Fire Pit in the swamp. They are attacked by a mob of Merms, who trample through their camp as they give chase. Wurt follows them until she steps on Wickerbottom's book (which looks like the popular fairy tale ""Hansel and Gretel""). She takes immediate interest in the story and sits at the base of a Spiky Tree as the survivors and Merms battle. After defeating the Merms and Spiders, a Tentacle takes them all out and one of their Candy Bags lands near Wurt. She helps herself to a piece of candy and continues to enjoy the book.

## Trivia

### In-Game

- Wurt's existence was accidentally leaked on October 12, 2019, when her Essential Wurt skin item was found in a Klei developer's Steam inventory.
- She has a unique idle animation in which she scratches one of her horns.
- When she was first implemented, she had many lines that implied she, like other Merms, could see in the dark. Most lines were later changed to remove reference to night vision. She will still say that she can ""still see"" when a Torch goes out, however.
- It was confirmed by Dan Sorce, a developer, that Wurt's voice is the combination of a sawtooth tone and the sound of gargling.
- Wurt's skull was found in the DST files as of May 6, 2021.
- Wurt's empowered appearance in her Toadstool costume is based on Misery Toadstool.
- The Victorian Wurt shows Wurt's transformation from a merm to a furry creature (apparently a goat). This is the opposite of what was shown in The Gorge event,","Wurt, Merm, DST, vegetarian, curious, swamp, books, candy"

## Usage

The Telelocator Staff is a magical Item created from the Magic Tab. It requires a Shadow Manipulator to prototype, and costs 2 Living Logs, 4 Nightmare Fuel, and 2 Purple Gems to craft. The Telelocator Staff has 5 uses. Each use costs 50 Sanity.

- **Usage**: The Telelocator Staff is used to teleport the player or Mob (including Bosses) to a random location on the map. When used on a mob, Lightning will strike the mob where it was standing before being teleported (possibly setting it on fire). When used on the player, lightning will strike them at the location used and also at the location they are teleported to (potentially causing fires both times). Each use will increase world's moisture, that when high enough can start Rain.

- **Caves**: Using a Telelocator Staff in Caves will not teleport the target (even if a Telelocator Focus was built underground), but will cause Rocks and Gems to fall at the location where the spell was used (similar to an Earthquake). Note that falling Minerals can cause damage to players and mobs.

## Telelocator Focus

If the player built a Telelocator Focus in the world and stocked it with three Purple Gems, the Telelocator Staff will teleport its target to the point at which the focus is placed instead of to a random location. This consumes the gems.

The player can use the Telelocator Focus to teleport to a base after a long trip or quickly travel from one end of the world to another.

Note that since it is currently not possible to teleport to or within a cave, building one of these in a cave is just a waste of resources.

## Downloadable Content

- **Reign of Giants**: When using the Staff on a mob, lightning may strike the player instead. WX-78 will always be hit, even when standing next to a Lightning Rod (causing both the character and the rod to be struck).

- **Shipwrecked**: Mobs in the ocean cannot be teleported.

- **Hamlet**: The Pugalisk cannot be teleported.

## Strategy

# Wilson Percival Higgsbury

**The Gentleman Scientist**

## Character Overview

- **Image**: ![Wilson](Wilson.png)
- **Motto**: ""I will conquer it all with the power of my MIND!""
- **Perk**: Grows a magnificent beard
- **Health**: 150
- **Hunger**: 150
- **Sanity**: 200
- **Spawn Code**: `wilson`
- **Birthday**: April 23
- **Survivability**: Slim
- **Favorite Food**: ![Bacon and Eggs](pic32|Bacon and Eggs)

## Origin

Wilson was the first of the playable characters to receive a backstory through an animated short, called **Forbidden Knowledge**. The events of this short were later officially summarized in DST's Compendium:

> While toiling away in his home laboratory late one night, Wilson was startled to hear a voice on the radio speaking directly to him. At first he feared he'd gone mad from too many late nights of experiments and accidentally-inhaled chemical fumes, but the voice assured him that it was no mere figment of the imagination. In fact, the voice had a proposition for him: if Wilson would build a machine according to their specifications, then he would be rewarded with secret knowledge, the likes of which no one had ever seen. Casting aside his better judgement (after all, what harm could come from making a vague bargain with a mysterious disembodied voice?) Wilson threw himself into constructing the machine. When at long last it was finally completed, the gentleman scientist had a moment of hesitation... a moment that might have saved him from his impending fate, had he been just a bit stronger of will. But at the voice's insistence, Wilson flipped the switch and activated his creation... and was never seen again. Well, at least not in this world.

## Trivia

### In-Game

- Wilson's voice is played by a ""Harmon muted trumpet (mixed with some cup muted trumpet as well)"".
- With a Puffy Vest, a Beefalo Hat, and the Beard at full length, Wilson can have the highest insulation factor in the game at 615.
- Wilson is one of the only three characters that get an insulation bonus from their Beard. The other two are Webber from Reign of Giants (RoG), and Woodie when played in DST.
- Wilson is the only character capable of producing Beard Hair from shaving. His Beard is also the only one to allegedly be made of human hair.
- Wilson is the only character unaffected by the Strange New Powers update, aside from Maxwell, who was not finished in time and got his new powers later on in the All's Well That Maxwell update.
- Wilson is the only character with no drawbacks. Even in RoG, his Beard needs to be grown to accelerate overheating in Summer, which is not required of Wilson during that season.
- Wilson has a skull in the game files.
- Before the November 14, 2013 patch, Wilson used to share a lot of examination quotes with the other characters. His quotes are also used as the default for every other playable character when new objects are implemented in a beta stage.
- Wilson can be used as a Steam chat emoticon.
- Team Fortress 2 promoted Don't Starve with a hat modeled after Wilson's hair, as well as a weapon based on the Ham Bat.
- When struck by Lightning in DLCs, Wilson, like most other characters, is shown to have bones in his hair.
- Due to the short ""Inevitable,"" Wilson is one of the few characters to have received actual voice acting, along with Maxwell, Charlie, and Willow.
- Wilson with Shadow Courtier can see Ink Blight's names.
- The Mad Lab Shoes were only added on August 31, 2022, despite the fact that the full set became available a few years earlier. Those who bought any set of skins that included the Wilson’s Mad Scientist skin received a red chest with Mad Lab Shoes upon entering the game. The chest appeared before the player could open the daily gift. Mad Lab Shoes were added in update 520864.
- All skins in Halloween Costumes Sets reference one mob from the game. Wilson's is the Guardian Pig.

### Lore

- From June to July 2012, a series of blog posts featured field notes written in Wilson's point of view, in which he recorded his initial experiences building tools, encountering Beefalo, and creating Meat Effigies in The Constant.
- Kevin Forbes has described Wilson as ""a person of independent means who has decided to apply his intellect, such as it is, to science,"" and has stated that despite identifying as one, Wilson is not a good scientist.
- Wilson's full name originates from promotional business cards Klei had made for a conference. Kevin Forbes originally wrote the name with Percival in","Wilson Percival Higgsbury, Gentleman Scientist, origin, attributes"

Standing next to the Mad Scientist Lab grants players access to the Mad Science Filter where they can conduct several experiments to produce potions. Each of these experiments causes the player to lose a certain amount of their Sanity.

Most of these experiments have several possible outcomes, however, they are all of positive effect for the players. As the cooking process takes a certain amount of time, their results are not immediately available for usage.

# Food

Food can be obtained by foraging, trapping, farming or hunting mobs. Food refills Hunger and may restore some Health along with Sanity, depending on the quality of the food eaten. Eating some foods, such as Monster Meat or Durians, can damage the player's health instead of restoring it. Some foods, such as raw Meat or Morsels, will damage a player's sanity if eaten. Mushrooms have varying effects on Health and Sanity depending on their color. Some special food items, such as Glow Berry, have additional effects when eaten.

Almost all raw food can be Cooked on a Campfire to increase the amount of Health/Hunger/Sanity restored or reduced, and sometimes remove Health/Sanity penalties from eating it. Some raw food items, most notably Meats, can be dried on a Drying Rack to produce long lasting food items with increased Health/Hunger/Sanity values. Additionally, a Crock Pot can be used for making foods that have additional benefits.

Food items also have other uses than eating them directly. Meat can be used as bait for carnivores, for the recruitment of Pigs, and as an offering to the Pig King for Gold Nuggets. A renewable way to gain Eggs is by giving meats to birds housed in Bird Cages. Meat is also a requirement to construct the Meat Effigy. Bunnymen can be befriended using Carrots and will become hostile if meat is in the player's inventory. Vegetables and Fruits can be used as bait for herbivores and given to Pigs to obtain Manure. Seeds can be used to bait Bird Traps.

Being of the most important items in the game, (and part of the game's namesake, to not starve) food is typically very valuable in any world; however, given the layouts of different maps and what spawns in them, food availability can vary from being abundant, to dangerously short. Food is affected by the seasons, which likely encourages the player to take advantages of seasonal diets and also take advantages of the food's shelf life.

With the introduction of Overheating mechanic in the Reign of Giants DLC (and carried over to Don't Starve Together and the Shipwrecked DLC), some foods are classified as hot or cold, providing an alternative way to combat Freezing and Overheating, respectively.

When players eat Foods that count as Meats, they will have a chewing animation and are not able to perform other actions for a relatively long duration. When eating Foods that are not Meats, they will just put it into their mouth very fast.

For Information on Food values and Priority, see the Crock Pot page.

## Perish Times

Most food and some non-edible items have a perish time, eventually turning into Rot, turning into another food or item, or disappearing completely.

| Stage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Green (50-100% Fresh) | Restores the full amount of Hunger, Health and Sanity for a given food. |
| Yellow (21-49% Stale) | Restores 2/3 of Hunger, 1/3 of Health for a given food and doesn't restore any Sanity. |
| Red (0-20% Spoiled) | Restores 1/2 of Hunger for a given food, doesn't restore any Health and decreases Sanity by 10. |

The Antlion is a Mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in A New Reign. It appears in the Desert biome during Summer Season. The players can either appease or kill it, otherwise, it creates Sinkholes on the surface or Cave-in Boulder when a player goes inside the caves. The Antlion can be given a Thermal Stone at stage 1 to freeze it and start combat, or one at stages 4 or 5 to set it on fire and start combat. (If you want to use a hot thermal stone, you need to heat it by Antlion as it will loose heat instantly away from fire in summer, making this impractical)

## Behavior
Antlion first spawns in Summer when there is no rain and the ground is dry. 33 minutes and 36 seconds (roughly four days) after it spawns it will disturb the players unless tribute is paid to delay it. When the attack is complete, Antlion's disturbance timer will be set to 80% of the previous calm duration.

If it rains while the Antlion is Alive, it will despawn, respawning later with a reset timer at 33 minutes 36 seconds when the rain stops.

### Tribute
Players can contribute the following items to delay the Antlion's disturbance:

| **Days** | **Items** |
| --- | --- |
| 1/3 | Rocks, Egg, Second-hand Dentures, Bent Spork, Air Unfreshener, Leaky Teacup, Shoe Horn, Collected Dust |
| 2/3 | Melty Marbles, Gord's Knot, Tiny Rocketship, Ball and Cup, Frayed Yarn, Wire Hanger, White Bishop, Black Bishop, White Rook, Black Rook, White Knight, Black Knight, Gnome, Gnomette, Frazzled Wires, Lying Robot, Beaten Beater, Fake Kazoo, Toy Trojan Horse, Unbalanced Top |

| 2 | Thermbell, Red Crown |
| 3 | Beach Toy |
| 4 | Heat Stone Stage 2, Heat Stone Stage 3 |

For example, if one gives the Antlion an Egg, it would delay its attacks for 160 seconds, or 1/3 day. Giving the Antlion 10 Rocks will delay the disturbance timer by 3.3 days. One should keep","Antlion, Don't Starve Together, Desert biome, Sinkholes, Tribute items"

**Dense Turf** is a craftable **Turf** **Item** introduced in the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. Like other Turfs, it can be placed on any bare ground tile or used as **Fire#Fuel**.

Dense Turf allows **Nettle Vine**s to grow and is also visually identical to the turfs found in the **Deep Rainforest** Biome. However, unlike the Deep Rainforest Turf, Dense Turf doesn't have randomly spawned jungle floor ferns that obstruct structure placement, shadows of leaves projected on the ground, a foliage effect on the sides of the screen, and it can be dug up with a **Pitchfork**.

**Grass Tuft**s planted on Dense Turf will grow into **Tall Grass** instead of normal one. Additionally, this turf allows **Cocooned Tree**s to convert regular **Rainforest Tree**s into cocooned ones.

When placed on the **Surface World** and covering a large enough area, no **Birds** will spawn and land on these turfs. In the **Shipwrecked** DLC, this Turf will not spawn **Flooding|Puddles**. Tides and expanding Puddles can still flood this turf, however.

## Trivia
- Dense Turf was added in the March 18, 2019 update.
- The fact that this soil is made with ash, and that when planting plants, they grow even higher level, can be a reference to the [terra preta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta) a soil made by the Brazilian natives with carbon ashes and organic waste that converted soils with poor mineral contents (jungle terrain) into farmland.

### '''Wendy Carter'''
Wendy Carter is the third playable [[Character]] in ''[[Don't Starve]]'' that can be unlocked via [[Experience]], with 640 XP, and one of the playable Characters in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' (DST). Wendy has a morbid personality; she always relates everything (even herself) to [[death]] and how depressing life is.

As part of the ''Don't Starve Together'' content updates, Wendy received a character refresh on March 19, 2020.<ref name=""forumpost"">[https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/116359-wendys-character-refresh-is-coming-next-week/ Wendy's Character Refresh is Coming Next Week!] Posted on March 12, 2020.</ref>

A glimpse into Wendy and Abigail's pasts were shown in the animated short ''[[Animated shorts and trailers#Wish You Were Here|Wish You Were Here]]''. Wendy and Abigail Carter used to live near a cliff side overlooking the ocean. Under mysterious circumstances, Abigail died. As a result, Wendy became severely depressed. She started to dabble in spiritualism. The ""Wendy's Nightstand"" [[Vignettes|Vignette]] shows her diary, in which she related a strange dream where she could hear ""the same song repeating over and over"", thinking it was Abigail trying to communicate with her.

This information is also summarized in her biography entry of DST's [[Compendium]]:

''Wendy's tale of woe began with the untimely loss of her dear sister Abigail. Unable to accept the thought of life without her twin, Wendy began turning to the occult in the hopes of finding some way to communicate with the other side. After much trial and error, séance candles burned down to nubs and spirit boards thrown away in frustration, Wendy was nearly ready to give up and fall into despair... until finally, there was a sign.

The **Brush** is a craftable **Item** found in the **Tools Tab**. It requires 1 **Steel Wool**, 1 **Walrus Tusk** and 2 **Gold** to craft, and an **Alchemy Engine** to prototype. When used on a **Beefalo** one **Beefalo Wool** will be obtained, obedience level increased by 40% and domestication by 1.6% (domestication level only increases once per day).

## {{pic32|Prototype}} Tips
- The Brush can be used multiple times on the same Beefalo, but will only be beneficial the first time it is used per day. Thus, it should be used once per day on each Beefalo that is being tamed.
- Using a **Deconstruction Staff** will give back all the materials, enabling the creation of endless brushes with only 1 required Steel Wool.

## {{pic32|Placeholder}} Trivia
- The Brush was first introduced to **Don't Starve Together**. It was later added to **Don't Starve** in the **Don't Starve/Version History|Quality of Life** update.
- The Brush is considered to be part of **A New Reign**, even though it was introduced before the official start of the beta branch.

The Cat Cap is a Category:Hats Item in the Don't Starve: Reign of Giants DLC. It is found in the Dress Tab, requires 1 Cat Tails and 4 Silk to craft and an Alchemy Engine to prototype. The Sewing Kit repairs 50% of its durability.

Cat Caps restore 3.3 Sanity/min while worn and are tier 1 warm clothing items, increasing the time a character can be without a fire during the Winter before Freezing. They have an insulation factor of 60.

Since Catcoons can easily go extinct on a map, and only drop their Cat Tails by chance, it is best to keep this Hat maintained with a Sewing Kit.

**Downloadable Content:**
Cat Caps are also included in the Don't Starve: Hamlet DLC, however, they cannot be crafted. Instead, they can be bought for 10 Oincs at The Sow's Ear Hat Shop in the Pig City.

**Trivia:**
- Since Catcoon is a portmanteau of ""cat "" and ""raccoon"", this item is most likely based on the real life Wikipedia:Coonskin_cap|Coonskin Cap, made most famous by the frontiersman Wikipedia:Davy_Crockett|Davy Crockett. Wickerbottom's quote references this by saying ""Not quite like Crockett's, but it'll do.""
- Visually, the Cat Cap also resembles an Wikipedia:Ushanka|Ushanka Cap.
- In older versions of Reign of Giants, the Cat Cap had resistance to wetness and was dropped outright by killing Catcoons.

## Hunger

Hunger is one of the primary game mechanics, as it's the measurement which determines whether or not the character is starving. As a character gets hungrier, this meter will empty, and the stomach pictured will shrivel.

The default maximum hunger for characters is measured at 150, though many characters have different maximum hunger amounts:

- Wolfgang (300) (200)
- WX-78 (100-200) (125-200)
- Wes (113) (75)
- Wagstaff (225)
- Wigfrid (120)
- Webber (175)
- Walani (200)
- Warly (250)
- Wilbur (175)
- Wilba (200)
- Wortox (175)
- Wurt (200-250)
- Walter (110)
- Wanda (175)

Hunger drains at 9.375 points per minute or 75 points per game day, except for: 

- Walani, drain hunger 10% faster (10.3125 or 82.5)
- Warly, drain hunger 33% faster (11.25 or 99.75)
- Wilbur, drain hunger 33% faster (11.25 or 99.75) only when running on all fours
- Warly, drain hunger 20% faster (11.25 or 90)
- Wes (singleplayer only), drain hunger 25% faster (12.46875 or 93.75)
- Wormwood, drain hunger 0%, 33%, 66%, 100% faster (9.375, 11.25, 15.5625, 18.75 or 75, 99.75, 124.6, 150)
- Wormwood, drain hunger 0%, 6%, 13%, 20% faster (9.375, 9.9375, 10.59375, 11.25 or 75, 79.5, 84.75, 90)
- Wolfgang (singleplayer only), drain hunger from 0 to 200% faster (from 9.375 to 28.125 or from 75 to 225)
- Wilba in her Werepig form, drain hunger 400% faster (46.875 or 375)

Hunger drain can also be slowed or accelerated:

- To 60% of base rate by equipping a Belt of Hunger
- To 75% of base rate by wearing the Hibernation Vest
- To 80% of base rate by poisoning
- To 75% of base rate by equipping Funcap
- If a Slurper jumps onto the player it will start draining 3 points of hunger every 2 seconds and keep doing so, until it's detached from the head slot.
- Walter loses only half the normal hunger when Sleeping.
- Winona will drain 5 hunger when she speed-crafts something.
- Wolfgang has faster hunger drain when using the Mighty Gym.
- WX-78 has 20% slower hunger drain when using the Super-Gastrogain Circuit.

![Wilson hungry](Wilson_hungry.png)

When the Hunger meter is emptied, Health will begin to drain at 1.25 points per second until something is eaten or the character dies. Most food will restore the Hunger meter when eaten. The amount restored depends on the food eaten; cooked food typically restores more than raw food. Some","Hunger game mechanic, character quotes, hunger meter, health loss."

# Mobs

Mobs, or ""Mobiles"", are game entities which move around, technically creatures including Monsters and Animals. The term has been a part of video game jargon since 1978; it's not unique to Don't Starve.

Every Mob has its own unique behaviors, movements, attacks, drops, and uses. As such, learning the characteristics of each and every Mob becomes important to survival, done either through direct study and interaction or through external research.

Many mobs can be put to sleep by the pan flute and other features in the game.

## Classification

### Hostile Mobs
Hostile Mobs are always aggressive. These mobs attack anything nearby which they deem threatening.

### Neutral Mobs
Neutral Mobs are non-aggressive until provoked. Their threat is very often getting attacked, but it might be just about anything except proximity.

### Passive Mobs
Passive Mobs are always non-aggressive, even when attacked. These mobs will typically avoid the player, but exceptions exist.

These relationships are classified with regards to each others. A Mob which is hostile/neutral/passive towards all other Mobs is a true hostile/neutral/passive Mob.

For monstrous player characters (Webber and Wortox) some mobs are categorized differently. Bunnymen, Pigs and Catcoons will be hostile to them since these mobs attack monsters on sight, though Spiders will be neutral to Webber. Pigs will also be hostile to Wurt due to her being a Merm, but Bunnymen and Catcoons will be neutral.

## Characteristics

### Health (HP)
Health is measured in ""Hit Points"" (HP), an arbitrary unit invented to coordinate with damage.
Each hit taken from the player decreases its health by:
- attack damage * character damage multiplier
The number of hits required to kill a Mob is:
- Hits = mob health / attack damage

### Damage (DMG)
Damage is a subtraction of health from a Mob, measured in HP.
A hit against any Mob deals:
- attack damage = base attack damage / mob's armor

### Attack Period (AP)
The time from the start of one attack to the start of the next one, here measured in seconds.
A Mob's damage per second (or DPS) is calculated by either of the following
- DPS = total damage done / time taken
- DPS = attack damage / attack period

### Attack Range (AR)
The distance an attack can hit a target from, here measured in ""units"" which are equal to the horizontal thickness of a Wall, with the diagonal thickness of a Wall being √2 units.

### Sanity Aura (SA)
The amount of sanity a player gains or loses per minute when standing near the Mob.

### Walk Speed (WS) and Run Speed (RS)
Walk Speed is a mob's speed while idly wandering the world, and Run Speed is a mob's speed while either engaged in combat or fleeing. They are measured in units per second. The default Run Speed of most characters is 6.

The speed is affected by the mob's scaled size (determined by looking for inst.Transform:SetScale(X, X, X) in the mob's lua file), so the in-game speed is calculated as:
- WS/RS = speed * scale value

# Crafting

Crafting is an in-game mechanic that allows players to craft or make Items and Structures. This is done by selecting an item or structure to be crafted in one of the 19 Crafting Tabs (including DLCs, and Character-Specific tabs). Provided the player has sufficient materials in their inventory and, if necessary, has unlocked the item recipe, they will receive 1 or more of the crafted item. Below are the crafting tables for the different game modes available. The availability of crafting recipes are further affected by special Events.

## Unlocked

Unlocking for the first time will grant the player 15 Sanity. Once unlocked, items can be crafted any time.

### Prototype

Generally, each Item or Structure must be ""prototyped"" at a particular Prototyper or through other means to be unlocked. Once the item has been unlocked, it can be crafted anywhere, anytime (so long as the required materials are available). Tier 1 items can be unlocked at either a Science Machine or Alchemy Engine. Tier 2 items can only be unlocked at an Alchemy Engine, ETC.

Standing near the Prototyper allows prototyping new recipes. The following is a list of all the Prototypers:

- Science Machine
- Alchemy Engine
- Prestihatitator
- Shadow Manipulator
- Bookcase
- Think Tank
- Tackle Receptacle
- Terra Firma Tamper
- Sawhorse

### Blueprint

### Webber's Switcherdoodle

## Crafting Station

Crafting Station is similar to Prototyper, except that they do not unlock the recipe for the player after they make it, so the player must return to Crafting Station if they want to make the item again.

The following is a list of all the Crafting Station:

- Ancient Pseudoscience Station
- Cartographer's Desk
- Potter's Wheel
- Rock Den
- Celestial Orb
- Celestial Altar
- Celestial Tribute
- Celestial Sanctum
- Brightsmithy
- Shadowcraft Plinth
- Portable Grinding Mill
- Benevolent Rabbit King
- Masonry Oven
- Mad Scientist Lab
- Gobbler Shrine
- Varg Shrine
- Pig Shrine
- Carrat Shrine
- Beefalo Shrine
- Catcoon Shrine
- Bunnyman Shrine
- Dragonfly Shrine
- Trinket Trove Filter
- Cawnival Creation Filter

## Crafting Filter

In Don't Starve Together, the Crafting menu has been redesigned to accommodate more items, with filters replacing categories.

### Unimplemented Filters

Unimplemented Filters - Filter that are unused in the game and founded in game files

## Don't Starve Together Quick-Craft Tabs

In Don't Starve Together, the crafting sidebar UI has been redesigned into Quick-Craft Tabs which allow the player to quickly craft items and structures. The player can use up to 9 pages of quick-craft tabs, with each page holding up to 9 recipes maximum. Keybinds can be set to quickly page left and right between pages. Moreover, mouse-wheeling over a particular tab changes the Belongings skin of that item or structure.

## Craftable Items and Structures

## Tips

* Whenever an item is unlocked, the player's Sanity will be restored by 15 points. This is only when prototyping the item and not during subsequent construction of that item. Therefore, a very simple tactic for healing sanity is to hold off on prototyping new items until needing the sanity.

## Trivia

* Prior to the ""Hungry for your Hunger"" update, the Shadow Manipulator functioned as a ""level 3"" crafting station. It could research all the same items as the Alchemy Engine and Science Machine before the science and magic crafting trees were separated.
* In the early beta of Don't Starve, the game used a ""Research points"" system instead of prototyping","crafting, items, structures, tabs, prototype, sanity, recipes, crafting stations, filters."

## Scrapbook Info
This needs some fertilizing after planting. | Banana Bushes (Item)

## Description
Banana Bushes are Plants exclusive to Don't Starve Together, introduced in The Curse of Moon Quay update. They can be found growing on Moon Quay and are dropped in their item form from the Unnatural Portal.

A Banana Bush will grow 1 Banana at a time after several growing stages. Similar to Berry Bushes, it can be replanted when dug up with a Shovel but will need to be fertilized before it will start growing new fruit. The bush will need to be re-fertilized after multiple harvests.

## Bugs
Despite having the MakeNoGrowInWinter() component, Banana Bushes will continue to grow during Winter.

# Combat Damage Mechanics

Combat is a gameplay mechanism that allows players or mobs to fight each other, reducing each other's health. When a player or mob is attacked or exposed to an environmental hazard, a series of calculations determine how much damage is taken and how much health is lost.

## Damage

### Physical Damage
Physical Damage is the most common type of damage in the game. Every mob, before enabling Rifts, only deals physical damage that can be absorbed by Armor's Protection or reduced by mobs' Planar Entity Protection. Physical Damage can be affected by damage multipliers, such as:

- **Wes**, **Wendy**: deal 25% less damage.
- **Wigfrid**: deal 25% more damage.
- **Wolfgang**: deal x0.75 - x2 damage, based on his mightiness.
- **Wanda**: based on her age and weapon she uses.
- **Volt Goat Chaud-Froid**: grants a x1.5 damage boost (x2.5 when target is wet) for 5 minutes.
- Dishes with **Chili Flakes**: deal 20% more damage for 4 minutes.
- **W.A.R.B.I.S. Head Gear**: gives 5% - 20% physical damage boost.

#### Weapons with Physical Damage
Almost every Weapon deals physical damage, more or less. It is recommended for players to get a **Ham Bat** or **Dark Sword** for their high damage. These weapons, however, will not be as efficient against Rift mobs with Planar Entity Protection.

### Planar Damage
Planar Damage is a new type of damage introduced in ""From Beyond"", and it does not get affected by the damage multipliers mentioned above. Unlike Physical Damage, Planar Damage cannot be blocked by Armor's Protection or reduced by Planar Entity Protection. It is only affected by Armor's Planar Defense or Damage Reduction.

#### Creatures with Planar Damage

| Mobs | Physical Damage | Planar Damage |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Grazer** | 50 | 10 |
| **Deadly Brightshade** | 65 (100 When attacked) | 10 (30 When attacked) |
| **Fused Shadeling** | 40 (50 {{pic|24|Fused Shadeling Bomb}}) | 10 (20 {{pic|24|Fused Shadeling Bomb}}) |
| **Shriek** | 25 | 30 |
| **Jitters** | 35 | 20 |
| **Rasp** | 20 | 20 |
| **Armored Bearger** | 87 | 30 |
| **Crystal Deerclops** | 75 | 30 |
| **Possessed Varg** | 50 (20 coldfire) | 20 |
| **Bright-Eyed Frog** | 10 | 5 |

#### Weapons with Planar Damage

| Weapons | Physical Damage | Planar Damage |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Brightshade Sword** | 38 | 30 |
| **Brightshade Bomb** | 0 | 200 |
| **Brightshade Staff** | 0 | 10 |
| **Brightshade Smasher** | 32.5 | 10 |
| **Brightshade Shoevel** | 17.2 | 10 |
| **Shadow Reaper** | 38-41.8 | 18-23 |
| **Howlitzer** | 34 | 34 |
| **Charged Elding Spear** | 74.37 (111.5 wetness) | 20 |

### Other Damage
- Damage that cannot be reduced in any way: spending Health for crafting (such as crafting a Meat Effigy).
- Damage that cannot be blocked by armor, but can be reduced by Damage Reduction:
  - Food
  - Starving
  - Freezing
  - Overheating
  - Fire
  - Acid Rain
  - Wetness (WX-78 only)
  - Lightning: including charged Volt Goat, hammering Moose/Goose Egg, and Moongleam.
- Walter takes a fixed 10 damage from Bees.

### Additional Damage Multiplier
Here are some additional damage multipliers that affect both Physical Damage and Planar Damage.

- Characters with a **Skill Tree** can choose Lunar Affinity or Shadow Affinity.
  - Lunar Affinity: +10% protection from Lunar Aligned mobs and +10% damage to Shadow Aligned mobs.
  - Shadow Affinity: +10% protection from Shadow Aligned mobs and +10% damage to Lunar Aligned mobs.
- {{Pic32|Brightshade Sword}} deals 10% more total damage to Shadow Aligned mobs.

## Description

A Blueprint is an Item that lets the player learn a craftable recipe without having to prototype it first. When used, it restores 15 sanity. Blueprints themselves do not actually create an item; they only allow the player to craft the item away from the station normally used to prototype it.

Blueprints can be found in some Set Pieces and at the beginning of each world in Adventure Mode. The player can find more than one Blueprint that unlocks the same recipe, and all Blueprints will restore Sanity when used, even if the player has already researched the item.

The Bundling Wrap recipe can only be obtained from a Blueprint dropped by a Bee or Killer Bee.

## Downloadable Content

In the Reign of Giants DLC, Blueprints can also be obtained by destroying Tumbleweeds in Sandbox Mode. It is possible to find Blueprints for items in the Ancient Tab, but an Ancient Pseudoscience Station will still be needed to actually craft the item. Ancient Tab Blueprints do not restore any Sanity. The Old Bell recipe can only be obtained from a Blueprint dropped by a mined Glommer's Statue.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, Blueprints can be obtained from X Marks the Spot treasure chests.

In the Hamlet DLC, both the Vortex Cloak and Living Artifact recipes can only be obtained from Blueprints which drop from the Ancient Herald and the Large Iron Hulk, respectively.

## Trivia

- If the player uses the console to make all recipes available, all random Blueprints spawned will be called ""MISSING NAME"".
- There are currently 21 items that can only be researched through Blueprints, which are the Bundling Wrap, the Old Bell in Reign of Giants, the Vortex Cloak and Living Artifact in Hamlet, and the End Table, Red Funcap, Green Funcap, Blue Funcap, Glowcap, Mushlight, Napsack, Desert Goggles, Scaled Furnace, 6 Replica Relics, The Lazy Deserter, and the Strident Trident in Don't Starve Together.
- There are different console commands for each prototypical item in the game. e.g., to spawn a Blueprint for a Spear, the following command should be used: c_spawn(""spear_blueprint"").

# Chess Pieces

## Overview
Chess Pieces are craftable objects exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. There are eight different variants that can be crafted at a **Potter's Wheel** and are mostly meant for decoration. Nearly all of them are unlocked by giving their respective **Sketch** to the Potter's Wheel, except for the Bubble Pipe Carving and the Carved Hornucopia, which are always available. Players are able to sculpt Chess Pieces out of two **Rocks** and one **Marble**, **Cut Stone** or **Moon Shard**. The chosen material determining the color of the crafted Chess Piece.

Chess Pieces can be carried by players in the chest slot, similar to **Suspicious Marble**, slowing down their movement speed and preventing them from several inventory actions, such as equipping a handheld item.

## Variants

### Carved Hornucopia
- A sculpture for a starving artist.
- Sculpture depicts a **Cornucopia**, a horn of plenty which can be depicted as a horn-shaped, hollow bread filled with food. The shape of the horn resembles a **Beefalo Horn**. The sculpture may be a reference to the fact that a Cornucopia is an over-used example of pottery.

### Bubble Pipe Carving
- Stick this on your wheel and sculpt it.
- The sculpture depicts a **Bubble Pipe** which is a toy that acts similarly to a bubble-blowing stick, except it's shaped like a tobacco pipe. The sculpture is possibly a reference to **Markus Raetz**'s pipe sculpture which can be interpreted as either a tobacco pipe or a shapeless metal blob.

### Anchor Figure
- Ground your base with a stone anchor.
- The sculpture depicts an anchor using to stop the boat. Its Sketch can be crafted in **Seafaring Filter** at **Think Tank**.

### Pawn Figure
- It takes a village to raise an army.
- The sculpture depicts a pawn from the board game **Chess**. It may be a reference to giant chess pieces.

### Rook Figure
- Next best thing to an actual castle.
- The sculpture depicts a rook from the board game **Chess**. It also bears resemblance to the nose of a **Clockwork Rook**, which when hammered during a **New Moon** can spawn a **Shadow Version** of itself (**Marble** and **Cut Stone** only). It may be a reference to giant chess pieces.

### Knight Figure
- Shining armor not included.
- The sculpture depicts a Knight from the board game **Chess**. It also bears resemblance to the head of a **Clockwork Knight**, which when hammered during a **New Moon** can spawn a **Shadow Version** of itself (**Marble** and **Cut Stone** only). It may be a reference to giant chess pieces.

### Bishop Figure
- A chesspiece with a checkered past.
- The sculpture depicts a bishop from the board game **Chess**. It also bears resemblance to a head of a **Clockwork Bishop**, which when hammered during a **New Moon** can spawn a **Shadow Version** of itself (**Marble** and **Cut Stone** only). It may be a reference to giant chess pieces.

### Queenly Figure
- The most powerful piece on the board.
- The sculpture depicts a queen from the board game **Chess**, though it appears more like a Greek tragedy actor. Its overall style and the fact that it is carrying a mask may be a reference to the Greek Muse of Tragedy, **Melpomene**.

### Kingly Figure
- Behind every queen is a dapper king.
- The sculpture depicts a king from the board game **Chess**, though it appears more like a suited man. The fact that it has no arms may be a reference to the sculpture **Venus de Milo**.

### Moon Moth Figure
- This sculpture's a moth-have.
- The sculpture depicts a **Moon Moth**. Its Sketch can be crafted in **Celestial Filter** at **Lunar Altars** or upgraded **Celestial Orb**.

### ""Moon"" Figure
- It's a selene figurine!
- The sculpture depicts the ""Moon"". Its Sketch can be crafted in **Celestial Filter** at **Lunar Altars** or upgraded **Celestial Orb**.

## Trivia
- Most Chess Pieces were added in the **Arts and Crafts** update, while the Giant Figures were introduced in an unnamed **Bonus Update** after the completion of **A New Reign**. The Bee Queen, Toadstool, Antlion, Ancient Fuelweaver, and Klaus Figures were added in the **March 2022 QoL update**.
- Based off of character quotes, it is implied that the Kingly Figure refers to","Don't Starve Together, A New Reign, Potter's Wheel, Chess Pieces, Rock, Marble, Cut Stone, Moon Shard."

## Description
Wickerbottom is the fifth playable Character in Don't Starve that can be unlocked via Experience, with 1280 XP, and one of the playable Characters in Don't Starve Together (DST). She is an old, intelligent librarian who self-publishes and is able to identify many different types of fauna and flora by their scientific names.

## Origin
Wickerbottom's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled [One For the Books](https://youtu.be/15ESUxxJvZs). An official summary of the short was provided in DST's Compendium:

""When people meet Ms. Wickerbottom, most assume that what you see is what you get. She certainly looks every bit the typical librarian that she claims to be, as at home amongst the bookstacks as any creature in their native habitat. Nobody would raise an eyebrow at such a person being well-versed in a wide range of subjects. Who would spare a second thought if, upon further inquiry, her knowledge rivaled that of experts? And obviously, no one would think of questioning what a librarian might be involved in after hours, when the library doors are closed to the public....""

## Trivia
### In-Game
- Wickerbottom was added to Don't Starve in the Progress! update on January 29, 2013.
- Wickerbottom is played by an oboe.
- Wickerbottom's eyes are shut by default, but open sometimes, like when she exits a Worm Hole or is low on Sanity.
  - In DST, Wickerbottom is able to be put to sleep by a Pan Flute in PVP mode or by Bearger's yawn. Due to this, players are able to see that Wickerbottom sleeps with her eyes open, most likely due to her insomnia.
- While unable to sleep, Wickerbottom is still able to be knocked out by cooking a Mandrake or consuming a Cooked Mandrake.
- Wickerbottom has a skull in the game files.
- Wickerbottom's previous perk, before the Strange New Powers update, was to be able to prototype one tier higher than the other Characters, including Magic Items.
- When struck by Lightning in DLCs, Wickerbottom, like most other Characters, is shown to have bones in her hair. In addition to this, she also has bones in her skirt and shoes.
- Wickerbottom was the only female playable Character to have pupils and black, beady eyes, before Winona's release.
  - She is also the only character with separated pupils.

### Lore
- Wickerbottom's first name is unknown.
- Wickerbottom is fond of seafood, judging from her examination quotes for various fish dishes and her favorite food.
- Wilson believes that Wickerbottom has, or at least used to have, a pet cat. When Wickerbottom examines the Lucky Cat Jar, she sighs, and when she examines a Kittykit, she says ""Now it feels like home."", which provides further evidence to this. This is also later confirmed in her animated short, One For the Books.
- When examining her book Birds of the World, she says that the Western screech owl is her favorite. This is also the particular bird species in The Screecher.
- She is the most literate of the Don't Starve characters and always refers to animals by their scientific names. The only exceptions to this are the creatures that are completely unknown to her. This can provide information as to what creatures in the Constant exist in her homeworld.
- She kept a garden at home, according to her quotes for a Potted Succulent (""I wonder how my garden is doing without me."") and Bloomfin Tuna (""Oh my, you'd look right at home in my old garden."").
- Wickerbottom's loading screen vignette from The Forge is accompanied by text that reveals a bit of her love of books: ""Delightfully, Ms. Wickerbottom has found her passion for the written word has only deepened as the years","Wickerbottom, librarian, self-publishes books, high sanity, hates food spoilage"

# Crock Pot

The **Crock Pot** is a **Structure** used to **Cooking|cook** a variety of belly-filling dishes from basic **Food**s. Found in the **Food Tab**, it requires a **Science Machine** to prototype, and costs 3 **Cut Stone**, 6 **Charcoal**, and 6 **Twigs** to build.

While enhancing **Food**'s value and efficiency; it can even make use of otherwise inedible items like **Twigs**.

## Usage

With 4 slots for ingredients, each must be filled with a piece of Food to start cooking. Most recipes take 10–20 seconds to cook (Exact times for each recipe are listed **below**). Completed Crock Pot dishes can be stacked to 40; none of them can be used in the Crock Pot again.

### Cooking basics

A cooking attempt's ingredients have to match a **Dishes#All Dishes|recipe**. There are 58 recipes available for the Crock Pot, including those from the **DLCs**. If an attempt fails to match any recipe at all, **Wet Goop** ends up as the product.

When a recipe is attempted (i.e. the pot starts cooking), the **#Food groups|food groups** the ingredients fit into are considered; almost all recipes require some amount of Food from certain food groups, but there are many recipes with specific Food requirements (like **Froggle Bunwich**).

Lots of ingredients fulfill recipe requirements more readily than others (e.g. 1 **Drumstick** has the same effect on a dish as 2 **Morsel**s). More filling ingredients tend to have greater **#Food values|food values**.

Each recipe has weight, called **#Priority|recipe priorities**, so a result can be decided when a set of ingredients fits more than one valid recipe. These weights are.

When **Food#Food Spoilage|spoiled** ingredients are used, the completed dish's spoil percentage becomes half the average spoil percentage of the ingredients (e.g. if 1 monster meat and 3 berries, all 90% spoiled (10% fresh), are placed in the Crock Pot, the resulting meatball will be 45% spoiled (55% fresh)). Non-spoilable ingredients are ignored when calculating average spoil percentage. In the vanilla game, a meal doesn't begin to spoil until a player removes it from the Crock Pot. Meals remain in the Crock Pot until either a player removes it, a **Lureplant** ""eats"" it, or the pot is destroyed.

## Downloadable Content

In **DLC**s, Crock Pot dishes start to **Rot|spoil** (even quicker in **rain**) before being collected. Some existing recipes gain the ability to warm or cool the player and new recipes have been added which can lower or raise the player's temperature. The Crock Pot itself also generates heat when cooking, which may **Overheating|Overheat** the player during **Summer** and **Dry Season**.

If a regular or RoG save file has been set to be compatible with SW, any recipes added by SW will also be available in such a file. Consequently, recipes such as Surf 'n' Turf can be created to easily restore large amounts of Health and Sanity in the Ruins by combining 2 Monster Meats with 2 Eels.

The **Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet** DLC introduces the first Crock Pot recipe that turns into a different recipe when it has spoiled. **Tea** will spoil after one day, but instead of becoming **Rot** it will become **Iced Tea**. Even though this transformation likely represents the cooling of the hot drink, putting Tea in an **Ice Box** will slow its spoilage like any other food item. **Foliage** can be used in the Crock Pot in this DLC.

## Tips

* The light emitted by an active Crock Pot is enough to keep **Charlie** away.
* **Warly** has his own **Portable Crock Pot**.
* Some Crock Pot dishes give fewer **Hunger** / **Health** points than the sum of their components.
  * For instance, it's better to eat four **Roasted Carrot**s (+12 **Hp** / +50 **Hunger**), versus using them to make **Ratatouille** (+3 **Hp** / +25 **Hunger**); however, most Crock Pot recipes restore 5 **Sanity**, which may be desirable.
  * Putting any 4 edible items in the pot will result in something.
* If the player has enough resources to create a 5-6 fit Crock Pot setting, the player can position them in a quintet or","Crock Pot, cooking, food, recipes, DLC, spoil, temperature, Hamlet, Tea, Ice Box."

# Star Caller's Staff

The **Star Caller's Staff** is a craftable [[Item]] found in the [[Ancient Tab]]. It requires 4 [[Nightmare Fuel]], 2 [[Living Log]]s, 2 [[Yellow Gem]]s, and a broken [[Ancient Pseudoscience Station]] to craft. It also can randomly drop from an Ancient Pseudoscience Station when damaged with a [[Hammer]], [[Gunpowder]] etc., and has a 25% chance to be found inside a [[Large Ornate Chest]]. Like all items from the Ancient Tab, Star Caller's Staves cannot be prototyped and can only be made near an Ancient Pseudoscience Station.

With each use of the staff, the Survivor holding it will lose 20 {{sanity}} and the Staff will lose 5% of its [[Durability]] to summon a Dwarf Star. Due to the nature of [[Darkness]], the Dwarf Star cannot be summoned directly in the middle of Darkness, so more preemptive measures are needed to avoid being bitten by the Night Monster.

## Dwarf Star

### Object Infobox
- **name**: Dwarf Star
- **image**: Dwarf Star.gif
- **perk**: Provides light, heat.<br>Can cook.
- **durability**: 3.5 days
- **sanitybonus**: +25/min<br>+35/min ([[File:Willow Portrait.png|24px|link=Willow]])
- **spawnCode**: ""stafflight""
- **spawnFrom**: {{pic24|Star Caller's Staff}}, {{pic|24|Ancient Pseudoscience Station}} ({{pic24|Hammer}})

When equipping the Star Caller's Staff in the hand slot, it can be used on any visible point on the ground to summon a Dwarf Star (it can also be randomly summoned by hitting an [[Ancient Pseudoscience Station]] with a hammer).

A single Dwarf Star will last 28 minutes (3.5 in-game days). With 20 uses, this means a single staff will yield a total of 70 days of Dwarf Stars. During that time it provides a fluctuating radius of light, heat equivalent to that of a 3rd tier [[Campfire]] fire (180 units; the 4th and highest tier is 220 units of heat) and a [[Sanity]] boost of 25 {{sanity}} per minute while standing near it.

The Dwarf Star can also be used to [[Cooking|cook]] [[Food]], similar to a Campfire. It can also burn flammable objects that are too close to it, so caution is advised as to where the staff is used.

## Downloadable Content

In the ''[[Reign of Giants]]'' DLC, the Dwarf Star provides the highest amount of heat instead (more than a fully fueled Fire Pit) and standing near it for too long can cause [[Overheating]], even during [[Winter]].

## Tips

* It's a good idea to equip a [[Construction Amulet]] when crafting this Staff, to save one [[Yellow Gem]].
* While the Staff cannot be used in the dark, it can still be used a few seconds before complete darkness settles in. The light given off when summoning the Dwarf Star will provide protection from [[Charlie]].
* Staying close to the Dwarf Star will cause a net bonus of 30{{sanity}}. Excluding outside factors, this results in no Sanity cost from using the Staff.
  * [[Willow]]'s Sanity regeneration perk works with the Dwarf Star too resulting in 50{{sanity}} recovered.
  * There is no limit to the amount of Dwarf Stars that players can summon at the same time and their Sanity boosts stack with each-other. This means that players can summon multiple Dwarf Stars at the same spot to boost their Character's Sanity quicker.

## Trivia

* The Star Caller's Staff was added in the ''[[Don't Starve/Version History|Hungry For Your Hunger]]'' update. Its crafting requirement was changed during the ''[[Don't Starve/Version History|Stuff of Nightmares]]'' update.

## Fire
Fire is a commonly-occurring game mechanic.

Fire is very important for various reasons. Primarily, it is used to provide light at [Night](#), which prevents [Charlie (Night Monster)](#) from attacking. Additionally, fire allows food to be [Cooking](#), increasing its [Hunger](#) and [Health](#) values. Fire also provides warmth during [Winter](#), which counteracts [freezing](#). Despite these benefits however, fire can also be dangerous, as being too close to one will drain Health.

Flaming items or objects may have different descriptions than non-burning ones; for example, a burning log versus one that's just sitting there.

### Light
There are several sources of fire which provide light. Most of these can be found in the [Light Tab](#), represented by the Campfire icon. These sources include [Campfire](#)s, [Fire Pit](#)s, [Torch](#)es, or [Star](#)s. Additionally, anything actually on fire, such as [Plants](#) or [Flammable Objects](#), will give off light as long as they are burning.

Light serves several purposes: mainly it is used to see at night, though it is also needed to prevent [Night Monster](#) from attacking. Additionally, light prevents the large [Sanity](#) loss from being in total darkness (however, it does not prevent the gradual loss caused by Dusk/Night time). If Sanity does drop too low, [Night Hand](#)s will begin to approach the fire and extinguish portions of it; eventually they may put it out completely. These hands can be scared off by stepping on them and running them towards the edge of the fire's light.

### Cooking
[Main|Cooking]  
Fire Pits, Campfires, or Stars can be used to cook foods. [Cooking](#) has various positive effects. For most foods, the amount of Hunger they restore is increased and a small Health boost is added. Eating raw [Meats](#) decreases Sanity, while cooked meats do not. Additionally, [Monster Meat], eaten raw, will reduce Health and Sanity, but these effects are lessened with cooking.

### Warmth
[Main|Freezing]  
In Winter, characters will begin to freeze if they are away from fire for too long (warm clothing helps prevent this). As long as the character is within a certain radius of a fire, they will stay warm. This includes any burning objects like trees. Fires can also warm [Thermal Stone](#)s, which can be carried around to slow down freezing.

### Fire Damage
Objects, items, and Mobs that are on fire can cause 8-12 [hp] damage per second if they are too close to the player. Most mobs will also take fire damage, when on fire, or when they are close to open fires, which can be used as an offensive tactic.

The following are immune to fire damage/being set on fire:

- Both:
  - [Willow](#)
  - [Red Hound](#)
  - [Dragonfly](#)
  - [Dragoon](#)
  - [Gnat Swarm](#)
  - [Large Iron Hulk](#)
  - [Abigail](#)
  - [Crawling Horror](#)
  - [Ghost](#)
  - [Saladmander](#)
  - [Terrorbeak](#)

- Immune to being set on fire but not fire damage:
  - [Frog](#)
  - [Houndius Shootius](#)
  - [Depths Worm](#)
  - [Tentacle](#)
  - [Big Tentacle](#)
  - [Baby Tentacle](#)
  - [Elephant Cactus](#)

{{Quote|I put stuff there!|Wolfgang}}
## Inventory
The **Inventory** is a section of the [[Wikipedia:User Interface|User Interface]] where the player character's held [[Item]]s are displayed and accessed during gameplay.

The player can hold up to fifteen different stacks of items in the Inventory. Equipable Items can be placed in their respective equipment slot.
![An empty Inventory bar.](Inventory Empty.PNG =414x414px)

- The first fifteen slots holds all types of items, minus [[Backpack]]s.
- The ""left hand"" slot allows the character to equip a [[Tools Tab|Tool]] or [[Weapon]].
- The body slot is reserved for [[Armor]], [[Clothing]] or Backpacks.
- The head slot is reserved for head Armor or hats.
- The hidden ""right hand"" slot is for items held directly with the player's cursor.

Using the three equip slots, one can equip Armor, Clothing, [[Weapon]]s and [[Tool]]s, applying them visually to the character. Most equipped clothing gives the character resistance to [[Freezing]] or [[Overheating]], and some restore [[Sanity]] over time. Equipped Armor absorbs a percentage of damage taken from enemy attacks and certain environmental hazards. Equipped tools are used to harvest [[Tree]]s, mine [[Boulder]]s, catch [[Fish]], destroy [[Structures]], and other functions important to survival. 
![A full Inventory. The player has equipped a [[Walking Cane]], a [[Log Suit]], and a [[Battle Helm]].](Inventory snip.PNG =414x414px)

Most equipable items have limited durability, indicated by numeric percentages displayed over their Inventory icons. These items lose durability as they are used and most are destroyed when the percentage drops to zero. [[Food#Perish Times|Perishable]] items are indicated by a colored meter in the backdrop of the slot they're held in. The meter decreases and changes color, from green, to yellow, to red as items spoil, losing their effectiveness.

Most items in the Inventory can **stack**, allowing the player to carry multiples of the same item in a single slot, leaving more space for other items. Items will stack up to 40, 20 or 10, depending on the type. Most equippable items do not stack, and some items, like [[Tallbird Eggs]], do not stack due to their unique individual uses.

## Equipable Items
Some items can be placed in equipment slots for use. Each equipped item has its own slot in which it can be placed.
| Hand Items Items ![Image](equip_slot_hud.png =32px) | Head Items Items ![Image](equip_slot_head_hud.png =32px) | Head Items Items that can be placed only on Head Slot ![Image](equip_slot_head_hud.png =32px) | Body Items Items ![Image](equip_slot_body_hud.png =32px) | Body Items Items that can be placed only on Body Slot ![Image](equip_slot_body_hud.png =32px) |

## Backpack Expansion
There are a few ways to expand how much space the player has to store items.

Wearing a [[Backpack]] allows the player 8 more slots to store items, and wearing a [[Piggyback]] gives the player access to 12 extra slots, but slows down movement speed. The [[Krampus Sack]] is a very rare drop from killing [[Krampus]] and a rare drop from the [[Loot Stash]], and gives the player 14 more slots, without a speed penalty. These three items can only be equipped in the body slot.

The [[Quality of Life]] update imports the [[Bundling Wrap]] from {{Pic24|Don't Starve Together icon}} to {{Pic24|Don't Starve icon}}. With it, players can wrap up to 4 stacks of items into [[Bundling Wrap#Bundled_Supplies|Bundled Supplies]], which only takes up one Inventory slot.

![All of the containers available to the player in [[Don't Starve]], including all DLCs.](DS_Containers_All_March.png =320px)

Some [[Structures]] can also be used to store items. They cannot be moved once they are placed, but they can be destroyed with a [[Hammer]]. The simplest form of storage structure is a [[Chest]], each of which has 9 storage slots. [[Ice Box]]es also have 9 storage slots, but they can only hold perishable items (such as Food) and [[Thermal Stone]]s.

Finding and picking up the [[Eye Bone]] will summon [[Chester]], a passive mob who will follow the player around. Chester's mouth can be opened to access 9 storage slots in his belly. The player can also transform Chester into [[Chester#Ch","Inventory, item stacks, equip slots, durability, backpack expansion"

## Quotes

- WX-78: FURRY INSULATION FOR MY WIRES.

- Choose: Winona

## Downloadable Content
In the Hamlet DLC, Belt of Hungers can be bought for 20 Oincs at The Flying Pig Arcane Shop in Pig City, making it renewable in this DLC.

## Tips
- Because Slurpers do not respawn without regenerating the Caves with the Seed of Ruin, it's recommended to use the Sewing Kit on the Belt of Hunger to repair it rather than letting it degrade and crafting a new one.
- A single use of the Sewing Kit restores enough durability to prevent 151 points worth of hunger drain, comparable to Meaty Stew. This makes sewing a Belt of Hunger an extremely efficient way prevent starvation.
- This item is excellent for Wolfgang, as it completely nullifies his hunger problems and for Wigfrid, since her inability to eat non-Meaty foods can be very risky, especially when traveling to distant places from base.
- It's also useful for Wes and Wilbur, due to practically nullifying their increased hunger drain (when running, for the latter).

## Features

Don't Starve Together has multiple ways to play with others: LAN, network, and matchmaking play. Many items have been balanced or removed in order to keep the game fair. PvP are optional by the server operator. Dedicated, player-hosted and LAN servers are available, and chat is global or local depending on the server admin's preference.

### Game Modes

  - We survive together, we die together!
  - Survive through the [[seasons]] and protect yourself from the world.
  - Uncover ancient secrets hidden within the shadows.
  - Grow crops, catch fish, hunt for meat. Whatever you do, don't starve.

  - Cook delicious dishes to appease the [[The Gnaw|Eternal Gnaw]] in this Gate Realm.
  - Enter the world through the [[Ancient Gateway|Mossy Gateway]].
  - No nighttime.
  - Use what you can find to cook offerings for the altar!

### Playstyles

The Playstyles was added in [[A Little Drama and QOL]] update. When creating a new world, the player can choose different modes for the game. There are 5 game modes in total: Relaxed, Endless, Survival, Wilderness, and Light Out. Each mode has different settings that can later be changed in [[World Customization]].

| Playstyle   | Description                                                                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Relaxed    | A more relaxed playstyle with less threats from the world.                                  |
| Endless    | A never-ending Don't Starve sandbox.                                                      |
| Survival   | The standard Don't Starve experience.                                                       |
| Wilderness | Players spawn in random locations across the map.                                            |
| Light Out  | A dark twist on the standard Don't Starve experience.                                       |

### Additional Content

Don't Starve Together includes almost all content of the base game and the [[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]] DLC. Some features from the [[Don't Starve: Shipwrecked|Shipwrecked]] and [[Don't Starve: Hamlet|Hamlet]] DLCs were also introduced over time. Additionally, several new entities were added to re-balance characters, giants, and seasonal mechanics for the multiplayer aspect of the game.

## Rebalancing

Don't Starve Together features [[Caves]] and [[Ruins]], which must be toggled on via a tab in the Server Creation menu. The Caves and Ruins now share the same map level, since each map level requires a separate server.

### Sleeping

Sleeping has been significantly changed. Normally, when going to sleep, the day would fast-forward to sunrise and replenish [[health]] and [[sanity]] at the cost of [[hunger]] upon waking up. However, when on a server, sleeping will not fast forward to sunrise but will instead leave the player unable to move and unaffected by the [[Charlie (Night Monster)|night monster]]. This will replenish health and sanity while draining hunger faster","Don't Starve Together, multiplayer, survival, Klei Entertainment."

## Combat

Combat is a Gameplay mechanism components allow Players or Mobs fight each other and reduces the health of each other.

### Damage Modifiers

Damage Multiplier is the most common Damage Modifier, although they are internally divided into many categories, they are not considered necessary because they are multiplicative calculations and have the same effective scope.

### Physical Damage

#### Definition

Physical Damage is the most common type of damage in the game, and its main feature is that it is absorbed by Armor's Protection.

#### Example:

Attack damage of a [Spider Queen] to a character equipped with a [Grass Suit] and a [Football Helmet] will be distributed as follows:

- 60% ＜ 80%
- 80 × 80% = 64 physical damage is absorbed by two armor
  - 64 × 60%/(80%+60%) ≈ 28 is absorbed by [Grass Suit]
  - 64 × 80%/(80%+60%) ≈ 37 is absorbed by [Football Helmet]
- (80 - 64) = 16 damage is taken by the character's [hp]     *(This is not the final health change, but multiplied by the damage reduction.)*

If it's caused by Mobs or Characters, it's affected by the all kind of Damage Modifiers they have.

Physical Damage also can be reduced by [Damage Reduction] like all kind of damage.

## Downloadable Content
In the Reign of Giants DLC, the Dapper Vest can be used to craft the Hibearnation Vest.

In the Shipwrecked DLC, the Dapper Vest is not available to craft, unless it has been prototyped before in a merged base game or Reign of Giants world.

## Usage
- **Recipe:**
  - **Item 1**: Dapper Vest (1)
  - **Item 2**: Thick Fur (1)
  - **Item 3**: Rope (2)
  - **Result**: Hibearnation Vest
  - **Tool**: Alchemy Engine
  - **DLC**: Reign of Giants

## Trivia
- The Dapper Vest was added in the ""The Birds and the Bees & Dogs That Want to Kill You"" update.
- The Dapper Vest requires Hound's Teeth to make because its pattern is called houndstooth. This is a pun by the developers.
- Because the Dapper Vest restores 3.3 Sanity/min and Rain drains a maximum of 3.3 Sanity/min, the Dapper Vest can be used to negate or reverse the Sanity drain of Rain.
- The Dapper Vest is one out of the two best Sanity restoring body items in the game, excluding the RoG exclusive Hibearnation Vest.
- Along with several other clothing items, the Dapper Vest used to not have any durability.

- **Wheeler:** Great as a teleporter. Horrible as an umbrella.

## Description
The Telebrella is a Character-exclusive Item craftable only by Wagstaff. It is found in the Tinkering Tab and requires an Electrical Doodad and a Pretty Parasol to craft. When equipped in the hand slot, a prompt to ""Use Gadget"" appears where the cursor is on the field, and right-clicking will teleport the character to the nearest Telipad within range.

The Telebrella has a limited range (about a half distance of map radius), meaning the player must be within a certain range of a Telipad for it to be used. If the player ventures too far away from a Telipad, they cannot teleport. The light on top of the device indicates how far away the player is from a Telipad, glowing green when close but will begin to blink and blink faster as the player gets too far away, along with a sound accompanying each blink. If the light is completely dim and makes no noise, the player is too far away and must get closer to the Telipad before it can be used.

The Telebrella can also be used as a melee weapon, but this is not recommended as it deals only 17 damage and breaks after 10 uses.

## Downloadable Content
In the DLCs, the Telebrella has a 35% Wetness protection.

## Tips
- It is impractical to build a Telelocator Focus while having access to the Telebrella (with a Telipad). Even though the Telebrella has a limited range, it's a lot cheaper to use it instead of the Telelocator Focus (The Telebrella costs an Electrical Doodad and a Pretty Parasol to craft, and a Telipad to use, while the Telelocator Focus costs 4 Nightmare Fuel, 4 Living Logs and 8 Gold Nuggets to craft, needing 3 Purple Gems and a Telelocator Staff to use it).
- If the player gets struck by lightning while equipping the Telebrella, it would force the umbrella to activate even when there aren't any Telipads present in the world, resulting in a loss of 1 use. This activation could be exploited because it can help the player teleport to the Telipad even if they aren't within range. Potentially, the player can teleport a further distance with the help of Thunderbirds to get back to base or another important place at the cost of some HP.

![Insight](Insight.png ""Insight"")

Insight is an in-game point system used to progress Skill Trees for Characters in Don't Starve Together. Characters can gain Insight Points and use them to unlock unique Skills. Insight Points are awarded after a number of days survived as the character, up to 15 total points after 68 days. Insight persists between games/worlds, as it is linked to a player's account. Note that time as a Ghost Characters|Ghost does not count toward gaining Insight Points.

There are more Skills to select from than total available Insight, meaning the player must deliberate between which Skills are to be unlocked. A character's unlocked Skills are reset on joining a new world/server, and can be reset in-game via using a Moon Rock Idol on the Celestial Portal in an existing world, allowing players to unlock different skills if they wish.

## Survival

![Wilson-overheat](Wilson-overheat.png =300x)

Overheating can be overcome in two ways: by reducing the player's temperature, and by preventing player's temperature from rising rapidly. Surviving Summer or Dry Season will depend on a combination of these.

### Cooling Down

There are several ways to cool oneself down:

* An Endothermic Fire, Endothermic Fire Pit, or Moon Caller's Staff|Polar Light is a stationary light source that works like a fire, but they cool the player instead.
* A Chilled Amulet, Ice Cube, or Fashion Melon will lower temperature when worn. Note that these have different cooling values. The Ice Cube and Fashion Melon will also cause Wetness while worn, so caution is advised especially as WX-78.
* Using a Luxury Fan or Lucky Fan will lower the player's temperature instantly. The Luxury Fan has 15 uses while the Lucky Fan has 3 uses. However, when used, they put out fires, so the player should be wary around light sources.
* Equipping the Whirly Fan will also lower the player's temperature, but only while the player is running.
* Eating one of the following food items will temporarily cool the player down by 1°C per second for various amounts of time. Eating even stale or spoiled food can also cool the player down.

| Food Item         | Cool Down Time |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Watermelon        | 5 seconds     |
| Fruit Medley      | 5 seconds     |
| Ice               | 7.5 seconds   |
| Melonsicle        | 10 seconds    |
| Ice Cream         | 15 seconds    |
| Ceviche           | 10 seconds    |
| Banana Pop        | 10 seconds    |
| Jelly-O Pop       | 10 seconds    |
| Neon Quattro      | 10 seconds    |
| Tropical Bouillabaisse | 10 seconds |
| Iced Tea         | 10 seconds    |
| Asparagazpacho   | 40 degrees lower than environment for 5 minutes. |

* Wetness will decrease gained temperature up to 30°C at the cost of Sanity and negative effects on items.
* The player can sleep during the day in a Siesta Lean-to to cool down and skip to dusk, thus preventing further overheating.
* A Thermal Stone can be brought near an Endothermic Fire or Endothermic Fire Pit to cool it or placed in a stationary Ice Box or a mobile Snow Chester to freeze it. It will cool the player down as long as it's in stage 1 or stage 2.
* The cheapest way to cool down is to run around a Tree holding a Whirly Fan.

### Delaying Overheating

There are several ways to delay overheating:

* Retreating to the Caves will slow down the rate at which heat is gained (240 Insulation).
* Dusk and Night will slow down the rate at which heat is gained (60/","Overheating, Survival, Cooling Down, Delaying Overheating"

# Bird Trap

## Overview
- **Item Type**: Survival Item
- **Purpose**: Capture winged beasts
- **Ingredients**: 
  - Twigs (3x)
  - Silk (4x)
- **Unlocked at**: Science Machine
- **Durability**: 8 uses
- **Perk**: Captures Birds. Can be baited.

## Description
The Bird Trap is a Survival Item used to catch Birds. It can be crafted using 3 Twigs and 4 Silk, and requires a Science Machine to prototype. Bird Traps can be baited with Seeds to significantly increase the chance of catching a Bird, though it is not a requirement. Using a Feather Hat will increase the number of birds landing to speed up the process.

## Trivia
- Following the ""Naughty and Nice"" update, Feathers and Morsels can no longer be acquired directly using the Trap. Instead, murdering the Bird while it's in the Inventory is now necessary.
- In the old science system, the Bird Trap used to cost 30 Research Points to craft.

## Bugs
- Sometimes Birds will glitch out of Traps after being caught.
- If the Bird Trap is picked up right as it catches a Bird, the Bird may disappear.
- Sometimes the Trap will turn invisible, but will still be shown on the map. The player can press space when near it to get it back.
- In the ""Shipwrecked"" DLC, putting a Seed retrieved from the Ocean inside the Bird Trap may make it look like it's still in the Ocean. Picking up the Bird Trap may cause the Seed to disappear.

"# Cartography Filter

[[File:Cartography Filter.png|thumb|96px|Filter Icon]]

{{Exclusivity|Don't Starve Together}}
{{Quote|Now I can show everyone what I found!|Wilson}}
The **Cartography Filter** is a **Filter** in the crafting menu of **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **A New Reign**. It allows the players to craft items using the **Cartographer's Desk**. Similar to the **Ancient Pseudoscience Filter** and the **Ancient Pseudoscience Station**, items under this Filter cannot be prototyped and then made on the go in the future; in order to craft an item under this Filter, the player must always be near a Cartographer's Desk, no matter how many times the item has been crafted.

## Craftable Items
- **Map Scroll** | [Map Scroll](link=Map Scroll)

## Trivia
* The original Cartography Tab was introduced in the **A Little Fixer Upper** update. With the introduction of **Crafting Filters** in the **March 2022 QoL update**, it was replaced by the Cartography Filter.
* Before the introduction of crafting filters, players were not able to access the Cartography Tab while **Creative Mode** was turned on because the Cartography Tab shared the same space with the **Ancient Tab**.
* **Cartography** is the science and practice of making maps.

The Sea Weed is a plant-like mob exclusive to Don't Starve Together introduced in Return of Them. They appear in groups of 8 to 15 in the Rough Ocean. There are 3 species of Sea Weed: Pink, Yellow, and White.

Every 2.5 to 3.5 minutes (1 to 2 minutes for Pink Sea Weeds), they release a pollen cloud. The cloud attracts nearby Ocean Fishes similarly to Fish Food. If no other fishes are present, one Spittlefish appears. When killed or caught, the Spittlefish regenerates in 4 minutes (2 minutes for White Sea Weeds).

The base of a Sea Weed grows up to 3 Barnacles. They can be harvested directly or by using a Razor. The Barnacles regrow in 2.5 to 4 days each. Upon harvesting, the Sea Weed and all nearby Sea Weeds wake up and attack the player, unless the player is Wormwood or they used Razor when the Sea Weed is sleeping (like during the night).

Sea Weeds attack by launching projectiles in the air. They do 68 damage to the player. If these projectiles miss, they will instead make a leak in the boat. All nearby Sea Weeds will wake up and attack the player if one is attacked or if a Boat is rammed into them too fast. Sea Weeds will not wake up at night, so it is safe to attack one without the others waking.

Upon death, they drop 2 or 3 Seedshells (3 plus two times a 50% chance for Yellow Sea Weed), unharvested Barnacles, one Sea Sprout Starter and a Sea Stack which can be mined for 2 Rocks.

The **Razor** is a craftable **Tool** **Item** found in the **Tools** Tab. It requires 2 **Twigs** and 2 **Flint**s to craft, and a **Science Machine** to prototype. Unlike other Tools, on pc it cannot be equipped, and to be used it has to be lifted and used on a target instead. Players using a **wikipedia:controller** have to simply be near an entity that can be shaved for the ""Shave"" prompt to appear. Since it has no **durability**, the Razor has infinite uses.

The Razor can be used to shave **Wilson**'s Beard, which provides leftover **Beard Hair**. To shave the Beard, simply right-click the Razor while it's in the inventory, or hover over the target. The amount of Beard Hair received depends on the beard's length. The Razor can also be used to shave **Beefalo**s while they are sleeping (whether at night or when put to sleep using **Sleep Dart**s, a **Life Giving Amulet**, or a **Pan Flute**), resulting in 3 **Beefalo Wool**. This requires taking it out of the inventory and hovering over the beefalo. The Beefalo will not wake up after being shaved, but Beefalo in **Beefalo#Mating Season|heat** will sometimes wake up and attack. In **Don't Starve Together|Dont starve together**, you can use a razor to shave **Sea Weed|sea weeds** for up to 3 **barnacles**. This depends on how many barnacles the sea weed has, and will aggravate any nearby sea weeds.

## Downloadable Content

In the **Reign of Giants** DLC, **Webber** can also use the Razor to shave his Beard. The amount of **Silk** received depends on the Beard's length.

At this point, in the **Shipwrecked** DLC, the Razor cannot be used to shave **Water Beefalo**.

In the **Hamlet** DLC, Razors can be used to shave **Hedge**s for 1 **Clippings** each.

## Tips

* Using the Razor to acquire Beefalo Wool is more efficient than killing Beefalo outright since the Wool will eventually regrow allowing players to shave the same Beefalo again for more Wool.
** If players need to kill a Beefalo anyway, it is advised to shave them first for some Wool, since even when shaved, Beefalo will still drop Beefalo Wool on death.
* Wearing a **","Razor, craftable tool, shaves, infinite uses, acquires materials."

A **Sinkhole** is the entrance to a [[Cave]] and can be found randomly in the world. Each Sinkhole leads to a new Cave or Ruin. The cave-side of a sinkhole is a staircase or cave-exit.

When first discovered, the Sinkhole will be a Plugged Sinkhole and is covered with a jagged rubble mound; Player can usually tell they are close to a Plugged Sinkhole on the surface when they find Rocks lying about in the Biomes for no reason. Mining the Plug reveals the hole with a rope going down into its depths while providing [[Flint]] and [[Rock]]s on the surface and [[Thulecite]], as well as [[Thulecite Fragments]] underground. It takes six hits from a [[Pickaxe]] to unplug it. Once unplugged, up to 6 [[Batilisk]]s will spawn quickly from the Sinkhole at dusk and return underground in the morning. If Batilisks are killed, they will respawn at a rate of 1 per minute until the maximum of 6 has been reached.

There are only three Sinkholes in a surface world and one for each Cave. Plugged and open Sinkholes are marked on a [[map]] by a gray mound and a hole with a red arrow pointing downwards, respectively.

On default settings, the three surface Sinkholes are guaranteed to spawn in the following locations:
* A [[Mosaic]] biome.
* A [[Pig Village]] (generally, this village also has a [[Pig King]]).
* The [[Forest]] biome found in the center of the world's [[Marsh]].
The number of sinkholes in the [[Sandbox Mode|world settings]] can only be ""Default"" and ""None"".

Thulecite Sinkholes are usually found on [[Stalagmite Terrain]].

## Quote
""Mind says no. Muscles say yes!"" - Wolfgang

### Origin
Wolfgang is the second playable [[character|Character]] in ''[[Don't Starve]]'' that can be unlocked via [[Experience]], with 320 XP, and one of the playable Characters in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' ({{Pic24|Don't Starve Together icon}}).

### Trivia

  - Wolfgang was added on [[Don't Starve/Version_History#October 2, 2012 - Update|October 2nd, 2012]] when the game was still in Beta.
  - Wolfgang's previous perk, before the ''[[Don't Starve/Version_History#July 2nd, 2013 - Strange New Powers|Strange New Powers]]'' update, was 75 more Health and Hunger (maximum of 225 each), and a 1.5× damage multiplier, similar to his current Mighty Form.
  - Wolfgang's voice is played by a tuba, which changes in pitch depending on his current form.
- Lore
  - Wolfgang was a strongman working in a circus.
  - It is implied that Wolfgang was also in a military.

### Cultural References
- Wolfgang's rather unusual [[Wolfgang quotes|quotes]] may be a reference to the phrase ""brains over brawn,"" in that he has only the latter.
- Wolfgang's eating mechanics may be a reference to strongman training diets which entail eating 10,000 calories a day.

# Floats

Floats are **Items** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. Their sole purpose is to be combined with a **Sea Fishing Rod** to improve the casting range and accuracy of the landing. Most of them can be crafted in the **Fishing Filter**, requiring a **Tackle Receptacle** to prototype, while some of them can also be acquired by trading with the **Crabby Hermit** in the **Bottle Exchange Filter**.

The **Hardened Rubber Bung** Trinket can also be used as a Float, however, it cannot be crafted.

Below is a table of the performance statistics for all Floats.

| Float | Max Range | Range deviation from casting point | Angle deviation from casting point |
|-------|----------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| None  | 5        | 30%                             | 40°                               |

| Wooden Ball Bobber | 9 | 20%                             | 20°                               |

| Hardened Rubber Bung | 13 | 20%                             | 30°                               |
| Jet Quill Float, Crimson Quill Float, Azure Quill Float, Saffron Quill Float | 9 | 15%                             | 15°                               |

## Description
Birchnuts are [[Food]] [[item]]s dropped from [[Birchnut Tree]]s or [[Birchnutter]]s in the ''[[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants|Reign of Giants]]'' DLC. Like [[Pine Cone]]s, Birchnuts can be planted to create a new Birchnut Tree. It takes from 2.5 to 5 minutes for them to grow from saplings into small trees. Birchnuts can alternatively be used as a [[food]] [[:Category:Items|item]] by being [[Cooking|cooked]] on a [[campfire]] and turned into a roasted Birchnut.

Birchnuts can't be planted on [[Checkerboard Flooring]]s, [[Wooden Flooring]]s, [[Cobblestone]]s, [[Carpeted Flooring]]s, [[Rocky Turf]]s, [[Sandy Turf]]s, and [[Cave Rock Turf]]s, unless it has been planted before these [[Turfs]] were placed.

## Fighting Strategy
To fight Swordfish, a boat speed of 7 or above is recommended. Sailing close to the Swordfish will cause it to attack, which can be dodged by sailing in the opposite direction after the Swordfish pauses before the attack. Then players will be able to land 1 to 2 hits with a melee weapon depending on boat speed. Swordfish cannot be stunlocked.

## Usage
### Recipes
1. Dead Swordfish + Cooking = Fish Steak
2. Dead Swordfish + Drying Rack = Jerky
3. Dead Swordfish + Birdcage = Egg
4. Dead Swordfish + Gold Nugget (2) + Twigs (1) = Cutlass Supreme
5. Dead Swordfish = Octopus Chest

## Tips
Once the location of the spawner is found, it can be marked by items that have map markers, like any one of the backpacks, traps, sea traps, or boats as well as a buoy.

## Trivia
There is code in the game files that would allow using alive Swordfish in the Crock Pot, counting as 1 unit of Fish and 0.5 units of Meat. However, there is no method implemented that would make capturing Swordfish alive possible.

"# Freezing

![Wilson shivering from the cold.](Shivering Wilson.png)

""Freezing"" is a game mechanic which makes surviving **Winter** more difficult. Freezing can also occur during the last night of **Autumn** or during heavy rainfall in **Spring**, in the **Don't Starve: Reign of Giants** DLC. Whenever the player is away from a heat source for too long they will begin to freeze.

## Mechanics
Freezing occurs when body temperature drops below **0°**. At **5°**, the edges of the screen will become encrusted with ice, as a warning to the player that they are about to freeze. If a source of heat cannot be found, a second layer of ice crust will form over the edges when body temperature drops below **0°**, causing the player to take damage of **1.25** Health per second. Freezing stops when the body temperature goes above **0°**.

In the absence of a heat source or insulated clothing, the player's body temperature will decrease at a rate of **1°** per second. This rate can be slowed by carrying a charged **Thermal Stone**, wearing insulated **Clothing** or growing a **Beard**. Near a sufficiently warm heat source, the player's body temperature will increase at a maximum rate of **1°** per second when body temperature is above **0°**. If body temperature is below **0°**, it will warm at a maximum rate of **5°** per second.

## Survival

### Fire
The best way to have a reliable and steady source of fire is by having a **Campfire**, **Fire Pit** or a **Star Caller's Staff** Dwarf Star.

In emergencies, objects and even creatures can also be set on fire for an immediate source of warmth. A single flammable item can be dropped on the ground by holding the **CTRL** key and clicking the **LMB**. Once on the ground, such items can be lit on fire with a Torch to provide a small, but limited, amount of heat. With enough fuel, small fires like this can provide enough warmth to get to a better source of heat. This might be dangerous (or advantageous) however as nearby flammable objects can catch fire as well.

### Insulated Clothing
One of the best options for traveling away from a fire during Winter is to wear clothing that provides insulation. These items reduce the rate at which body temperature decreases. Having several items equipped at the same time provides a cumulative bonus. Insulated clothing only delays Freezing, however, and sooner or later the player will be forced to return to a source of warmth. There are three tiers of clothing, each allowing the player to be away from a fire longer than the lower tiers.

### Other Options
- **Thermal Stones** can be used to store heat.
- **Wilson**'s and **Webber**'s **Beards** provide additional insulation, depending on their length. In **Don't Starve Together** only, **Woodie**'s beard will also provide insulation.
- **Werebeaver** has additional insulation.
- **Willow's Lighter** produces a very small amount of heat, but can also be used to light surroundings on fire for emergency heat.
- When **WX-78** is experiencing System Overload, they are immune to Freezing. (Not applicable in **Don't Starve Together**)
- (Single-Player version only) Items can be set on fire in the inventory to warm oneself, but as your character is technically on fire, only Willow can benefit from this and one should avoid flammable objects to avoid setting them aflame.

## Game Mechanics

Freezing mechanics are based on the temperature implementations in the game. A player character has a **body temperature**, which ranges from **-20°** to **40°** (**90°** in DLCs and DST). Any time body temperature falls below **0°**, the character will take **1.25** damage per second.

### Rate of Temperature Change
Ambient temperature is a key factor influencing a character's body temperature. Body temperature will attempt to match the ambient temperature at one of two rates: the **ambient delta** which is determined by all heat and cold sources, or the **insulated rate** which depends on insulation values of clothing worn by the character. The rate is in degrees per second, and the game will choose whichever value is larger.

#### Ambient Delta
The **ambient delta** is a rate that takes into account the total effect of all heat sources affecting the player, including the weather, campfires, and Thermal Stones. It is also a function of the player's current temperature.

The rate determined by the ambient delta is given by:

```
ambient_delta = min('warming_cap', sum(net_temp_eff('source') for all sources))
```

* Maxwell: Beautiful on the outside, destructive on the inside.

The Howling Conch is a craftable Item introduced in the Don't Starve: Shipwrecked DLC. It is found in the Volcanic Tab and requires 4 Obsidian, 1 Purple Gem, and 1 Magic Seal to craft. Like all items in the Volcanic Tab, it cannot be prototyped and the player must be near an Obsidian Workbench or wearing a Brain of Thought to craft it.

Using the Howling Conch will start Strong Winds lasting for about half a Day. When taken to a base game world or Reign of Giants world with the Seaworthy or Skyworthy, the conch will create Rain instead of Strong Winds lasting for about half a Day. This allows for a Reign of Giants world in Summer to not trigger smoldering as long as the Rain stays.

## Tips
* The Sail Stick can be equipped after blowing the Howling Conch for half a day of boosted sailing speed, but a Walking Cane still provides a greater speed boost when sailing with the wind.
* Using the Howling Conch while its effects are still active may initiate a hurricane outside of Hurricane Season with the associated rain and lightning. This is useful for WX-78 players in need of Overcharge or Walani players who want more waves to ride during Dry Season.

## Bugs
* The light of day will become dimmer when using the Howling Conch in a Don't Starve or Reign of Giants due to the Rain.
* Sometimes when trying to create Rain, the Howling Conch will not work until the light of day (not exactly when it becomes the afternoon) becomes dimmer.

## Trivia
* The crafting menu description and Woodie's quote reference the song ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" by Canadian musician Gordon Lightfoot.

# Incomplete Guide to Wigfrid - The Performance Artist

## Background

Wigfrid is a character that combines traits from two other characters, Wolfgang and Woodie, with some modifications. She has a constant damage multiplier of 1.25, which is higher than most characters, and takes less damage from most attacks (0.75). Her stats are 120 hunger, 200 health, and 120 sanity. Killing any hostile/neutral mob results in 25% of its attack damage being converted to her health and sanity.

## Pros & Cons

Wigfrid's primary limitation is her inability to eat non-meat items, which can make the early game challenging. However, she starts with excellent gear, including the Battle Helm and Battle Spear, which provide good damage absorption and combat capabilities. Her combat prowess allows her to gain health and sanity boosts upon killing mobs.

## Strategy #1: Early Game Days (1-20)

In the early days, focus on gathering resources such as wood, setting traps, and mining. Collect berries and carrots for bait in rabbit traps. Burn trees for charcoal and explore to locate resources such as rabbit holes, frog ponds, buzzards, beefalo herds, tallbird clans, pig villages, pig kings, spider dens, and marshes. Set up camp near a marsh or savanna for meat, reeds, and silk. Produce jerky or bacon and eggs to help with hunger management.

## Strategy #2: Utilizing Combat-Based Gain

Wigfrid benefits from killing enemies, so consider targeting Tallbirds, Buzzards, Beefalo, Tentacles, Rabbits, Koalefants, Pigs, and Bosses for health, sanity, and resource gains.

## Suggested Items

- **Ham Bat/Tentacle Spike**: Depending on playstyle, choose between the high-damage Ham Bat or the consistent Tentacle Spike.
- **Bat Bat**: Provides faster, more reliable regeneration due to Wigfrid's damage multiplier.

The **Crocommander** is a hostile mob in **The Forge** event exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, and is the second enemy to be encountered. They appear to be bipedal crocodiles with spiked, purple armor.

Like all The Forge mobs, the Crocommander's drops are dependant on what round it is, as well as what items have already been dropped.

### Behavior

Like all mobs in The Forge, Crocommanders spawn from the three [[Forge Portal]]s around the arena. Crocommanders have two attacks: They can bite players who are nearby or they can shoot a blob of green liquid for a ranged attack, which cannot be dodged, making them the only ranged mob in The Forge, other than the [[Grand Forge Boarrior]]. In Round 10, Crocommanders may be problematic to the kiter if they are allowed to aggro on them because the long-distance spit will be a hazard kiting not only them, but the [[Boarilla]] as well; a hit may let the Boarilla get off a free punch. Crocommanders, when summoned, will be spawned with 3 Pit Pigs in Rounds 5 and 6, and 2 Pit Pigs in Round 10; these Pit Pigs will defend the Crocommander against the player who has the aggro of the Crocommander. If the player who has aggro on the Crocommander is at a far enough distance, more so for the Crocommander to use his range spit attack, the Crocommander typically tends to pursuit the player until aggro is automatically given to a different player.

# Lures in Don't Starve Together

Lures are **Items** exclusive to **Don't Starve Together**, introduced in **Return of Them**. They are placed in the lure slot of the **Sea Fishing Rod** to improve its attractiveness to **Ocean Fishes**. Different lures have different effects over various species of fishes as some might be completely ineffective in attracting them while others might be best suited for certain fishes. Some lures are simple baits such as seeds, rot, and berries while others are spoons and spinners that can be crafted in the **Fishing Filter** which is be accessed through the **Tackle Receptacle**. 

The **Bent Spork** trinket can also be used as a lure.

## Usage
The hook of the Sea Fishing Rod is already able to catch every saltwater fish by itself without a lure placed in the lure slot but it is rather ineffective in this regard, with a low chance of a fish biting it. Adding any other lure greatly increases the chance of fishes biting the hook, although some fishes cannot be lured by certain lures while most are very effective for catching certain fishes. Additionally lures also affect the radius and range of the Sea Fishing Rod.  

- The **radius** refers to the maximal distance for an Ocean Fish to be attracted by the lure. Bigger the radius is, more fishes around the float are lured into the bait.
- The **range bonus** is a bonus to the **Sea Fishing Rod** casting range. Some lures offer a small bonus to this casting distance.
- The **attractiveness** quantifies the speed at which fishes bite the lure; the higher the value, the faster the fish bite. The lure can gain an attractiveness **reel bonus** if the player reel the line. The bonus decays in 2 seconds.

**Rot**, **Seeds**, and **Crop Seeds**, **Berries** and **Juicy Berries** are single use only, as catching a fish will end up consuming the said lure. The attractiveness of Seeds and Berries also depends proportionally on their freshness.

The craftable lures and the **Bent Spork**, on the other hand, will retain themselves as long as they aren't lost through a failed reeling. When a fish manages to get away after biting the lure, the lure that was used to attract the fish is lost along with the float that was used.

The **Sunrise**, **Dusky**, and **Nightflyer** lures are only 100% effective during **Day-Night Cycle** respectively, and they retain only 30% of their attraction outside of their relevant time of the day.

The attraction of all lures is reduced by 50% during **Rain** or **Winter#Snow**. Exceptions to this are the **Rainy Day Lure** which is 100% effective during rain and 0% otherwise, and the **Snow Day Lure** which is 100% effective during snow and 0% otherwise.

The **Stupefying Lure** drains the fish's stamina more quickly, making it easier to catch the fish once it has taken the bait.

The **Heavy Weighted Lure** attracts only fish that weigh more than 80% of the maximum weight for their type.

Each species of **Ocean Fishes** have an affinity for different Lures. The affinity modifies the perceived attractiveness.

| Lures / Bait | Radius | Range Bonus | Attractiveness | Idle | Reel bonus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | 1 |  | 0.1 | +0 | 0.25 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Craftable Lures
### Spoons and Spinnerbaits
The **Spoons** and the **Spinnerbaits** exert their effects depending on the **Day-Night Cycle**. They provide 100% of the efficacy when they are in the correct period in the cycle, and 30% otherwise. The Spoons are universal to small and medium fish, while the Spinnerbait only attracts medium fish but gives better efficacy.

# Ruins

A relic of an ancient civilization long dead from the ravages of time. - Wickerbottom

![A Ruins Sinkhole](Ruins Entrance.png){width=169px height=169px}

The Ruins are the last remnants of a forgotten civilization located on a level below Caves. They are generated as a new world upon entering them, just like Caves. The Ruins have their own theme, terrain, and biomes. Various unique creatures, plants, and other objects reside within.

## Entrance

The entrance to the Ruins are in the Caves. Each Cave connects to a different Ruins world. Similar to Sinkhole Rocks, they resemble a pile of Thulecite, which is found in the Ruins itself. It is tinted orange, with similar characteristics of the Sinkhole when being mined.

The pile of Thulecite is usually guarded by Spilagmites and Cave Spiders or a Rabbit Hutch village and it can spawn at a random place at any biome most likely at Stalagmite Terrain biome or sunken forest biome.

## Exploration

![A fully explored Ruins map](Ruinsmap.png){width=324px height=324px}

The Ruins have six different Biomes: Abyss, Labyrinth, Military, Sacred, Village, and Wilds. The Ruins can only be entered through a plugged Sinkhole found in the Caves. Upon mining the Thulecite plug, a rope will lead down to the Ruins through the Sinkhole, and Batilisks will be able to spawn from it into the Caves.

The initial starting area of the Ruins is surrounded by four massive pillars and four Broken Clockworks, with a rope leading up to the Caves. The Ruins are completely dark, causing a steady drain on Sanity. Unlike the caves, the ruins are considered to be in a state of perpetual night, since creatures and plants will act accordingly. As the Ruins are explored, sections of the map will show new icons and terrain specific to the Ruins.

Earthquakes will occur in the Ruins, dropping the same minerals as in the Caves. Although time continues to pass on the surface world, there is no indication of this while underground.

## Nightmare Cycle

The Ruins exist in a state of flux called the Nightmare Cycle, which can be measured by the Thulecite Medallion. As the magical state becomes more intense, the likelihood of earthquakes increases. Its current state will affect the state of objects within it. Nightmare Lights will begin to open up, Runic Turf will glow red, and Ancient Statues will have a horrified look with Nightmare Fuel leaking from their mouths and eyes. Shadow Creatures can attack the player regardless of their sanity level during the most intense stage. This is a great way to collect Nightmare Fuel, but is a bit overwhelming at an early stage in the game. The runes on the ground do not provide a light source despite glowing brightly.

## Creatures

![A Slurper](Slurper.png){width=150px}

The following creatures can be found in the Ruins:
- Depths Worm
- Shadow Creatures
- Slurper
- Splumonkey
- Dangling Depth Dweller
- Damaged Bishop
- Damaged Knight
- Damaged Rook
- Ancient Guardian

Friendly damaged Clockwork Monsters can be made ""Followers"" by repairing Damaged Clockworks with Gears.

## Features

![A Ruins pillar](Ruins pillar.png){width=252px height=252px}

Some of the ground and pillars in the Ruins are made out of a special material that starts to glow when light is shined upon it during the Nightmare Phase. The Military and Sacred biomes are mostly covered in this material. Also somewhere in the ruins there's a labyrinth, filled with Dangling Depth Dwellers, Ornate Chests and dead ends. At the center of this labyrinth resides the Ancient Guardian, who most players will challenge to get its rare Horn.

Unlike Caves, surface plants like Evergreens, Saplings, Berry Bushes, Spiky Bushes, and Flowers are not found in the Ruins, although the player can still plant these items. Plants will regenerate after a few days of being harvested (except for trees). The only plants that can be found naturally in the ruins are Light Flowers, Cave Banana Trees, and Ferns. Lichen is also exclusive to the ruins. Blue Mushrooms can be found here as well, usually in copious amounts.

![An Ancient Statue during the Nightmare Phase](Nightmare Ancient.png){width=238px height=238px}

Objects found in the Ruins include Relics, Ancient Statues, Nightmare Lights and the Ancient Pseudoscience Station. Relics can be attacked and destroyed for various loot while Ancient Statues can be mined to yield Thulecite and various Gems. Nightmare Lights can emit","Ruins: ancient civilization, unique biomes, creatures, Nightmare Cycle."

The **Cork Candle Hat** is a craftable **Hat** **Item** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. It is found in the **Light Tab**, requires 4 **Cork** and 2 **Iron Ore** to craft, and a **Science Machine** to prototype. It serves as a light source providing a slightly smaller radius of light than the **Torch**.

The greatest differences from the **Torch**, and what justifies the use of better ingredients, is that it can be refueled with **Cork** for 37.5% (45s) and be worn on the head. This allows for infinite use and frees the handslot for other **Tools** or **Weapons**.

Unlike the **Torch**, the durability drainage is not affected by **Rain**, however it still provides 20% **wetness** resistance when equipped.

### Trivia
- Clicking the Cork Candle Hat with the Left Mouse Button rapidly while it is equipped will cause the item not to lose its durability.

"# Don't Starve: Console Edition PS4 and PS3 Guide

## Introduction
This guide covers some of the features, exploits, and general problems specifically for Don't Starve: Console Edition PS4 and PS3. This content is subject to change, following future updates and patches. This guide does not promote any of the exploits!

## Pause to sort your inventory
In the PS4 and PS3 editions, pressing **R2** on the controller will pause the game and open up a sorting screen, making it possible to equip or sort items out without fear. This can be useful when refueling a Miner Helmet or during unexpected attacks. This feature can also be activated after opening a chest. Items can be equipped or dropped. Sanity, Hunger, and Health is also displayed during pause mode. A Life Giving Amulet can be equipped at the last moment, without having to constantly wear it.

## Crashing
### PS4 Edition
The PS4 edition has some CPU problems in certain situations. The most notable is tight packed tree farms. Plant tree farms away from base/camp areas or space out the trees to reduce load on the system. The game is more prone to crash in winter, regardless of tree farm size. Walking through a tree farm can overload the system. Autosaves generally make this a minor issue.

### PS3 Edition
The PS3 edition of Don't Starve Giant Edition also has a chance of crashing when entering a cave. The screen will load the cave world and then go directly to a ""Warning!"" screen telling the player that the savedata is empty on load cave. Any attempt to reload the game will result in receiving the same warning screen (Rev -1 PS3).

The game may crash when it auto-saves (at the start of a new day), making all activities that had been done before the save redundant. It does not corrupt data however, it is just an inconvenience that can happen and when it happens multiple times in a row it can be disheartening. It doesn't seem to crash (as often) on a smaller world, this could be that a larger world is quite demanding on the console and therefore cause the game to crash. The game's music still plays after it crashes.

## Collecting dropped items
Hold **X** to collect items faster. This makes items like the Lazy Forager less important. A problem to be noted is you will need to avoid allowing your character to be next to a tree stump or other such objects, since they will lock on to that instead.

## Problems with Lureplants
Planting too many Lureplants together on man-made turfs may cause issues, due to the problems with the lock-on mechanics registering certain items you wish to pick up. The same issues apply to chests and firepits with heat stones.","Don't Starve Console Edition guide, PS4 and PS3 tips"

# Refined Materials Filter

![Refine Icon](Icon Refine.png){:target=""_blank""}

> ""I WILL REFINE THESE INTO HIGH TECHNOLOGY."" - WX-78

Refine items are utilized in the construction of items that are more challenging to obtain, necessitating large quantities of a specific resource. For instance, to acquire any item requiring four Boards, the player must gather 16 Logs. A total of eight items fall under the Refine category, or 13 in the Shipwrecked DLC. Refine Items are typically used in Tier Two recipes, such as the Alchemy Engine. Purple Gems and Nightmare Fuel are often used in Magic recipes, like the Shadow Manipulator. The Refine tab is not unlocked at the start of the game but becomes accessible through a Science Machine.

## Downloadable Content

In the Shipwrecked DLC, players can refine materials into Cloth, Limestone, Gold Nuggets, Coral Nubbins, Ice, and Empty Bottles in the Refine Tab.

The Hamlet DLC adds Claw Palm Saplings and Venom Glands to this tab. Additionally, it includes an alternative crafting recipe for Gold Nuggets.

## Craftable Items

The following items can be crafted in the Refine Tab:

## File: Wilson using a Beefalo Horn

## File: Beefalo Hold
![Using the Beefalo Horn to lead Beefalo into a pen](Beefalo Hold.png)

A Beefalo Horn is an Item dropped 33% of the time after killing a Beefalo. When blown, the Beefalo Horn uses 10% of its durability and causes up to 5 grown Beefalo to follow the character for the rest of the current day or until they meet up with the player, as at night Beefalo will stop following and go to sleep. They will move at their walking speed and will not fight hostile creatures the way that following Pigs do. Baby Beefalo still follow their parents, which means that they will also move; however, the Horn will not cause them to leave their parents.

The Beefalo will stay in the general area they last slept. This way, it is possible to lead them into a walled ""pen"" (so they won't wander off) close to a camp for a steady supply of Manure, Beefalo Wool, and/or Meat. Be careful, though - when mating season comes, having them too close to camp can be a nightmare, as they will smash walls and cause a lot of damage before the player has much time to react.

Beefalo Horns can also be used to calm Beefalo who have been angered. However, a Beefalo in heat will continue to attack if too close.

## Usage
### Recipe 
- **item1**: Beefalo Wool
- **count1**: 8
- **item2**: Beefalo Horn
- **tool**: Science Machine
- **result**: Beefalo Hat

## Tips
- Use the Beefalo Horn during mating season to make killing Treeguard, the Deerclops, Spider Queens, and other Monsters easier.
- Beefalo will follow the player through Worm Holes when the horn is used, making it handy to move herds to new locations where they may be sparse.
- When herding Beefalo into a pen, it is helpful to have them follow at dusk. Even though only 5 of them will follow the player at once, the remaining herd will follow suit as they attempt to keep the group together. As an additional benefit, the entire herd will stay wherever they were put when they go to sleep.
- If penning Beefalo in a walled area, it is best to keep the pen several screen lengths away from a base camp. During mating season, the herd will break down walls to get to any mob that wanders too close. By keeping them a few screens away, they are","Beefalo Horn, durability, follows player, herding, Wool, Hat, mating season."

# {{Instructional}}

Some of you may have troubles making sure to get enough **food** to last you through the game, or maybe you can't seem to get the right food. My aim in this guide is to help you ensure that you have sustainable and profitable food sources.

Once you get the hang of collecting food, it isn't too hard to get it, because there is almost always more from where it came from.

Keep in mind this is most RoG (**Reign of Giants** DLC) content, though I will make sure to separate vanilla content from any DLC content to make sure nobody gets mixed up.

This is my third guide, and my other two are always being worked on, it may and will take a while to finalize this one.

## Early Game Food

Before you get a **Science Machine** and **Alchemy Engine**, you don't have as much of a steady food supply. However, there are ways to ensure your early game survival.

When you first spawn, you may want to collect as many **Berries** as possible. You find them on **Berry Bushes**, of course. There are **Carrots**, but only pick those when you need them badly. Unlike the Berries, they are a limited food source without farming, and do not spoil in the ground, so leaving them in the ground until they're completely needed is a good idea. They also make great food when exploring in **Winter**, as berries grow at a much, much slower rate if at all.

Unless you're unlucky, you probably don't need to dig into your **Carrot** supply. In the early game, farming **Rabbits** is one of the best things you can do. **Traps** only cost six **Cut Grass** and two **Twigs**. It is one of the best ways to obtain food, especially early game, trust me. I've gotten over a stack of **Cooked Morsel**s from it before. Make as many Traps as possible, but don't bait them; Place them over the **Rabbit Holes**, so the Rabbits will be caught when leaving or exiting. Sometimes, they won't get caught, but it's better than baiting it. When you bait them, you lose the bait, and your trap amount is restricted to the amount of food you can put in them. It's much more profitable when you just put it over the hole. Collect the Rabbits a bit after dawn and right after they go home for the **Dusk** and **Night**. Make sure not to pick them up right when day hits, as they don't come out as soon as it does. However, they do scurry back home as soon as its dusk. When you collect them at the beginning and end of the day, it makes it possible to go and collect **Twigs**, **Grass**, **Berries**, **Rocks**, **Flint**, **Gold** and anything else you may find, and it gives you more time to explore. Dusk and Dawn are the times the most get caught, and if you reset it after you collect it, you get a lot of food. It is also possible to put down a carrot or berry, and wait until a Rabbit comes over to eat it, and kill them. However, other Rabbits will rush into their holes, making this ineffective unless you are desperate. This also makes you have to stalk it, and it's slow because they're slowly walking, which can get annoying when you should be gathering resources. This also does not catch live Rabbits, which is important because you need to watch your naughtiness. When you cook them alive, it counts as the **Fire** doing the killing and does not effect you badly in any way. If you are playing RoG, the Rabbits will starve to death in the trap or in your **inventory**, so be careful. Rabbits are even useful to farm late game if you can't find other foods or you're uncomfortable with the amount you have.

When picking Berries, there is a chance for a **Gobbler** to spawn. It is a turkey-like creature and you'll know it when you see it. Pick up all **Red Mushrooms** (Or red caps) you see, as when they spawn you can put 3 down and it'll kill the Gobbler, resulting in two **Drumsticks**. Red Caps should only be eaten when starving in early game, due to their -20 health penalty. When cooked, they yield no hunger, so that is not helpful, especially compared to the wonders of **Drumsticks**.

So here are the best early game food sources (Keep in mind that this list will change and grow over time):
* Berries
* Rabbits
* Gobblers

Alright, here are some food sources that require a Science Machine/Alchemy Engine. Some of these can be","sustainable food sources, early game survival, gather resources, farming rabbits"

## Description
Mumsy is a [[Mob]] exclusive to the [[The Gorge]] [[:Category:Events|event]] in ''[[Don't Starve Together]]'' and the first character encountered when entering The Gorge world. She instructs players to start cooking to appease [[The Gnaw]] and gives them 10 Old Coins with which they can purchase cooking items from herself, her son [[Billy]], [[Pipton]], and [[Sammy]]. Players cannot buy from anyone else until interacting with her. She will also inform players of the Gnaw's current craving as well as how the Gnaw liked the food after it was snackrificed.

## Trading
Mumsy sells the following cooking items:

| Item | Old Coin | Result | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cookpot Kit | 6 | Cookpot Kit | ""Everything you need to set up a cookpot."" |
| Oven Kit | 6 | Oven Kit | ""Everything you need to set up an oven."" |
| Grill Kit | 6 | Grill Kit | ""Everything you need to set up a grill."" |
| Silver Plate | 2 Sapphire Medallion | Silver Plate | ""High class plating for improved dishes."" |

Anything bought by [[Wes]] costs one less Old Coin or Sapphire Medallion, except for items bought with Red Marks or Gnaw's Favors. The Favors are required to charge the key instead of buying it.

## Quotes
Note: For Mumsy's Gnaw craving hints, lines from part 1 and part 2 are randomly matched to one another, but a part 2 is only chosen if the part 1 has a space for it. The craving itself changes depending on how much progress the player has made in the round.

## The Wooden Thing (commonly referred to as the Teleportato, when completed) is a unique Structure in Don't Starve. It spawns naturally in every world in its own Set Piece. It is guarded by 1 Clockwork Rook, 2 Clockwork Knights, and 2 Clockwork Bishops. The area is also surrounded by Evil Flowers and Marble Trees laid on a Chess Biome.

There are two versions of it, one that spawns in Survival Mode and one in Adventure Mode, that differ in their color schemes. In Adventure Mode, the Set Piece in which it spawns also lacks the Clockwork Rook and the fully assembled Teleportato requires a Divining Rod to unlock it (activate). Players can craft a Divining Rod to help them track down the Wooden Thing.

The Teleportato is built by combining the Wooden Thing with the Metal Potato Thing, Box Thing, Ring Thing, and the Crank Thing (in any order). Note that each 'Thing' component will spawn in a different area of the map. A completed Teleportato can then be activated, allowing the player to journey to a newly generated world. Shadow Hands will emerge from the ground to pull the player through to the next world. Using the Teleportato is one-way. Upon traveling to the new world, the previous world is destroyed, and the player cannot return to it.

In Survival Mode, items in the player's inventory will be transferred to the new world (including items in an equipped Backpack). In Adventure Mode, players can only take 4 items through a Teleportato. The Eye Bone and Divining Rod will always turn into Ashes after being carried through a Teleportato. The player retains any unlocked crafting recipes and pre-built structures (by crafting items with the required materials, but not placing them immediately afterward). WX-78 retains any upgraded stats. Beard length is also retained, as long as either Webber or Wilson is selected for the new Character. In Survival Mode, any customization to World Customization will still apply in the new world. Upon arriving in the new world, the player's character will retain their Health, Sanity, and Hunger values from the previous world. However, if they had less than 20% Health, 30% Sanity or 40% Hunger, their respective values will be set to these minimums when entering the new world.

After traveling through a Teleportato, the player will gain Experience based on the number of days survived, and will be given the option to play as a different Character in the next world (except in Adventure Mode).

## Quote
""You haven't heard the last of Maybelle Dorothea Wheeler!"" - Wheeler

### Maybelle Dorothea Wheeler
Maybelle Dorothea Wheeler is a **Character** exclusive to the **Don't Starve: Hamlet** DLC. Wheeler is the tenth character to be unlocked via **Experience**, requiring 3200 XP to become available. She is an adventure-seeking aeronaut who crashed her hot air balloon and became lost in **The Constant**.

## Trivia
- Wheeler was officially added to the **Hamlet** Early Access beta branch on **April 18, 2019**, alongside **Wagstaff**.[^1]
- Wheeler is voiced by a ragtime piano.
- In the roadmap forum post where she was first teased, she was described as ""''a globetrotting adventurer lost and alone.''""[^2]
- On the [Steam page for **Hamlet**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/712640/Dont_Starve_Hamlet/), she is described as ""''A gutsy aeronaut whose latest adventure has blown off course.''""
- Her middle name, Dorothea, may be a reference to **Dorothy** of **The Wonderful Wizard of Oz**.
- In her original in-game design, she had a frown and neutral eyebrows. In the **Early Access update 329526**, it was changed to give her a smile and angled eyebrows similar to her character portrait.[^3] Images depicting her previous design can be found in the **gallery**.
- During the first versions of **Hamlet**, Wheeler used to have 15 inventory slots and her base **movement speed** was 10% higher compared to other characters. She also used to have 10 inventory slots and 150 **Hp**.
- She has a history playing stick ball.[^4]
- Her health is the second least in the singleplayer version of the game, the first being **Maxwell**'s.
- Wheeler is one of the five characters whose full name is known, the others being **Maxwell**, **Wilson**, **Wendy**, and **Wagstaff**.
- When struck by **Lightning**, Wheeler is shown to have bones in her hair, much like other characters.
- Wheeler seems to love scrambled eggs, based off of her quotes for multiple egg foods, such as **Doydoy Eggs**, **Fried Tallbird Eggs**, and **Cooked Eggs**.
